“let go—and clue up!” last command sails lowered,

“yes—yes: poor captain leclere! brave honest man.”
 
“and first-rate seaman, one seen long honorable service,
 became man charged interests house important as

“but,” replied owner, glancing dantès, watching the
 anchoring vessel, “it seems sailor needs so

“yes,” said danglars, darting edmond look gleaming hate.
 “yes, young, youth invariably self-confident. scarcely was

 without consulting anyone, caused us lose day half at
 island elba, instead making marseilles direct.”

“as taking command vessel,” replied morrel, “that his
 duty captain’s mate; losing day half island of

“the vessel good condition am, as, hope are,

 pleasure going ashore, nothing else.”
 
“dantès,” said shipowner, turning towards young man, “come this
 way!”
 
“in moment, sir,” answered dantès, “and i’m you.” calling
 crew, said, “let go!”
 
anchor instantly dropped, chain ran rattling through
 port-hole. dantès continued post spite presence of

 “half-mast colors, square yards!”
 
“you see,” said danglars, “he fancies captain already, upon my
 word.”
 
“and so, fact, is,” said owner.
 
“except signature partner’s, m. morrel.”
 
“and this?” asked owner; “he young, is
 true, seems thorough seaman, full experience.”
 
cloud passed danglars’ brow.

 suddenly—
 
“and emperor?”
 
“very well, far judge sight him.”
 
“you saw emperor, then?”
 
“he entered marshal’s apartment there.”
 
“and spoke him?”
 
“why, spoke me, sir,” said dantès, smile.
 
“and say you?”

 continued he, patting edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you right,
 dantès, follow captain leclere’s instructions, touch elba,
 although known conveyed packet the

“of packet speaking, danglars?”
 
“why, dantès left porto-ferrajo.”
 
“how know packet leave porto-ferrajo?”

dantès blushed.
 
“ah, ha,” said shipowner, “i least surprised, she

“she mistress,” replied young sailor, gravely; “she my

“that’s right, edmond. there’s providence watches the

“i love edmond dantès,” young girl calmly replied, “and none but
 edmond shall ever husband.”
 
“and will always love him?”
 
“as long live.”
 
fernand let fall head like defeated man, heaved sigh was
 like groan, suddenly looking full face, with
 clenched teeth expanded nostrils, said,—“but dead——”
 
“if dead, shall die too.”
 
“if forgotten you——”
 
“mercédès!” called joyous voice without,—“mercédès!”
 
“ah,” exclaimed young girl, blushing delight, fairly
 leaping excess love, “you see forgotten me, here

“ah, pardon,” said dantès, frowning turn; “i not
 perceive three us.” then, turning mercédès, he
 inquired, “who gentleman?”
 
“one will best friend, dantès, friend, my
 cousin, brother; fernand—the man whom, you, edmond, i
 love best world. remember him?”
 
“yes!” said dantès, without relinquishing mercédès’ hand clasped in
 one own, extended catalan cordial
 air. fernand, instead responding amiable gesture,
 remained mute trembling. edmond cast eyes scrutinizingly
 agitated embarrassed mercédès, gloomy
 menacing fernand. look told all, anger waxed hot.
 
“i know, came haste you, meet
 enemy here.”
 
“an enemy!” cried mercédès, angry look cousin. “an enemy

fernand’s eye darted lightning. “and misfortune occur to
 you, dear edmond,” continued calmness proved to
 fernand young girl read innermost depths his
 sinister thought, “if misfortune occur you, ascend

fernand became deadly pale. “but deceived, edmond,” she
 continued. “you enemy here—there one fernand, my

 catalan, who, fascinated it, came slowly towards edmond, and
 offered hand. hatred, like powerless though furious wave,
 broken strong ascendancy mercédès exercised over
 him. scarcely, however, touched edmond’s hand felt he
 done do, rushed hastily house.
 
“oh,” exclaimed, running furiously tearing hair—“oh, who
 will deliver man? wretched—wretched am!”
 
“hallo, catalan! hallo, fernand! running to?” exclaimed a
 voice.
 
young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, perceived

“well”, said caderousse, “why don’t come? really a

“particularly still full bottle them,” added
 danglars. fernand looked stupefied air, not

“he seems besotted,” said danglars, pushing caderousse knee.
 “are mistaken, dantès triumphant spite have
 believed?”
 
“why, must inquire that,” caderousse’s reply; turning
 towards young man, said, “well, catalan, can’t make your
 mind?”
 
fernand wiped away perspiration steaming brow, slowly
 entered arbor, whose shade seemed restore somewhat calmness

 exhausted body.
 
“good-day,” said he. “you called me, didn’t you?” fell, rather
 sat down, one seats surrounded table.
 
“i called running like madman, afraid

 “why, man friends, offer glass of
 wine, but, moreover, prevent swallowing three four pints of
 water unnecessarily!”
 
fernand gave groan, resembled sob, dropped head into
 hands, elbows leaning table.
 
“well, fernand, must say,” said caderousse, beginning the
 conversation, brutality common people which
 curiosity destroys diplomacy, “you look uncommonly like rejected
 lover;” burst hoarse laugh.
 
“bah!” said danglars, “a lad make born unhappy in
 love. laughing him, caderousse.”
 
“no,” replied, “only hark sighs! come, come, fernand,” said
 caderousse, “hold head, answer us. it’s polite to
 reply friends ask news health.”
 
“my health well enough,” said fernand, clenching hands without
 raising head.
 
“ah, see, danglars,” said caderousse, winking friend, “this

 one best fishermen marseilles, love very
 fine girl, named mercédès; appears, unfortunately, fine

“no; understand,” said danglars.
 
“poor fernand dismissed,” continued caderousse.
 
“well, then?” said fernand, lifting head, looking
 caderousse like man looks someone vent his
 anger; “mercédès accountable person, she? not
 free love whomsoever will?”
 
“oh, take sense,” said caderousse, “it another
 thing. thought catalan, told catalans
 men allow supplanted rival. was
 even told fernand, especially, terrible vengeance.”
 
fernand smiled piteously. “a lover never terrible,” said.
 
“poor fellow!” remarked danglars, affecting pity young man from
 bottom heart. “why, see, expect see dantès
 return suddenly—he thought dead, perhaps; perchance
 faithless! things always come us severely come
 suddenly.”
 
“ah, _ma foi_, circumstances!” said caderousse, drank as
 spoke, fumes wine began take
 effect,—“under circumstances fernand person put out
 fortunate arrival dantès; he, danglars?”
 
“no, right—and say bring ill-luck.”
 
“well, never mind,” answered caderousse, pouring glass wine
 fernand, filling eighth ninth time, while
 danglars merely sipped his. “never mind—in meantime marries
 mercédès—the lovely mercédès—at least returns that.”
 
time danglars fixed piercing glance young man,
 whose heart caderousse’s words fell like molten lead.
 
“and wedding be?” asked.
 
“oh, yet fixed!” murmured fernand.
 
“no, will be,” said caderousse, “as surely dantès will be
 captain _pharaon_—eh, danglars?”
 
danglars shuddered unexpected attack, turned caderousse,

“well,” said he, filling glasses, “let us drink captain edmond

“do know them, fernand?” said.
 
“yes,” reply, low voice. “it edmond mercédès!”
 
“ah, see there, now!” said caderousse; “and recognize them!

“do invent, then,” said fernand impatiently.
 
“waiter,” said danglars, “pen, ink, paper.”
 
“pen, ink, paper,” muttered fernand.

 like confirmed toper was, lifted hand paper and
 seized glass.
 
catalan watched caderousse, almost overcome fresh
 assault senses, rested, rather dropped, glass upon the
 table.
 
“well!” resumed catalan, saw final glimmer of
 caderousse’s reason vanishing last glass wine.
 
“well, then, say, instance,” resumed danglars, “that if
 voyage dantès just made, touched the
 island elba, someone denounce king’s procureur as

“i will denounce him!” exclaimed young man hastily.
 
“yes, will make sign declaration, confront

 theory, wrote left hand, writing reversed his
 usual style, totally unlike it, following lines, he
 handed fernand, fernand read undertone:
 
“the honorable, king’s attorney, informed friend the

“very good,” resumed danglars; “now revenge looks like common
 sense, way can revert yourself, matter will
 thus work way; nothing now fold letter
 doing, write upon it, ‘to king’s attorney,’ that’s
 settled.” danglars wrote address spoke.
 
“yes, that’s settled!” exclaimed caderousse, who, last
 effort intellect, followed reading letter, and
 instinctively comprehended misery denunciation
 must entail. “yes, that’s settled; will infamous
 shame;” stretched hand reach letter.
 
“yes,” said danglars, taking beyond reach; “and i
 say merely jest, i, amongst first foremost,
 sorry anything happened dantès—the worthy dantès—look
 here!” taking letter, squeezed hands threw
 corner arbor.
 
“all right!” said caderousse. “dantès friend, won’t have

“and thinks using ill? certainly neither fernand,”
 said danglars, rising looking young man, still remained

“in case,” replied caderousse, “let’s wine. wish

“i?” said caderousse, rising offended dignity drunken

“done!” said danglars, “i’ll take bet; tomorrow—today is

“very well, let us go,” said caderousse; “but don’t want arm at

“no,” said fernand; “i shall return catalans.”
 
“you’re wrong. come us marseilles—come along.”
 
“i will not.”
 
“what mean? will not? well, just like, prince;

 fernand stoop, pick crumpled paper, putting his
 pocket rush arbor towards pillon.
 
“well,” said caderousse, “why, lie told! said going

“you don’t mention aided abetted deed,” said
 caderousse.
 
“surely,” answered danglars, “one held responsible every

“you can, indeed, arrow lights point downward somebody’s

“what think you, danglars,” said one party, turning towards him,
 “of event?”
 
“why,” replied he, “i think just possible dantès may been
 detected trifling article board ship considered as
 contraband.”
 
“but done without knowledge, danglars, since
 ship’s supercargo?”
 
“why, that, know told respecting the
 merchandise vessel laden. know loaded with

“there, see,” exclaimed danglars. “now mischief out; depend

mercédès, however, paid heed explanation lover’s

“come, come,” said old man, “be comforted, poor child; is

“hope!” repeated danglars.
 
“hope!” faintly murmured fernand, word seemed die away on

“good news! good news!” shouted forth one party stationed the

“what news?” exclaimed general burst voices.
 
“alas, friends,” replied m. morrel, mournful shake his

“oh, indeed—indeed, sir, innocent!” sobbed forth mercédès.
 
“that believe!” answered m. morrel; “but still charged——”
 
“with what?” inquired elder dantès.
 
“with agent bonapartist faction!” many readers
 may able recollect formidable accusation became in

despairing cry escaped pale lips mercédès; old man sank

“ah, danglars!” whispered caderousse, “you deceived me—the trick

“and reply?”
 
“that certainly think given offence affair

“the hypocrite!” murmured danglars.
 
“poor dantès!” said caderousse. “no one can deny a

“but meanwhile,” continued m. morrel, “here _pharaon_ without a

door met commissary police, waiting him.
 sight officer recalled villefort third heaven to

“we know nothing yet conspiracy, monsieur; papers

 named edmond dantès, mate board three-master _pharaon_,
 trading cotton alexandria smyrna, belonging morrel &
 son, marseilles.”
 
“before entered merchant service, ever served the
 marines?”
 
“oh, no, monsieur, young.”
 
“how old?”
 
“nineteen twenty most.”
 
moment, villefort arrived corner rue
 des conseils, man, seemed waiting him,
 approached; m. morrel.
 
“ah, m. villefort,” cried he, “i delighted see you. of
 people committed strangest mistake—they just
 arrested edmond dantès, mate vessel.”
 
“i know it, monsieur,” replied villefort, “and now going to
 examine him.”
 
“oh,” said morrel, carried away friendship, “you know
 him, do. estimable, trustworthy creature
 world, will venture say, better seaman

 indulgence him.”
 
villefort, seen, belonged aristocratic party at
 marseilles, morrel plebeian; first royalist, other
 suspected bonapartism. villefort looked disdainfully morrel, and
 replied coldly:
 
“you aware, monsieur, man may estimable trustworthy
 private life, best seaman merchant service, yet
 be, politically speaking, great criminal. true?”
 
magistrate laid emphasis words, wished apply
 owner himself, eyes seemed plunge the
 heart one who, interceding another, need of
 indulgence. morrel reddened, conscience quite clear
 politics; besides, dantès told interview with
 grand-marshal, emperor said him, embarrassed
 him. replied, however, tone deep interest:
 
“i entreat you, m. villefort, be, always are, kind and
 equitable, give back us soon.” _give us_ sounded
 revolutionary deputy’s ears.
 
“ah, ah,” murmured he, “is dantès member carbonari
 society, protector thus employs collective form? was,
 recollect, arrested tavern, company great many
 others.” added, “monsieur, may rest assured shall perform

 saying, “bring prisoner.”
 
rapid villefort’s glance, served give idea

 villefort’s first impression favorable; often
 warned mistrust first impulses, applied maxim the

 who, seeming read thoughts others, betrays nothing of

“who you?” demanded villefort, turning pile of
 papers, containing information relative prisoner, police
 agent given entry, that, already, hour’s
 time, swelled voluminous proportions, thanks corrupt
 espionage “the accused” always made victim.
 
“my name edmond dantès,” replied young man calmly; “i mate of

“your age?” continued villefort.
 
“nineteen,” returned dantès.
 
“what moment arrested?”
 
“i festival marriage, monsieur,” said young man,
 voice slightly tremulous, great contrast that
 happy moment painful ceremony now undergoing; great
 contrast sombre aspect m. villefort the
 radiant face mercédès.
 
“you festival marriage?” said deputy,
 shuddering spite himself.
 
“yes, monsieur; point marrying young girl been
 attached three years.” villefort, impassive was, was
 struck coincidence; tremulous voice dantès,
 surprised midst happiness, struck sympathetic chord in
 bosom—he also point married, was
 summoned happiness destroy another. “this
 philosophic reflection,” thought he, “will make great sensation m.
 saint-méran’s;” arranged mentally, dantès awaited

“have served usurper?”
 
“i mustered royal marines fell.”
 
“it reported political opinions extreme,” said villefort,

 inquiry, accusation.
 
“my political opinions!” replied dantès. “alas, sir, never any
 opinions. hardly nineteen; know nothing; part play.

 opinions—i will say public, private—are confined to
 three sentiments,—i love father, respect m. morrel, i
 adore mercédès. this, sir, can tell you, see how
 uninteresting is.” dantès spoke, villefort gazed ingenuous
 open countenance, recollected words renée, who, without
 knowing culprit was, besought indulgence him. with
 deputy’s knowledge crime criminals, every word young man
 uttered convinced innocence. lad, he
 scarcely man,—simple, natural, eloquent eloquence of
 heart never found sought for; full affection everybody,
 happy, happiness renders even wicked
 good—extended affection even judge, spite villefort’s
 severe look stern accent. dantès seemed full kindness.
 
_“pardieu!”_ said villefort, “he noble fellow. hope shall gain
 renée’s favor easily obeying first command ever imposed on
 me. shall least pressure hand public, sweet
 kiss private.” full idea, villefort’s face became joyous,
 turned dantès, latter, watched change

“sir,” said villefort, “have enemies, least, know.”
 
“i enemies?” replied dantès; “my position sufficiently
 elevated that. disposition, is, perhaps, somewhat
 hasty; striven repress it. ten twelve
 sailors me, question them, will tell that

“but may excited jealousy. become captain at

“you right; know men better do, say may

“you wrong; always strive see clearly around you. you
 seem worthy young man; will depart strict line duty

“no, monsieur, know writing, yet tolerably
 plain. whoever writes well. fortunate,” added he,
 looking gratefully villefort, “to examined man you;
 envious person real enemy.” rapid glance that
 young man’s eyes shot forth, villefort saw much energy lay hid
 beneath mildness.
 
“now,” said deputy, “answer frankly, prisoner a

 truth accusation contained anonymous letter?”
 villefort threw disdainfully desk letter dantès just

“none all. will tell real facts. swear honor a

“speak, monsieur,” said villefort. then, internally, “if renée could

“oh,” said dantès timidly, “what matter?” villefort made no

“on honor, idea.”
 
“have idea whatever?”
 
“none all.”
 
“that impossible.”
 
“i swear true. tell me, entreat.”

“the château d’if?” cried he, “what going for?”
 
gendarme smiled.
 
“i going imprisoned,” said dantès; “it used
 political prisoners. committed crime. any

“it probable; occasion squeeze hard.”
 
“without inquiry, without formality?”
 
“all formalities gone through; inquiry already

“and so, spite m. villefort’s promises?”

“where prisoner?” said voice.
 
“here,” replied gendarmes.
 
“let follow me; will take cell.”
 
“go!” said gendarmes, thrusting dantès forward.
 
prisoner followed guide, led room almost under
 ground, whose bare reeking walls seemed though impregnated with
 tears; lamp placed stool illumined apartment faintly, and
 showed dantès features conductor, under-jailer,
 ill-clothed, sullen appearance.

“here chamber tonight,” said he. “it late, the
 governor asleep. tomorrow, perhaps, may change you. the

 jailer disappeared, taking lamp closing door,
 leaving stamped upon prisoner’s mind dim reflection the

dantès alone darkness silence—cold shadows he
 felt breathe burning forehead. first dawn day the
 jailer returned, orders leave dantès was. found the
 prisoner position, fixed there, eyes swollen with
 weeping. passed night standing, without sleep. the
 jailer advanced; dantès appeared perceive him. touched on
 shoulder. edmond started.
 
“have slept?” said jailer.
 
“i know,” replied dantès. jailer stared.
 
“are hungry?” continued he.
 
“i know.”
 
“do wish anything?”
 
“i wish see governor.”
 
jailer shrugged shoulders left chamber.
 
dantès followed eyes, stretched forth hands
 towards open door; door closed. emotion burst
 forth; cast ground, weeping bitterly, asking
 crime committed thus punished.
 
day passed thus; scarcely tasted food, walked round and
 round cell like wild beast cage. one thought particular
 tormented him: namely, journey hither sat so
 still, whereas might, dozen times, plunged sea, and,
 thanks powers swimming, famous, gained
 shore, concealed arrival genoese spanish
 vessel, escaped spain italy, mercédès father could
 joined him. fears live—good seamen
 welcome everywhere. spoke italian like tuscan, spanish
 like castilian; free, happy mercédès and
 father, whereas now confined château d’if, that
 impregnable fortress, ignorant future destiny father and
 mercédès; trusted villefort’s promise.
 thought maddening, dantès threw furiously on
 straw. next morning hour, jailer came again.
 
“well,” said jailer, “are reasonable today?” dantès made
 reply.
 
“come, cheer up; anything can you?”
 
“i wish see governor.”
 
“i already told impossible.”
 
“why so?”
 
“because prison rules, prisoners must even ask
 it.”
 
“what allowed, then?”
 
“better fare, pay it, books, leave walk about.”
 
“i want books, satisfied food, care to
 walk about; wish see governor.”
 
“if worry repeating thing, will bring any

“well, then,” said edmond, “if not, shall die hunger—that
 all.”
 
jailer saw tone happy die; every
 prisoner worth ten sous day jailer, replied more
 subdued tone.
 
“what ask impossible; well behaved will
 allowed walk about, day will meet governor, and
 chooses reply, affair.”
 
“but,” asked dantès, “how long shall wait?”
 
“ah, month—six months—a year.”
 
“it long time. wish see once.”
 
“ah,” said jailer, “do always brood impossible, or
 will mad fortnight.”
 
“you think so?”
 
“yes; instance here; always offering million of

“how long left it?”
 
“two years.”
 
“was liberated, then?”
 
“no; put dungeon.”
 
“listen!” said dantès. “i abbé, mad; perhaps shall

 offer.”
 
“what that?”
 
“i offer million, not; will give

“if took them, detected, lose place, is

“well,” said dantès, “mark this; refuse least tell

 enter will dash brains stool.”
 
“threats!” cried jailer, retreating putting the
 defensive; “you certainly going mad. abbé began like you, and
 three days will like him, mad enough tie up; but,
 fortunately, dungeons here.”
 
dantès whirled stool round head.
 
“all right, right,” said jailer; “all right, since will
 so. will send word governor.”
 
“very well,” returned dantès, dropping stool sitting as
 reality mad. jailer went out, returned an
 instant corporal four soldiers.
 
“by governor’s orders,” said he, “conduct prisoner tier

“to dungeon, then,” said corporal.
 
“yes; must put madman madmen.” soldiers seized
 dantès, followed passively.
 
descended fifteen steps, door dungeon opened, and
 thrust in. door closed, dantès advanced with
 outstretched hands touched wall; sat the
 corner eyes became accustomed darkness. jailer was
 right; dantès wanted little utterly mad.

chapter 10. king’s closet tuileries
 
will leave villefort road paris, travelling—thanks to
 trebled fees—with speed, passing two three
 apartments, enter tuileries little room arched
 window, well known favorite closet napoleon
 louis xviii., now louis philippe.
 
there, seated walnut table brought from
 hartwell, which, one fancies uncommon great
 people, particularly attached, king, louis xviii., was
 carelessly listening man fifty fifty-two years age, with
 gray hair, aristocratic bearing, exceedingly gentlemanly attire,
 meanwhile making marginal note volume gryphius’s rather
 inaccurate, much sought-after, edition horace—a work was
 much indebted sagacious observations philosophical
 monarch.
 
“you say, sir——” said king.
 
“that exceedingly disquieted, sire.”
 
“really, vision seven fat kine seven lean
 kine?”
 
“no, sire, betoken us seven years plenty and
 seven years scarcity; king full foresight your
 majesty, scarcity thing feared.”
 
“then scourge afraid, dear blacas?”
 
“sire, every reason believe storm brewing the
 south.”
 
“well, dear duke,” replied louis xviii., “i think wrongly
 informed, know positively that, contrary, fine
 weather direction.” man ability was, louis xviii.
 liked pleasant jest.
 
“sire,” continued m. blacas, “if reassure faithful
 servant, will majesty send languedoc, provence, dauphiné,
 trusty men, will bring back faithful report feeling
 three provinces?”
 
“_canimus surdis_,” replied king, continuing annotations his
 horace.
 
“sire,” replied courtier, laughing, order might seem to
 comprehend quotation, “your majesty may perfectly right in
 relying good feeling france, fear altogether
 wrong dreading desperate attempt.”
 
“by whom?”
 
“by bonaparte, or, least, adherents.”
 
“my dear blacas,” said king, “you alarms prevent from
 working.”
 
“and you, sire, prevent sleeping security.”
 
“wait, dear sir, wait moment; delightful note on
 _pastor quum traheret_—wait, will listen afterwards.”
 
brief pause, louis xviii. wrote, hand as
 small possible, another note margin horace, then
 looking duke air man thinks idea of
 own, commenting upon idea another, said:
 
“go on, dear duke, go on—i listen.”
 
“sire,” said blacas, moment hope sacrificing
 villefort profit, “i compelled tell are
 mere rumors destitute foundation thus disquiet me; a
 serious-minded man, deserving confidence, charged to
 watch south” (the duke hesitated pronounced these
 words), “has arrived post tell great peril threatens
 king, hastened you, sire.”
 
“_mala ducis avi domum_,” continued louis xviii., still annotating.
 
“does majesty wish drop subject?”
 
“by means, dear duke; just stretch hand.”
 
“which?”
 
“whichever please—there left.”
 
“here, sire?”
 
“i tell left, looking right; mean my
 left—yes, there. will find yesterday’s report minister of
 police. m. dandré himself;” m. dandré, announced the
 chamberlain-in-waiting, entered.
 
“come in,” said louis xviii., repressed smile, “come in, baron,
 tell duke know—the latest news m. bonaparte; do
 conceal anything, however serious,—let us see, island elba
 volcano, may expect issuing thence flaming and
 bristling war—_bella, horrida bella_.”
 
m. dandré leaned respectfully back chair two
 hands, said:
 
“has majesty perused yesterday’s report?”
 
“yes, yes; tell duke himself, find anything, what
 report contains—give particulars usurper is
 islet.”
 
“monsieur,” said baron duke, “all servants his
 majesty must approve latest intelligence the
 island elba. bonaparte——”
 
m. dandré looked louis xviii., who, employed writing note, did
 even raise head. “bonaparte,” continued baron, “is mortally
 wearied, passes whole days watching miners work at
 porto-longone.”
 
“and scratches amusement,” added king.
 
“scratches himself?” inquired duke, “what majesty mean?”
 
“yes, indeed, dear duke. forget great man, this
 hero, demigod, attacked malady skin worries
 death, _prurigo_?”
 
“and, moreover, dear duke,” continued minister police, “we
 almost assured that, short time, usurper will be
 insane.”
 
“insane?”
 
“raving mad; head becomes weaker. sometimes weeps bitterly,
 sometimes laughs boisterously, time passes hours the
 seashore, flinging stones water flint makes
 ‘duck-and-drake’ five six times, appears delighted he
 gained another marengo austerlitz. now, must agree that
 indubitable symptoms insanity.”
 
“or wisdom, dear baron—or wisdom,” said louis xviii.,
 laughing; “the greatest captains antiquity amused by

 africanus.”
 
m. blacas pondered deeply confident monarch the
 truthful minister. villefort, choose reveal whole
 secret, lest another reap benefit disclosure, had
 yet communicated enough cause greatest uneasiness.
 
“well, well, dandré,” said louis xviii., “blacas yet convinced;
 let us proceed, therefore, usurper’s conversion.” minister
 police bowed.
 
“the usurper’s conversion!” murmured duke, looking king and
 dandré, spoke alternately, like virgil’s shepherds. “the usurper
 converted!”
 
“decidedly, dear duke.”
 
“in way converted?”
 
“to good principles. tell it, baron.”
 
“why, way it,” said minister, gravest air

 old veterans expressed desire return france, gave their
 dismissal, exhorted ‘serve good king.’ his

“well, blacas, think this?” inquired king triumphantly,
 pausing moment voluminous scholiast him.
 
“i say, sire, minister police greatly deceived am;

 error. however, sire, might advise, majesty will
 interrogate person spoke you, will urge your

“most willingly, duke; auspices will receive person

 report recent this, dated 20th february, this
 3rd march?”
 
“no, sire, hourly expecting one; may arrived since i
 left office.”
 
“go thither, none—well, well,” continued louis xviii.,
 “make one; usual way, not?” king laughed
 facetiously.
 
“oh, sire,” replied minister, “we occasion invent any;
 every day desks loaded circumstantial denunciations,
 coming hosts people hope return services which
 seek render, cannot; trust fortune, rely upon
 unexpected event way justify predictions.”
 
“well, sir, go,” said louis xviii., “and remember waiting for

“i will go return, sire; shall back ten minutes.”
 
“and i, sire,” said m. blacas, “will go find messenger.”
 
“wait, sir, wait,” said louis xviii. “really, m. blacas, must

“admirable, sire; messenger like stag refer to, for

“no; strongly recommends m. villefort, begs present

“m. villefort!” cried king, “is messenger’s name m. de

“yes, sire.”
 
“and comes marseilles?”
 
“in person.”
 
“why mention name once?” replied king, betraying
 uneasiness.
 
“sire, thought name unknown majesty.”
 
“no, no, blacas; man strong elevated understanding,

“his father?”
 
“yes, noirtier.”

“sire, fatality!” murmured minister, feeling the
 pressure circumstances, however light thing destiny, too
 much human strength endure.
 
“what enemies say us true. learnt nothing,

 myself; midst persons elevated places

“’tis well,” resumed king. “and now, gentlemen,” continued,

“do mention reports, duke, me, know now confidence to

“the affair rue saint-jacques!” exclaimed villefort, unable to
 repress exclamation. then, suddenly pausing, added, “your pardon,

“go on, go on, sir,” replied king; “you today earned right

“sire,” interposed minister police, “i came moment ago give

“on contrary, sir,—on contrary,” said louis xviii., “this
 affair seems decided connection which
 occupies attention, death general quesnel will, perhaps,

“everything points conclusion, sire,” said minister of
 police, “that death result suicide, first

“they track man appointed meeting him.”
 
“on track?” said villefort.
 
“yes, servant given description. man fifty

“how strange,” continued king, asperity; “the police

“never mind, sir, will forget you; make mind easy. the

“i better that, sir—i save you.”
 
“you do? why, really, thing becomes dramatic—explain

“i must refer club rue saint-jacques.”
 
“it appears club rather bore police. didn’t

“they found; track.”
 
“yes, usual phrase; quite familiar it. the

“i understand you.”
 
“you rely usurper’s return?”
 
“we do.”

“eh? thing simple enough. power the

“devotion!” said villefort, sneer.
 
“yes, devotion; is, believe, phrase hopeful

villefort’s father extended hand bell-rope, summon

“wait, dear father,” said young man, “one word more.”
 
“say on.”

“what that?”

“dark complexion; hair, eyebrows, whiskers black; blue frock-coat,

“ah, ha, that’s it, it?” said noirtier; “and why, then, they

“because yesterday, day before, lost sight the

“didn’t say police good nothing?”

“oh, rely me,” said villefort.
 
“yes, yes; now believe right, really

louis xviii. made faint attempt parry unexpected blow;
 monarchy scarcely reconstructed tottered precarious

 therefore, gained nothing save king’s gratitude (which rather

“there can doubt it,” thought he; “it prisoner who

“nobody.”
 
“somebody received packet, gave letter place of

“yes; grand marshal did.”
 
“and letter?”
 
“put portfolio.”
 
“you portfolio you, then? now, sailor find

“you right; left board.”
 
“then till return ship put letter

“no.”
 
“and letter returning from

“i carried hand.”
 
“so went board _pharaon_, everybody see that
 held letter hand?”
 
“yes.”
 
“danglars, well rest?”
 
“danglars, well others.”
 
“now, listen me, try recall every circumstance attending your
 arrest. recollect words information you
 formulated?”
 
“oh yes, read three times, words sank deeply my
 memory.”
 
“repeat me.”
 
dantès paused moment, said, “this it, word word: ‘the

abbé shrugged shoulders. “the thing clear day,” said he;
 “and must confiding nature, well good
 heart, suspected origin whole affair.”
 
“do really think so? ah, indeed infamous.”
 
“how danglars usually write?”
 
“in handsome, running hand.”
 
“and anonymous letter written?”
 
“backhanded.”
 
abbé smiled. “disguised.”
 
“it boldly written, disguised.”
 
“stop bit,” said abbé, taking called pen, and,
 dipping ink, wrote piece prepared linen,

 dantès drew back, gazed abbé sensation almost
 amounting terror.
 
“how astonishing!” cried length. “why writing exactly
 resembles accusation.”
 
“simply accusation written left hand;
 noticed that——”
 
“what?”
 
“that writing different persons done right hand
 varies, performed left hand invariably uniform.”
 
“you evidently seen observed everything.”
 
“let us proceed.”
 
“oh, yes, yes!”
 
“now regards second question.”
 
“i listening.”
 
“was person whose interest prevent marriage

“yes; young man loved her.”
 
“and name was——”
 
“fernand.”
 
“that spanish name, think?”
 
“he catalan.”
 
“you imagine capable writing letter?”
 
“oh, no; likely got rid sticking knife
 me.”
 
“that strict accordance spanish character; an
 assassination will unhesitatingly commit, act cowardice,
 never.”
 
“besides,” said dantès, “the various circumstances mentioned the
 letter wholly unknown him.”
 
“you never spoken anyone?”
 
“to one.”
 
“not even mistress?”
 
“no, even betrothed.”
 
“then danglars.”
 
“i feel quite sure now.”
 
“wait little. pray, danglars acquainted fernand?”
 
“no—yes, was. now recollect——”
 
“what?”
 
“to seen sitting table together arbor at
 père pamphile’s evening day fixed wedding. they
 earnest conversation. danglars joking friendly way,
 fernand looked pale agitated.”
 
“were alone?”
 
“there third person knew perfectly well, who

 caderousse, drunk. stay!—stay!—how strange it
 occurred before! now remember quite well, that
 table round sitting pens, ink, paper.
 oh, heartless, treacherous scoundrels!” exclaimed dantès, pressing
 hand throbbing brows.
 
“is anything else can assist discovering, besides the
 villany friends?” inquired abbé laugh.
 
“yes, yes,” replied dantès eagerly; “i beg you, see so
 completely depths things, greatest mystery
 seems easy riddle, explain underwent
 second examination, never brought trial, and, all, was
 condemned without ever sentence passed me?”
 
“that altogether different serious matter,” responded the
 abbé. “the ways justice frequently dark mysterious be
 easily penetrated. hitherto done matter been
 child’s play. wish enter upon difficult part of
 business, must assist minute information on
 every point.”
 
“pray ask whatever questions please; for, good truth, see
 clearly life myself.”
 
“in first place, then, examined you,—the king’s attorney, his
 deputy, magistrate?”
 
“the deputy.”
 
“was young old?”
 
“about six seven-and-twenty years age, say.”
 
“so,” answered abbé. “old enough ambitious, young to
 corrupt. treat you?”
 
“with mildness severity.”
 
“did tell whole story?”
 
“i did.”
 
“and conduct change course examination?”
 
“he appear much disturbed read letter brought

“by misfortune?”
 
“yes.”
 
“then feel quite sure misfortune deplored?”
 
“he gave one great proof sympathy, rate.”
 
“and that?”
 
“he burnt sole evidence criminated me.”
 
“what? accusation?”
 
“no; letter.”
 
“are sure?”
 
“i saw done.”
 
“that alters case. man might, all, greater
 scoundrel thought possible.”
 
“upon word,” said dantès, “you make shudder. world filled

“yes; remember two-legged tigers crocodiles more
 dangerous others.”
 
“never mind; let us go on.”
 
“with heart! tell burned letter?”
 
“he did; saying time, ‘you see thus destroy only
 proof existing you.’”
 
“this action somewhat sublime natural.”
 
“you think so?”
 
“i sure it. letter addressed?”
 
“to m. noirtier, rue coq-héron, no. 13, paris.”
 
“now can conceive interest heroic deputy could
 possibly destruction letter?”
 
“why, altogether impossible might had, made me
 promise several times never speak letter anyone, assuring
 advised interest; and, this, he
 insisted taking solemn oath never utter name mentioned

“noirtier!” repeated abbé; “noirtier!—i knew person name
 court queen etruria,—a noirtier, a
 girondin revolution! deputy called?”
 
“de villefort!” abbé burst fit laughter, dantès
 gazed utter astonishment.
 
“what ails you?” said length.
 
“do see ray sunlight?”
 
“i do.”
 
“well, whole thing clear sunbeam you.
 poor fellow! poor young man! tell magistrate expressed
 great sympathy commiseration you?”
 
“he did.”
 
“and worthy man destroyed compromising letter?”
 
“yes.”
 
“and made swear never utter name noirtier?”
 
“yes.”
 
“why, poor short-sighted simpleton, can guess this
 noirtier was, whose name careful keep concealed? this
 noirtier father!”
 
thunderbolt fallen feet dantès, hell opened its
 yawning gulf him, completely
 transfixed horror sound unexpected
 words. starting up, clasped hands around head though to
 prevent brain bursting, exclaimed, “his father! his
 father!”
 
“yes, father,” replied abbé; “his right name noirtier de
 villefort.”
 
instant bright light shot mind dantès, and
 cleared dark obscure before. change that
 come villefort examination, destruction the
 letter, exacted promise, almost supplicating tones the
 magistrate, seemed rather implore mercy pronounce
 punishment,—all returned stunning force memory. cried
 out, staggered wall like drunken man, hurried
 opening led abbé’s cell own, said, “i
 must alone, think this.”
 
regained dungeon, threw bed, the
 turnkey found evening visit, sitting fixed gaze and
 contracted features, dumb motionless statue. these
 hours profound meditation, seemed minutes, he
 formed fearful resolution, bound fulfilment by
 solemn oath.
 
dantès length roused reverie voice faria,
 who, also visited jailer, come invite his
 fellow-sufferer share supper. reputation his
 mind, though harmlessly even amusingly so, procured the
 abbé unusual privileges. supplied bread finer, whiter
 quality usual prison fare, even regaled sunday a
 small quantity wine. now sunday, abbé come to
 ask young companion share luxuries him.
 
dantès followed him; features longer contracted, now
 wore usual expression, whole appearance
 bespoke one come fixed desperate resolve. faria
 bent penetrating eye.
 
“i regret now,” said he, “having helped late inquiries, or
 given information did.”
 
“why so?” inquired dantès.
 
“because instilled new passion heart—that of
 vengeance.”
 
dantès smiled. “let us talk something else,” said he.
 
abbé looked him, mournfully shook head; in
 accordance dantès’ request, began speak matters.

“you must teach small part know,” said dantès, “if

 another word escaping.”
 
abbé smiled.
 
“alas, boy,” said he, “human knowledge confined within very
 narrow limits; taught mathematics, physics,
 history, three four modern languages am
 acquainted, will know much myself. now, will scarcely
 require two years communicate stock learning i
 possess.”
 
“two years!” exclaimed dantès; “do really believe can acquire all
 things short time?”
 
“not application, certainly, principles may; to
 learn know; learners learned. memory
 makes one, philosophy other.”
 
“but one learn philosophy?”
 
“philosophy taught; application sciences to
 truth; like golden cloud messiah went into
 heaven.”
 
“well, then,” said dantès, “what shall teach first? a
 hurry begin. want learn.”
 
“everything,” said abbé. evening prisoners
 sketched plan education, entered upon following day.
 dantès possessed prodigious memory, combined astonishing
 quickness readiness conception; mathematical turn his
 mind rendered apt kinds calculation, naturally
 poetical feelings threw light pleasing veil dry reality

 already knew italian, also picked little romaic
 dialect voyages east; aid two

 end six months began speak spanish, english, and
 german.
 
strict accordance promise made abbé, dantès spoke no

 room thoughts; perhaps recollection pledged

 way possibilities flight. days, even months, passed by
 unheeded one rapid instructive course. end year
 dantès new man. dantès observed, however, faria, spite of
 relief society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed

 long reveries, sigh heavily involuntarily, suddenly rise,
 and, folded arms, begin pacing confined space dungeon.
 one day stopped once, exclaimed:
 
“ah, sentinel!”
 
“there shall one minute longer please,” said dantès,
 followed working thoughts accurately though

“i already told you,” answered abbé, “that loathe idea

“and yet murder, choose call so, simply a
 measure self-preservation.”
 
“no matter! never agree it.”
 
“still, thought it?”
 
“incessantly, alas!” cried abbé.
 
“and discovered means regaining freedom, you
 not?” asked dantès eagerly.
 
“i have; possible place deaf blind sentinel in
 gallery beyond us.”
 
“he shall blind deaf,” replied young man, air
 determination made companion shudder.
 
“no, no,” cried abbé; “impossible!”
 
dantès endeavored renew subject; abbé shook head in
 token disapproval, refused make response. three
 months passed away.
 
“are strong?” abbé asked one day dantès. young man, in
 reply, took chisel, bent form horseshoe, and
 readily straightened it.
 
“and will engage harm sentry, except last
 resort?”
 
“i promise honor.”
 
“then,” said abbé, “we may hope put design execution.”
 
“and long shall accomplishing necessary work?”
 
“at least year.”
 
“and shall begin once?”
 
“at once.”
 
“we lost year purpose!” cried dantès.
 
“do consider last twelve months wasted?” asked the
 abbé.
 
“forgive me!” cried edmond, blushing deeply.
 
“tut, tut!” answered abbé, “man man all, are
 best specimen genus ever known. come, let me
 show plan.”
 
abbé showed dantès sketch made escape. it

dantès’ eyes sparkled joy, rubbed hands delight at

 continuing instruct dantès conversing him, sometimes one
 language, sometimes another; others, relating history

 trodden path glory. abbé man world, had,
 moreover, mixed first society day; wore air of
 melancholy dignity dantès, thanks imitative powers

 dantès occupied arranging piece wood heard
 faria, remained edmond’s cell purpose cutting a
 peg secure rope-ladder, call tone indicative of
 great suffering. dantès hastened dungeon, found him
 standing middle room, pale death, forehead
 streaming perspiration, hands clenched tightly together.
 
“gracious heavens!” exclaimed dantès, “what matter? has
 happened?”
 
“quick! quick!” returned abbé, “listen say.”
 
dantès looked fear wonder livid countenance faria,
 whose eyes, already dull sunken, surrounded purple circles,
 lips white corpse, hair
 seemed stand end.
 
“tell me, beseech you, ails you?” cried dantès, letting his
 chisel fall floor.
 
“alas,” faltered abbé, “all me. seized a

 frustrated hopes, dantès lose presence mind, but
 descended passage, dragging unfortunate companion with
 him; then, half-carrying, half-supporting him, managed reach the
 abbé’s chamber, immediately laid sufferer bed.
 
“thanks,” said poor abbé, shivering though veins filled

“perhaps!” exclaimed dantès grief-stricken tones.
 
“help! help!” cried abbé, “i—i—die—i——”

sudden violent fit unfortunate prisoner was
 unable complete sentence; violent convulsion shook whole
 frame, eyes started sockets, mouth drawn one
 side, cheeks became purple, struggled, foamed, dashed himself
 about, uttered dreadful cries, which, however, dantès
 prevented heard covering head blanket. the
 fit lasted two hours; then, helpless infant, colder
 paler marble, crushed broken reed trampled
 foot, fell back, doubled one last convulsion, became
 rigid corpse.
 
edmond waited till life seemed extinct body friend, then,
 taking knife, difficulty forced open closely fixed
 jaws, carefully administered appointed number drops, and
 anxiously awaited result. hour passed away old man gave
 sign returning animation. dantès began fear delayed too
 long ere administered remedy, and, thrusting hands his
 hair, continued gazing lifeless features friend. at
 length slight color tinged livid cheeks, consciousness returned
 dull, open eyeballs, faint sigh issued lips, the
 sufferer made feeble effort move.
 
“he saved! saved!” cried dantès paroxysm delight.
 
sick man yet able speak, pointed evident
 anxiety towards door. dantès listened, plainly distinguished
 approaching steps jailer. therefore near seven
 o’clock; edmond’s anxiety put thoughts time his
 head.
 
young man sprang entrance, darted it, carefully
 drawing stone opening, hurried cell. had
 scarcely done door opened, jailer saw the
 prisoner seated usual side bed. almost key
 turned lock, departing steps jailer
 died away long corridor traverse, dantès, whose
 restless anxiety concerning friend left desire touch the
 food brought him, hurried back abbé’s chamber, raising the
 stone pressing head it, soon beside sick man’s
 couch. faria now fully regained consciousness, still lay
 helpless exhausted miserable bed.
 
“i expect see again,” said feebly, dantès.
 
“and not?” asked young man. “did fancy dying?”
 
“no, idea; but, knowing ready flight, i
 thought might made escape.”
 
deep glow indignation suffused cheeks dantès.
 
“without you? really think capable that?”
 
“at least,” said abbé, “i now see wrong opinion would
 been. alas, alas! fearfully exhausted debilitated this
 attack.”
 
“be good cheer,” replied dantès; “your strength will return.” as
 spoke seated near bed beside faria, took his
 hands. abbé shook head.
 
“the last attack had,” said he, “lasted half hour, after
 hungry, got without help; now can move neither my
 right arm leg, head seems uncomfortable, shows that
 suffusion blood brain. third attack will
 either carry off, leave paralyzed life.”
 
“no, no,” cried dantès; “you mistaken—you will die! your
 third attack (if, indeed, another) will find at
 liberty. shall save another time, done this, only
 better chance success, shall able command
 every requisite assistance.”
 
“my good edmond,” answered abbé, “be deceived. attack which
 just passed away, condemns forever walls prison.
 none can fly dungeon walk.”
 
“well, will wait,—a week, month, two months, need be,—and
 meanwhile strength will return. everything readiness our
 flight, can select time choose. soon feel able

“i shall never swim again,” replied faria. “this arm paralyzed; not
 time, forever. lift it, judge mistaken.”
 
young man raised arm, fell back weight,
 perfectly inanimate helpless. sigh escaped him.
 
“you convinced now, edmond, not?” asked abbé. “depend
 upon it, know say. since first attack experienced of
 malady, continually reflected it. indeed, expected it,
 family inheritance; father grandfather died of
 third attack. physician prepared remedy i
 twice successfully taken, celebrated
 cabanis, predicted similar end me.”
 
0233m
 


“the physician may mistaken!” exclaimed dantès. “and your
 poor arm, difference will make? can take my
 shoulders, swim us.”
 
“my son,” said abbé, “you, sailor swimmer, must
 know well man loaded sink done
 fifty strokes. cease, then, allow duped vain
 hopes, even excellent heart refuses believe in. i
 shall remain till hour deliverance arrives, that, all
 human probability, will hour death. you, are
 young active, delay account, fly—go—i give back
 promise.”
 
“it well,” said dantès. “then shall also remain.” then, rising and
 extending hand air solemnity old man’s head, he
 slowly added, “by blood christ swear never leave while
 live.”
 
faria gazed fondly noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled
 young friend, read countenance ample confirmation the
 sincerity devotion loyalty purpose.
 
“thanks,” murmured invalid, extending one hand. “i accept. may

dantès took hand abbé his, affectionately pressed it.
 faria smiled encouragingly him, young man retired his
 task, spirit obedience respect sworn show
 towards aged friend.
 


chapter 18. treasure
 
dantès returned next morning chamber companion in
 captivity, found faria seated looking composed. ray of
 light entered narrow window cell, held open in
 left hand, alone, will recollected, retained the
 use, sheet paper, which, constantly rolled small
 compass, form cylinder, easily kept open. he
 speak, showed paper dantès.
 
“what that?” inquired.
 
“look it,” said abbé smile.
 
“i looked possible attention,” said dantès, “and i
 see half-burnt paper, traces gothic characters
 inscribed peculiar kind ink.”
 
“this paper, friend,” said faria, “i may now avow you, since i
 proof fidelity—this paper treasure, which,
 day forth, one-half belongs you.”
 
sweat started forth dantès’ brow. day how
 long time!—he refrained talking treasure, had
 brought upon abbé accusation madness. instinctive
 delicacy edmond preferred avoiding touch painful chord,
 faria equally silent. taken silence old
 man return reason; now words uttered faria,
 painful crisis, seemed indicate serious relapse into
 mental alienation.
 
“your treasure?” stammered dantès. faria smiled.
 
“yes,” said he. “you have, indeed, noble nature, edmond, see by
 paleness agitation passing heart this
 moment. no, assured, mad. treasure exists, dantès, and
 allowed possess it, will. yes—you. one
 listen believe me, everyone thought mad; you,
 must know not, listen me, believe afterwards
 will.”
 
“alas,” murmured edmond himself, “this terrible relapse! there
 blow wanting.” said aloud, “my dear friend, your
 attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; better repose awhile?
 tomorrow, will, will hear narrative; today wish to
 nurse carefully. besides,” said, “a treasure thing we
 need hurry about.”
 
“on contrary, matter utmost importance, edmond!”
 replied old man. “who knows tomorrow, next day after, the
 third attack may come on? must over? yes,
 indeed, often thought bitter joy riches, which
 make wealth dozen families, will forever lost to
 men persecute me. idea one vengeance me, i
 tasted slowly night dungeon despair my

 see you, young promising future,—now think of

 shudder delay, tremble lest assure one as
 worthy possession vast amount hidden

edmond turned away head sigh.
 
“you persist incredulity, edmond,” continued faria. “my words
 convinced you. see require proofs. well, then, read this
 paper, never shown anyone.”
 
“tomorrow, dear friend,” said edmond, desirous yielding to
 old man’s madness. “i thought understood not
 talk tomorrow.”
 
“then will talk tomorrow; read paper
 today.”
 
“i will irritate him,” thought edmond, taking paper, of
 half wanting,—having burnt, doubt, some
 accident,—he read:
 
“this treasure, may amount two...

“25th april, 149’”
 

“well!” said faria, young man finished reading it.
 
“why,” replied dantès, “i see nothing broken lines unconnected
 words, rendered illegible fire.”
 
“yes, you, friend, read first time; for
 me, grown pale many nights’ study, have
 reconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.”
 
“and believe discovered hidden meaning?”
 
“i sure have, shall judge yourself; first listen
 history paper.”
 
“silence!” exclaimed dantès. “steps approach—i go—adieu!”
 
dantès, happy escape history explanation be
 sure confirm belief friend’s mental instability, glided
 like snake along narrow passage; faria, restored his
 alarm certain amount activity, pushed stone place with
 foot, covered mat order effectually to
 avoid discovery.

faria sat receive him, avoiding gestures order he
 might conceal governor paralysis already half
 stricken death. fear lest governor, touched with
 pity, might order removed better quarters, thus
 separate young companion. fortunately the
 case, governor left him, convinced poor madman, for
 heart felt kind affection, troubled a
 slight indisposition.
 
time, edmond, seated bed head hands,
 tried collect scattered thoughts. faria, since first
 acquaintance, points rational logical, so
 wonderfully sagacious, fact, understand so
 much wisdom points allied madness. faria
 deceived treasure, world deceived faria?
 
dantès remained cell day, daring return his
 friend, thinking thus defer moment convinced,
 all, abbé mad—such conviction so
 terrible!
 
but, towards evening hour customary visit had
 gone by, faria, seeing young man appear, tried move get
 distance separated them. edmond shuddered heard
 painful efforts old man made drag along; his
 leg inert, longer make use one arm. edmond was
 obliged assist him, otherwise able to
 enter small aperture led dantès’ chamber.
 
“here am, pursuing remorselessly,” said benignant
 smile. “you thought escape munificence, vain. listen
 me.”
 
edmond saw escape, placing old man bed, he
 seated stool beside him.
 
“you know,” said abbé, “that secretary intimate

“and say treasure amounts to——”
 
“two millions roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions money.”2
 
“impossible!” said dantès, staggered enormous amount.
 
“impossible? why?” asked old man. “the spada family one of
 oldest powerful families fifteenth century; in

now treasure, long object abbé’s
 meditations, insure future happiness faria really
 loved son, doubled value eyes, every day he
 expatiated amount, explaining dantès good which, with
 thirteen fourteen millions francs, man days
 friends; dantès’ countenance became gloomy, the
 oath vengeance taken recurred memory, reflected
 much ill, times, man thirteen fourteen millions
 enemies.
 
abbé know island monte cristo; dantès knew it,
 often passed it, situated twenty-five miles pianosa,
 corsica island elba, touched there.
 island was, always been, still is, completely deserted. it
 rock almost conical form, looks though been
 thrust volcanic force depth surface ocean.
 dantès drew plan island faria, faria gave dantès
 advice means employ recover treasure. but
 dantès far enthusiastic confident old man.
 past question now faria lunatic, way in
 achieved discovery, given rise the
 suspicion madness, increased edmond’s admiration him; at
 time dantès believe deposit, supposing it
 ever existed, still existed; though considered treasure
 means chimerical, yet believed longer there.
 
however, fate resolved depriving prisoners last
 chance, making understand condemned to
 perpetual imprisonment, new misfortune befell them; gallery on
 side, long ruins, rebuilt. had
 repaired completely, stopped vast masses stone the
 hole dantès partly filled in. precaution, which, it
 will remembered, abbé made edmond, misfortune would
 still greater, attempt escape been
 detected, undoubtedly separated. thus new, a
 stronger, inexorable barrier interposed cut the
 realization hopes.
 
“you see,” said young man, air sorrowful resignation, to
 faria, “that god deems right take claim merit for
 call devotion you. promised remain forever
 you, now break promise would. treasure
 will mine yours, neither us will quit this
 prison. real treasure that, dear friend, awaits

 implanted memory, taken root with
 philological ramifications. different sciences you
 made easy depth knowledge possess of

 made rich happy. believe me, take comfort, better
 tons gold cases diamonds, even as
 problematical clouds see morning floating the

 just point yielding knew you, no

 actual. owe real good, present happiness; the
 sovereigns earth, even cæsar borgia himself, deprive
 this.”
 
thus, actually happy, yet days two unfortunates passed
 together went quickly. faria, long time kept silence
 treasure, now perpetually talked it. prophesied
 case, remained paralyzed right arm left
 leg, given hope ever enjoying himself. was
 continually thinking means escape young companion,
 anticipating pleasure enjoy. fear letter might
 day lost stolen, compelled dantès learn heart;
 dantès knew first last word. destroyed
 second portion, assured first seized, one would
 able discover real meaning. whole hours sometimes passed
 faria giving instructions dantès,—instructions were

 hour moment so, one thought,
 was, gain monte cristo means, remain alone

 endeavor find wonderful caverns, search appointed
 spot,—the appointed spot, remembered, farthest angle in

meanwhile hours passed, rapidly, least tolerably.
 faria, said, without recovered use hand
 foot, regained clearness understanding, had
 gradually, besides moral instructions detailed, taught his
 youthful companion patient sublime duty prisoner, who
 learns make something nothing. thus perpetually
 employed,—faria, might see grow old; dantès, for
 fear recalling almost extinct past now floated his
 memory like distant light wandering night. life went for
 victims misfortune whose
 activities glide along mechanically tranquilly beneath eye of
 providence.
 
beneath superficial calm heart young
 man, perhaps old man, many repressed desires, many
 stifled sighs, found vent faria left alone, when
 edmond returned cell.
 
one night edmond awoke suddenly, believing heard someone
 calling him. opened eyes upon utter darkness. name, or
 rather plaintive voice essayed pronounce name, reached
 him. sat bed cold sweat broke upon brow.
 undoubtedly call came faria’s dungeon.
 
“alas,” murmured edmond; “can be?”
 
moved bed, drew stone, rushed passage, and
 reached opposite extremity; secret entrance open. the
 light wretched wavering lamp, spoken,
 dantès saw old man, pale, yet erect, clinging bedstead.
 features writhing horrible symptoms he
 already knew, seriously alarmed saw them
 first time.
 
“alas, dear friend,” said faria resigned tone, “you understand,
 not, need attempt explain you?”
 
edmond uttered cry agony, and, quite senses, rushed
 towards door, exclaiming, “help, help!”
 
faria just sufficient strength restrain him.
 
“silence,” said, “or lost. must now think you, my
 dear friend, act render captivity supportable your
 flight possible. require years done
 here, results instantly destroyed jailers knew
 communicated other. besides, assured, dear
 edmond, dungeon leave will long remain empty;
 unfortunate will soon take place, you
 will appear like angel salvation. perhaps will young,
 strong, enduring, like yourself, will aid escape,
 hindrance. will longer half dead
 body tied drag movements. length providence
 done something you; restores takes away,
 time die.”
 
edmond clasp hands exclaim, “oh, friend, my
 friend, speak thus!” resuming presence mind,
 moment staggered blow, strength,
 failed words old man, said, “oh, have
 saved once, will save second time!” raising the
 foot bed, drew phial, still third filled the
 red liquor.
 
“see,” exclaimed, “there remains still magic draught.
 quick, quick! tell must time; fresh
 instructions? speak, friend; listen.”
 
“there hope,” replied faria, shaking head, “but matter;
 god wills man created, whose heart so
 profoundly rooted love life, power to
 preserve existence, which, however painful may be, yet
 always dear.”
 
“oh, yes, yes!” exclaimed dantès; “and tell will save you
 yet.”
 
“well, then, try. cold gains upon me. feel blood flowing
 towards brain. horrible chills, make teeth chatter
 seem dislocate bones, begin pervade whole frame; in
 five minutes malady will reach height, quarter an
 hour will nothing left corpse.”
 
“oh!” exclaimed dantès, heart wrung anguish.
 
“do before, wait long, springs of
 life now exhausted me, death,” continued, looking his
 paralyzed arm leg, “has half work do. if, having
 made swallow twelve drops instead ten, see not
 recover, pour rest throat. now lift bed, for
 can longer support myself.”
 
edmond took old man arms, laid bed.
 
“and now, dear friend,” said faria, “sole consolation wretched
 existence,—you heaven gave somewhat late, still gave me, a
 priceless gift, grateful,—at moment of
 separating forever, wish happiness the
 prosperity well deserve. son, bless thee!”
 
young man cast knees, leaning head the
 old man’s bed.
 
“listen, now, say dying moment. treasure of
 spadas exists. god grants boon vision unrestricted by
 time space. see depths inner cavern. eyes
 pierce inmost recesses earth, dazzled sight
 much riches. escape, remember poor abbé, whom
 world called mad, so. hasten monte cristo—avail
 fortune—for indeed suffered long enough.”
 
violent convulsion attacked old man. dantès raised head and
 saw faria’s eyes injected blood. seemed flow blood
 ascended chest head.
 
“adieu, adieu!” murmured old man, clasping edmond’s hand
 convulsively—“adieu!”
 
“oh, no,—no, yet,” cried; “do forsake me! oh, succor him!
 help—help—help!”
 
“hush! hush!” murmured dying man, “that may separate us if
 save me!”
 
“you right. oh, yes, yes; assured shall save you! besides,
 although suffer much, seem agony you
 before.”
 
“do mistake! suffer less less strength to
 endure. age faith life; privilege youth
 believe hope, old men see death clearly. oh, ’tis
 here—’tis here—’tis over—my sight gone—my senses fail! hand,
 dantès! adieu! adieu!”
 
raising final effort, summoned his
 faculties, said,—“monte cristo, forget monte cristo!” he
 fell back bed.
 
crisis terrible, rigid form twisted limbs, swollen
 eyelids, lips flecked bloody foam, lay bed torture,
 place intellectual lately rested there.
 
dantès took lamp, placed projecting stone bed,
 whence tremulous light fell strange fantastic ray the
 distorted countenance motionless, stiffened body. steady gaze
 awaited confidently moment administering restorative.
 
believed right moment arrived, took knife,
 pried open teeth, offered less resistance before,
 counted one twelve drops, watched; phial
 contained, perhaps, twice much more. waited ten minutes, a
 quarter hour, half hour,—no change took place. trembling, his
 hair erect, brow bathed perspiration, counted seconds
 beating heart. thought time make the
 last trial, put phial purple lips faria, and
 without occasion force open jaws, remained
 extended, poured whole liquid throat.

draught produced galvanic effect, violent trembling pervaded
 old man’s limbs, eyes opened fearful gaze upon
 them, heaved sigh resembled shriek, convulsed
 body returned gradually former immobility, eyes remaining
 open.
 
half hour, hour, hour half elapsed, this
 period anguish, edmond leaned friend, hand applied to
 heart, felt body gradually grow cold, heart’s
 pulsation become deep dull, length it
 stopped; last movement heart ceased, face became livid,
 eyes remained open, eyeballs glazed.
 
six o’clock morning, dawn just breaking, its
 feeble ray came dungeon, paled ineffectual light of
 lamp. strange shadows passed countenance dead man,
 times gave appearance life. struggle between

 gained pre-eminence, saw alone corpse. then
 invincible extreme terror seized upon him, dared not

 returned subterraneous gallery, arrived time hear the
 exclamations turnkey, called help. turnkeys

 came governor.
 
edmond heard creaking bed moved corpse, heard
 voice governor, asked throw water dead
 man’s face; seeing that, spite application, prisoner
 recover, sent doctor. governor went out,
 words pity fell dantès’ listening ears, mingled brutal
 laughter.
 
“well, well,” said one, “the madman gone look his

“with millions, will enough pay shroud!”
 said another.
 
“oh,” added third voice, “the shrouds château d’if not

“they may give honors sack.”
 
edmond lose word, comprehended little was
 said. voices soon ceased, seemed everyone had
 left cell. still dared enter, might left
 turnkey watch dead. remained, therefore, mute and
 motionless, hardly venturing breathe. end hour, he
 heard faint noise, increased. governor returned,
 followed doctor attendants. moment’s
 silence,—it evident doctor examining dead body.
 inquiries soon commenced.
 
doctor analyzed symptoms malady prisoner
 succumbed, declared dead. questions answers
 followed nonchalant manner made dantès indignant, felt
 world poor abbé love respect

“i sorry tell me,” said governor, replying to
 assurance doctor, “that old man really dead; he
 quiet, inoffensive prisoner, happy folly, required no
 watching.”
 
“ah,” added turnkey, “there occasion watching him; he
 stayed fifty years, i’ll answer it, without any
 attempt escape.”
 
“still,” said governor, “i believe will requisite,
 notwithstanding certainty, doubt science, but
 discharge official duty, perfectly assured

moment complete silence, dantès, still
 listening, knew doctor examining corpse second time.
 
“you may make mind easy,” said doctor; “he dead. will
 answer that.”
 
“you know, sir,” said governor, persisting, “that not
 content cases simple examination. spite
 appearances, kind, therefore, finish duty by
 fulfilling formalities described law.”
 
“let irons heated,” said doctor; “but really useless
 precaution.”
 
order heat irons made dantès shudder. heard hasty steps,
 creaking door, people going coming, minutes
 afterwards turnkey entered, saying:
 
“here brazier, lighted.”
 
moment’s silence, heard crackling of
 burning flesh, peculiar nauseous smell penetrated even
 behind wall dantès listening horror. perspiration
 poured forth upon young man’s brow, felt should
 faint.
 
“you see, sir, really dead,” said doctor; “this burn the
 heel decisive. poor fool cured folly, delivered

“wasn’t name faria?” inquired one officers accompanied
 governor.

“yes, sir; and, said, ancient name. was, too, very

“it sort malady call monomania,” said doctor.
 
“you never anything complain of?” said governor the
 jailer charge abbé.
 
“never, sir,” replied jailer, “never; contrary, sometimes
 amused much telling stories. one day, too, wife

“ah, ah!” said doctor, “i know rival; i

“yes, yes, make mind easy, shall decently interred the

“must last formality take place presence, sir?” inquired a
 turnkey.
 
“certainly. make haste—i stay day.” other
 footsteps, going coming, now heard, moment afterwards
 noise rustling canvas reached dantès’ ears, bed creaked, and
 heavy footfall man lifts weight sounded floor;
 bed creaked weight deposited upon it.
 
“this evening,” said governor.
 
“will mass?” asked one attendants.
 
“that impossible,” replied governor. “the chaplain the
 château came yesterday beg leave absence, order to

“pooh, pooh;” said doctor, impiety usual persons his

“this evening,” said governor, task ended.
 
“at hour?” inquired turnkey.
 
“why, ten eleven o’clock.”
 
“shall watch corpse?”
 
“of use be? shut dungeon alive—that is

steps retreated, voices died away distance; the
 noise door, creaking hinges bolts ceased, a
 silence sombre solitude ensued,—the silence death,
 all-pervasive, struck icy chill soul of

 faria’s fate better, all—to solve problem life at

idea suicide, friend driven away kept away by
 cheerful presence, now hovered like phantom abbé’s dead

“if die,” said, “i go goes, should

excessive grief like storm sea, frail bark is

“should better grottos?”
 
“what grottos?”
 
“why, grottos—caves island.”
 
“i know grottos,” replied jacopo.
 
cold sweat sprang forth dantès’ brow.
 
“what, grottos monte cristo?” asked.
 
“none.”
 
moment dantès speechless; remembered caves
 might filled accident, even stopped up, the
 sake greater security, cardinal spada. point was, then, to
 discover hidden entrance. useless search night, and
 dantès therefore delayed investigation morning. besides,
 signal made half league sea, _la jeune amélie_
 replied similar signal, indicated moment business had
 come.
 
boat now arrived, assured answering signal was
 well, soon came sight, white silent phantom, cast
 anchor within cable’s length shore.
 
landing began. dantès reflected, worked, shout of
 joy which, single word, evoke men, he
 gave utterance one unchanging thought pervaded heart;
 but, far disclosing precious secret, almost feared he
 already said much, restlessness continual
 questions, minute observations evident preoccupation, aroused
 suspicions. fortunately, regarded circumstance least, his
 painful past gave countenance indelible sadness, the
 glimmerings gayety seen beneath cloud indeed but
 transitory.
 
one slightest suspicion; next day, taking a
 fowling-piece, powder, shot, dantès declared intention go
 kill wild goats seen springing rock to
 rock, wish construed love sport, desire for
 solitude. however, jacopo insisted following him, dantès not
 oppose this, fearing might incur distrust.
 scarcely, however, gone quarter league when, having
 killed kid, begged jacopo take comrades, request
 cook it, ready let know firing gun. this

 fare.
 
dantès went on, looking time time behind around him.
 reached summit rock, saw, thousand feet beneath
 him, companions, jacopo rejoined, busy
 preparing repast edmond’s skill marksman augmented
 capital dish.
 
edmond looked moment sad gentle smile a
 man superior fellows.
 
“in two hours’ time,” said he, “these persons will depart richer by
 fifty piastres each, go risk lives endeavoring to
 gain fifty more; will return fortune six hundred
 francs, waste treasure city pride sultans
 insolence nabobs. moment hope makes despise their
 riches, seem contemptible. yet perchance tomorrow deception
 will act me, shall, compulsion, consider a
 contemptible possession utmost happiness. oh, no!” exclaimed
 edmond, “that will be. wise, unerring faria be
 mistaken one thing. besides, better die to
 continue lead low wretched life.”
 
thus dantès, three months desire liberty had
 now liberty enough, panted wealth. cause in
 dantès, providence, who, limiting power man, has
 filled boundless desires.
 
meanwhile, cleft two walls rock, following path worn
 torrent, which, human probability, human foot never
 trod, dantès approached spot supposed grottos
 must existed. keeping along shore, examining smallest
 object serious attention, thought trace, certain
 rocks, marks made hand man.
 
time, encrusts physical substances mossy mantle, as
 invests things mind forgetfulness, seemed have
 respected signs, apparently made degree
 regularity, probably definite purpose. occasionally the
 marks hidden tufts myrtle, spread large bushes
 laden blossoms, beneath parasitical lichen. edmond to
 separate branches brush away moss know the
 guide-marks were. sight marks renewed edmond fondest hopes.
 might cardinal first traced them,
 order might serve guide nephew event

 complete. solitary place precisely suited requirements

 marks attracted eyes made? and
 dark wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded precious
 secret?

seemed, however, edmond, hidden comrades the
 inequalities ground, sixty paces harbor the
 marks ceased; terminate grotto. large round rock,
 placed solidly base, spot seemed to
 lead. edmond concluded perhaps instead reached end
 route explored beginning, therefore
 turned round retraced steps.
 
meanwhile comrades prepared repast, got water from
 spring, spread fruit bread, cooked kid. just at
 moment taking dainty animal spit, they
 saw edmond springing boldness chamois rock rock,
 fired signal agreed upon. sportsman instantly changed
 direction, ran quickly towards them. even they
 watched daring progress, edmond’s foot slipped, saw him
 stagger edge rock disappear. rushed towards
 him, loved edmond spite superiority; yet jacopo
 reached first.
 
found edmond lying prone, bleeding, almost senseless. had
 rolled declivity twelve fifteen feet. poured little
 rum throat, remedy so
 beneficial him, produced effect formerly. edmond opened
 eyes, complained great pain knee, feeling heaviness
 head, severe pains loins. wished carry to
 shore; touched him, although jacopo’s
 directions, declared, heavy groans, bear to

may supposed dantès now think dinner, he
 insisted comrades, reasons fasting, should
 meal. himself, declared need a
 little rest, returned easier. the
 sailors require much urging. hungry, smell of
 roasted kid savory, tars very
 ceremonious. hour afterwards returned. edmond been
 able drag dozen paces forward lean
 moss-grown rock.
 
but, instead growing easier, dantès’ pains appeared increase in
 violence. old patron, obliged sail morning in
 order land cargo frontiers piedmont france,
 nice fréjus, urged dantès try rise. edmond made
 great exertions order comply; effort fell back,
 moaning turning pale.
 
“he broken ribs,” said commander, low voice. “no
 matter; excellent fellow, must leave him. will
 try carry board tartan.”
 
dantès declared, however, rather die than
 undergo agony slightest movement cost him.
 
“well,” said patron, “let may happen, shall never said
 deserted good comrade like you. will go till evening.”
 
much astonished sailors, although, one opposed it.
 patron strict first time ever
 seen give enterprise, even delay execution. dantès
 allow infraction regular proper rules
 made favor.
 
“no, no,” said patron, “i awkward, just i
 pay penalty clumsiness. leave small supply biscuit, a
 gun, powder, balls, kill kids defend need, and
 pickaxe, may build shelter delay coming back for
 me.”
 
“but you’ll die hunger,” said patron.
 
“i rather so,” edmond’s reply, “than suffer the
 inexpressible agonies slightest movement causes me.”
 
patron turned towards vessel, rolling swell in
 little harbor, and, sails partly set, ready sea
 toilet completed.
 
“what do, maltese?” asked captain. “we leave you
 so, yet stay.”
 
“go, go!” exclaimed dantès.
 
“we shall absent least week,” said patron, “and we
 must run course come take again.”
 
“why,” said dantès, “if two three days hail fishing-boat,
 desire come me. will pay twenty-five piastres my
 passage back leghorn. come across one, return me.”
 patron shook head.
 
“listen, captain baldi; there’s one way settling this,” said jacopo.
 “do go, will stay take care wounded man.”
 
“and give share venture,” said edmond, “to remain with
 me?”
 
“yes,” said jacopo, “and without hesitation.”
 
“you good fellow kind-hearted messmate,” replied edmond,
 “and heaven will recompense generous intentions; do
 wish anyone stay me. day two rest will set up,
 hope shall find among rocks certain herbs excellent
 bruises.”
 
peculiar smile passed dantès’ lips; squeezed jacopo’s hand
 warmly, nothing shake determination remain—and remain
 alone.
 
smugglers left edmond requested set sail, but
 without turning several times, time making signs of
 cordial farewell, edmond replied hand only, if
 move rest body.
 
then, disappeared, said smile,—“’tis strange
 among men find proofs friendship and
 devotion.” dragged cautiously top rock,

“and now,” exclaimed, remembering tale arabian fisherman,

 thousands grasshoppers, hidden bushes, chirped a
 monotonous dull note; leaves myrtle olive trees

felt indescribable sensation somewhat akin dread—that dread of

 gun, mounted summit highest rock, thence gazed
 round every direction.
 
upon corsica, houses could
 distinguish; sardinia; island elba, its
 historical associations; upon almost imperceptible line to
 experienced eye sailor alone revealed coast genoa the
 proud, leghorn commercial, gazed. the
 brigantine left morning, tartan just
 set sail, edmond fixed eyes.
 
first just disappearing straits bonifacio; other,
 following opposite direction, round island of

sight reassured him. looked objects near him. he
 saw highest point island,—a statue this
 vast pedestal granite, nothing human appearing sight, the
 blue ocean beat base island, covered a
 fringe foam. descended cautious slow step, he
 dreaded lest accident similar adroitly feigned
 happen reality.
 
dantès, said, traced marks along rocks, he
 noticed led small creek, hidden like the
 bath ancient nymph. creek sufficiently wide its
 mouth, deep centre, admit entrance small
 vessel lugger class, perfectly concealed from
 observation.
 
following clew that, hands abbé faria, been
 skilfully used guide dædalian labyrinth of
 probabilities, thought cardinal spada, anxious be
 watched, entered creek, concealed little barque, followed
 line marked notches rock, end had
 buried treasure. idea brought dantès back to
 circular rock. one thing perplexed edmond, destroyed his
 theory. rock, weighed several tons, been
 lifted spot, without aid many men?
 
suddenly idea flashed across mind. instead raising it,
 thought he, lowered it. sprang rock order
 inspect base formerly stood.
 
soon perceived slope formed, rock slid
 along stopped spot now occupied. large stone
 served wedge; flints pebbles inserted around it,
 conceal orifice; species masonry covered
 earth, grass weeds grown there, moss clung the
 stones, myrtle-bushes taken root, old rock seemed fixed to
 earth.

dantès dug away earth carefully, detected, fancied he
 detected, ingenious artifice. attacked wall, cemented by
 hand time, pickaxe. ten minutes’ labor wall
 gave way, hole large enough insert arm opened.
 
dantès went cut strongest olive-tree find, stripped
 branches, inserted hole, used lever. but
 rock heavy, firmly wedged, moved anyone
 man, hercules himself. dantès saw must attack the
 wedge. how?
 
cast eyes around, saw horn full powder his
 friend jacopo left him. smiled; infernal invention would
 serve purpose.
 
aid pickaxe, dantès, manner labor-saving
 pioneer, dug mine upper rock one supported
 it, filled powder, made match rolling his
 handkerchief saltpetre. lighted retired.
 
explosion soon followed; upper rock lifted base by
 terrific force powder; lower one flew pieces;
 thousands insects escaped aperture dantès previously
 formed, huge snake, like guardian demon treasure,
 rolled along darkening coils, disappeared.
 
dantès approached upper rock, now, without support,
 leaned towards sea. intrepid treasure-seeker walked round it,
 and, selecting spot whence appeared susceptible to
 attack, placed lever one crevices, strained every
 nerve move mass.
 
rock, already shaken explosion, tottered base. dantès
 redoubled efforts; seemed like one ancient titans, who
 uprooted mountains hurl father gods. rock
 yielded, rolled over, bounded point point, finally
 disappeared ocean.
 
spot occupied circular space, exposing iron ring
 let square flag-stone.
 
dantès uttered cry joy surprise; never first attempt
 crowned perfect success. fain continued,
 knees trembled, heart beat violently, sight
 became dim, forced pause.
 
feeling lasted moment. edmond inserted lever the
 ring exerted strength; flag-stone yielded, and
 disclosed steps descended lost obscurity of
 subterraneous grotto.
 
anyone else rushed cry joy. dantès turned pale,
 hesitated, reflected.
 
“come,” said himself, “be man. accustomed adversity. i
 must cast discovery deceived. what,
 then, use suffered? heart breaks when,
 elated flattering hopes, sees illusions
 destroyed. faria dreamed this; cardinal spada buried no
 treasure here; perhaps never came here, did, cæsar borgia,
 intrepid adventurer, stealthy indefatigable plunderer, has
 followed him, discovered traces, pursued done,
 raised stone, descending me, left nothing.”
 
remained motionless pensive, eyes fixed gloomy
 aperture open feet.
 
“now expect nothing, now longer entertain the

“yes, yes; adventure worthy place varied career of

“but fate guards thus possessed secret?”
 asked dantès himself.
 
“the fate,” replied he, smiling, “of buried alaric, were
 interred corpse.”
 
“yet, come,” thought dantès, “he found treasure,
 borgia, compared italy artichoke, could
 devour leaf leaf, knew well value time waste in
 replacing rock. will go down.”
 
descended, smile lips, murmuring last word of
 human philosophy, “perhaps!”
 
instead darkness, thick mephitic atmosphere he
 expected find, dantès saw dim bluish light, which, well
 air, entered, merely aperture just formed, but
 interstices crevices rock visible from
 without, distinguish blue sky the
 waving branches evergreen oaks, tendrils creepers

stood minutes cavern, atmosphere which
 rather warm damp, dantès’ eye, habituated to
 darkness, pierce even remotest angles cavern, which
 granite sparkled like diamonds.
 
“alas,” said edmond, smiling, “these treasures cardinal has
 left; good abbé, seeing dream glittering walls, has
 indulged fallacious hopes.”
 
called mind words will, knew heart.
 “in farthest angle second opening,” said cardinal’s
 will. found first grotto; now seek the
 second. dantès continued search. reflected second
 grotto must penetrate deeper island; examined stones,
 sounded one part wall fancied opening existed,
 masked precaution’s sake.
 
pickaxe struck moment dull sound drew of
 dantès’ forehead large drops perspiration. last seemed him
 one part wall gave forth hollow deeper echo; he
 eagerly advanced, quickness perception one but

however, he, like cæsar borgia, knew value time; and, order
 avoid fruitless toil, sounded walls his

 excuse, desire assured one watching him, in
 reality felt faint.
 
island deserted, sun seemed cover fiery
 glance; afar off, small fishing boats studded bosom the
 blue ocean.
 
dantès tasted nothing, thought hunger a
 moment; hastily swallowed drops rum, entered the
 cavern.
 
pickaxe seemed heavy, now like feather his
 grasp; seized it, attacked wall. several blows he
 perceived stones cemented, merely placed
 one upon other, covered stucco; inserted point of
 pickaxe, using handle lever, joy soon saw the
 stone turn hinges, fall feet.

arrived leghorn, repaired house jew, dealer in

mournful answer awaited edmond’s eager inquiries the
 information jacopo obtained. old dantès dead, mercédès had

dantès listened melancholy tidings outward calmness; but,
 leaping lightly ashore, signified desire quite alone. a
 couple hours returned. two men jacopo’s boat came on

 steered direct marseilles. father’s death was

“ah, sir,” said caderousse sigh, “it easy perceive am

“yes, honest—i can certainly say much myself,” continued the
 innkeeper, fairly sustaining scrutiny abbé’s gaze; “i can
 boast truth honest man; and,” continued he
 significantly, hand breast shaking head, “that is

“so much better you, assert true,” said the
 abbé; “for firmly persuaded that, sooner later, good will

“such words belong profession,” answered caderousse,
 “and well repeat them; but,” added he, bitter
 expression countenance, “one free believe not, one

“you wrong speak thus,” said abbé; “and perhaps may, my
 person, able prove completely error.”
 
“what mean you?” inquired caderousse look surprise.
 
“in first place, must satisfied person am

“what proofs require?”
 
“did you, year 1814 1815, know anything young sailor
 named dantès?”
 
“dantès? know poor dear edmond? why, edmond dantès myself
 intimate friends!” exclaimed caderousse, whose countenance flushed
 darkly caught penetrating gaze abbé fixed him,
 clear, calm eye questioner seemed dilate with
 feverish scrutiny.
 
“you remind me,” said priest, “that young man concerning i

“said bear name!” repeated caderousse, becoming excited and
 eager. “why, called truly bore appellation

“he died wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner the

“poor fellow, poor fellow!” murmured caderousse. “well, there, sir, is
 another proof good people never rewarded earth, and
 none wicked prosper. ah,” continued caderousse, speaking
 highly colored language south, “the world grows worse and
 worse. god, really hates wicked, said
 do, send brimstone fire, consume altogether?”
 
“you speak though loved young dantès,” observed the
 abbé, without taking notice companion’s vehemence.
 
“and did,” replied caderousse; “though once, confess, envied
 good fortune. swear you, sir, swear you, by
 everything man holds dear, have, since then, deeply sincerely
 lamented unhappy fate.”
 
brief silence, fixed, searching eye the
 abbé employed scrutinizing agitated features the
 innkeeper.
 
“you knew poor lad, then?” continued caderousse.
 
“i called see dying bed, might administer to
 consolations religion.”
 
“and die?” asked caderousse choking voice.
 
“of what, think you, young strong men die prison, they
 scarcely numbered thirtieth year, unless of

“but strangest part story is,” resumed abbé, “that

“and was,” murmured caderousse. “how been

“and reason, besought try clear mystery he
 never able penetrate, clear memory any

look abbé, becoming fixed, seemed to
 rest ill-concealed satisfaction gloomy depression was
 rapidly spreading countenance caderousse.
 
“a rich englishman,” continued abbé, “who companion in
 misfortune, released prison second
 restoration, possessed diamond immense value; jewel he
 bestowed dantès upon quitting prison, mark his
 gratitude kindness brotherly care dantès had
 nursed severe illness underwent confinement.
 instead employing diamond attempting bribe jailers,
 might taken betrayed governor,
 dantès carefully preserved it, event getting of
 prison might wherewithal live, sale a
 diamond quite sufficed make fortune.”
 
“then, suppose,” asked caderousse, eager, glowing looks, “that
 stone immense value?”
 
“why, everything relative,” answered abbé. “to one edmond’s
 position diamond certainly great value. estimated at
 fifty thousand francs.”
 
“bless me!” exclaimed caderousse, “fifty thousand francs! surely the
 diamond large nut worth that.”
 
“no,” replied abbé, “it size that; you
 shall judge yourself. me.”
 
sharp gaze caderousse instantly directed towards the
 priest’s garments, though hoping discover location the
 treasure. calmly drawing forth pocket small box covered with
 black shagreen, abbé opened it, displayed dazzled eyes
 caderousse sparkling jewel contained, set ring of
 admirable workmanship.
 
“and diamond,” cried caderousse, almost breathless eager
 admiration, “you say, worth fifty thousand francs?”
 
“it is, without setting, also valuable,” replied abbé,
 closed box, returned pocket, its
 brilliant hues seemed still dance eyes fascinated
 innkeeper.
 
“but comes diamond possession, sir? edmond make you
 heir?”
 
“no, merely testamentary executor. ‘i possessed four dear and
 faithful friends, besides maiden betrothed’ said;
 ‘and feel convinced unfeignedly grieved loss.
 name one four friends caderousse.’” innkeeper
 shivered.
 
“‘another number,’” continued abbé, without seeming to
 notice emotion caderousse, “‘is called danglars; third,
 spite rival, entertained sincere affection for
 me.’”
 
fiendish smile played features caderousse, about
 break upon abbé’s speech, latter, waving hand,
 said, “allow finish first, observations
 make, can afterwards. ‘the third friends, although
 rival, much attached me,—his name fernand; my
 betrothed was’—stay, stay,” continued abbé, “i forgotten what
 called her.”
 
“mercédès,” said caderousse eagerly.
 
“true,” said abbé, stifled sigh, “mercédès was.”
 
“go on,” urged caderousse.
 
“bring _carafe_ water,” said abbé.
 
caderousse quickly performed stranger’s bidding; pouring
 glass, slowly swallowing contents, abbé,
 resuming usual placidity manner, said, placed empty
 glass table:
 
“where leave off?”
 
“the name edmond’s betrothed mercédès.”
 
“to sure. ‘you will go marseilles,’ said dantès,—for you
 understand, repeat words just uttered them. you
 understand?”
 
“perfectly.”
 
“‘you will sell diamond; will divide money five equal
 parts, give equal portion good friends, only
 persons loved upon earth.’”
 
“but five parts?” asked caderousse; “you mentioned four
 persons.”
 
“because fifth dead, hear. fifth sharer edmond’s
 bequest, father.”
 
“too true, true!” ejaculated caderousse, almost suffocated the
 contending passions assailed him, “the poor old man die.”
 
“i learned much marseilles,” replied abbé, making strong
 effort appear indifferent; “but length time has
 elapsed since death elder dantès, unable obtain any
 particulars end. can enlighten point?”
 
“i know not,” said caderousse. “why, i
 lived almost floor poor old man. ah, yes, a
 year disappearance poor old man died.”
 
“of die?”
 
“why, doctors called complaint gastro-enteritis, believe; his
 acquaintances say died grief; i, saw dying
 moments, say died of——”
 
caderousse paused.
 
“of what?” asked priest, anxiously eagerly.
 
“why, downright starvation.”
 
“starvation!” exclaimed abbé, springing seat. “why, the
 vilest animals suffered die death that. the
 dogs wander houseless homeless streets find some
 pitying hand cast mouthful bread; man, a
 christian, allowed perish hunger midst other
 men call christians, horrible belief. oh, it
 impossible!—utterly impossible!”
 
“what said, said,” answered caderousse.
 
“and fool said anything it,” said voice
 top stairs. “why meddle not
 concern you?”
 
two men turned quickly, saw sickly countenance la
 carconte peering baluster rails; attracted sound of
 voices, feebly dragged stairs, and, seated on
 lower step, head knees, listened foregoing
 conversation.
 
“mind business, wife,” replied caderousse sharply. “this
 gentleman asks information, common politeness will not
 permit refuse.”
 
“politeness, simpleton!” retorted carconte. “what do
 politeness, like know? better study little common
 prudence. know motives person may trying
 extract can you?”
 
“i pledge word, madam,” said abbé, “that intentions are
 good; husband can incur risk, provided answers me
 candidly.”
 
“ah, that’s fine,” retorted woman. “nothing easier than
 begin fair promises assurances nothing fear; when
 poor, silly folks, like husband there, persuaded tell
 know, promises assurances safety quickly
 forgotten; moment nobody expecting it, behold
 trouble misery, sorts persecutions, heaped the
 unfortunate wretches, even see whence afflictions
 come.”
 
“nay, nay, good woman, make perfectly easy, beg you.
 whatever evils may befall you, will occasioned my
 instrumentality, solemnly promise you.”
 
carconte muttered inarticulate words, let head again
 drop upon knees, went fit ague, leaving two
 speakers resume conversation, remaining able to
 hear every word uttered. abbé obliged to
 swallow draught water calm emotions threatened to
 overpower him.
 
sufficiently recovered himself, said, “it appears, then,
 miserable old man telling forsaken by
 everyone. surely, case, have
 perished dreadful death.”
 
“why, altogether forsaken,” continued caderousse, “for
 mercédès catalan monsieur morrel kind him; but
 somehow poor old man contracted profound hatred for
 fernand—the person,” added caderousse bitter smile, “that
 named just now one dantès’ faithful attached
 friends.”
 
“and so?” asked abbé.
 
“gaspard, gaspard!” murmured woman, seat stairs,
 “mind saying!”
 
caderousse made reply words, though evidently irritated and
 annoyed interruption, but, addressing abbé, said, “can man
 faithful another whose wife covets desires himself?
 dantès honorable true nature, he
 believed everybody’s professions friendship. poor edmond, was
 cruelly deceived; fortunate never knew, might
 found difficult, deathbed, pardon his
 enemies. and, whatever people may say,” continued caderousse, his
 native language, altogether devoid rude poetry, “i
 help frightened idea malediction the
 dead hatred living.”
 
“imbecile!” exclaimed carconte.
 
“do you, then, know manner fernand injured dantès?” inquired
 abbé caderousse.
 
“do i? one better.”
 
“speak then, say was!”
 
“gaspard!” cried carconte, “do will; master—but if
 take advice you’ll hold tongue.”
 
“well, wife,” replied caderousse, “i don’t know you’re right!”
 
“so will say nothing?” asked abbé.
 
“why, good do?” asked caderousse. “if poor lad were
 living, came begged candidly tell were
 true false friends, why, perhaps, not
 hesitate. tell more, therefore can nothing
 hatred revenge, let feeling buried with
 him.”
 
“you prefer, then,” said abbé, “that bestow men say
 false treacherous, reward intended faithful
 friendship?”
 
“that true enough,” returned caderousse. “you say truly, gift of
 poor edmond meant traitors fernand danglars;
 besides, them? drop water the
 ocean.”
 
“remember,” chimed carconte, “those two crush a
 single blow!”
 
“how so?” inquired abbé. “are persons, then, rich and
 powerful?”
 
“do know history?”
 
“i not. pray relate me!”
 
caderousse seemed reflect moments, said, “no, truly,

“well, good friend,” returned abbé, tone indicated
 utter indifference part, “you liberty, either speak or
 silent, just please; part, respect scruples

 conscientiously can, fulfil promise dying man. my
 first business will dispose diamond.”
 
saying, abbé drew small box pocket, opened
 it, contrived hold light, bright flash of
 brilliant hues passed dazzled gaze caderousse.
 
“wife, wife!” cried hoarse voice, “come here!”
 
“diamond!” exclaimed carconte, rising descending chamber
 tolerably firm step; “what diamond talking about?”
 
“why, hear said?” inquired caderousse. “it a
 beautiful diamond left poor edmond dantès, sold, money
 divided father, mercédès, betrothed bride, fernand,
 danglars, myself. jewel worth least fifty thousand
 francs.”
 
“oh, magnificent jewel!” cried astonished woman.
 
“the fifth part profits stone belongs us then, does
 not?” asked caderousse.
 
“it does,” replied abbé; “with addition equal division of
 part intended elder dantès, believe at
 liberty divide equally four survivors.”
 
“and among us four?” inquired caderousse.
 
“as friends edmond esteemed faithful devoted to
 him.”
 
“i don’t call friends betray ruin you,” murmured wife

“of course not!” rejoined caderousse quickly; “no i, that

“remember,” answered abbé calmly, replaced jewel its

“two men jealous him, sir; one love, from

“’twas so, then—’twas so, then,” murmured abbé. “oh, faria, faria,
 well judge men things!”
 
“what please say, sir?” asked caderousse.
 
“nothing, nothing,” replied priest; “go on.”
 
“it danglars wrote denunciation left hand, that
 writing might recognized, fernand put the

“but,” exclaimed abbé suddenly, “you yourself.”
 
“i!” said caderousse, astonished; “who told there?”
 
abbé saw overshot mark, added quickly,—“no one;
 order known everything well, must an
 eye-witness.”
 
“true, true!” said caderousse choking voice, “i there.”
 
“and remonstrate infamy?” asked abbé; “if

“sir,” replied caderousse, “they made drink excess
 nearly lost perception. indistinct
 understanding passing around me. said man in

 carrying on, perfectly harmless.”
 
“next day—next day, sir, must seen plain enough had

“yes, sir, there, anxious speak; danglars
 restrained me. ‘if really guilty,’ said he, ‘and did

“i understand—you allowed matters take course, all.”
 
“yes, sir,” answered caderousse; “and remorse preys night and
 day. often ask pardon god, swear you, action,

 life, doubt cause abject condition. expiating a
 moment selfishness, always say carconte, she
 complains, ‘hold tongue, woman; will god.’” and
 caderousse bowed head every sign real repentance.
 
“well, sir,” said abbé, “you spoken unreservedly; thus to
 accuse deserve pardon.”
 
“unfortunately, edmond dead, pardoned me.”
 
“he know,” said abbé.
 
“but knows now,” interrupted caderousse; “they say dead
 know everything.”
 
brief silence; abbé rose paced down
 pensively, resumed seat.
 
“you two three times mentioned m. morrel,” said; “who was
 he?”
 
“the owner _pharaon_ patron dantès.”
 
“and part play sad drama?” inquired abbé.
 
“the part honest man, full courage real regard. twenty

“and,” asked abbé, “is m. morrel still alive?”
 
“yes,” replied caderousse.
 
“in case,” replied abbé, “he man blessed god,
 rich, happy.”
 
caderousse smiled bitterly. “yes, happy myself,” said he.
 
“what! m. morrel unhappy?” exclaimed abbé.
 
“he reduced almost last extremity—nay, almost the
 point dishonor.”
 
“how?”
 
“yes,” continued caderousse, “so is; five-and-twenty years of

“and unfortunate man wife children?” inquired abbé.
 
“yes, wife, everything behaved like angel;
 daughter, marry man loved, whose
 family now will allow wed daughter ruined man; he
 has, besides, son, lieutenant army; and, may suppose,
 this, instead lessening, augments sorrows. were
 alone world blow brains, an

“horrible!” ejaculated priest.
 
“and thus heaven recompenses virtue, sir,” added caderousse. “you
 see, i, never bad action told of—am in
 destitution, poor wife dying fever eyes, and
 unable anything world her; shall die hunger, as
 old dantès did, fernand danglars rolling wealth.”
 
“how that?”
 
“because deeds brought good fortune, honest men
 reduced misery.”
 
“what become danglars, instigator, therefore most
 guilty?”
 
“what become him? why, left marseilles, taken, the

“fernand? why, much story.”

“and staggered everybody. must life some

 ledger, arose, offered seat stranger; seen
 seated, resumed chair. fourteen years changed the
 worthy merchant, who, thirty-sixth year opening this
 history, now fiftieth; hair turned white, time and
 sorrow ploughed deep furrows brow, look, so
 firm penetrating, now irresolute wandering, feared

englishman looked air curiosity, evidently
 mingled interest. “monsieur,” said morrel, whose uneasiness was
 increased examination, “you wish speak me?”
 
“yes, monsieur; aware come?”
 
“the house thomson & french; least, cashier tells me.”
 
“he told rightly. house thomson & french 300,000 or
 400,000 francs pay month france; and, knowing strict
 punctuality, collected bills bearing signature, and
 charged became due present them, employ money
 otherwise.”
 
morrel sighed deeply, passed hand forehead, was
 covered perspiration.
 
“so then, sir,” said morrel, “you hold bills mine?”
 
“yes, considerable sum.”
 
“what amount?” asked morrel voice strove render

“here is,” said englishman, taking quantity papers his
 pocket, “an assignment 200,000 francs house m. boville,
 inspector prisons, due. acknowledge, of
 course, owe sum him?”
 
“yes; placed money hands four half per cent
 nearly five years ago.”
 
“when pay?”
 
“half 15th month, half 15th next.”
 
“just so; now 32,500 francs payable shortly; all
 signed you, assigned house holders.”
 
“i recognize them,” said morrel, whose face suffused, thought
 that, first time life, unable honor his
 signature. “is all?”
 
“no, end month bills been
 assigned us house pascal, house wild & turner
 marseilles, amounting nearly 55,000 francs; all, 287,500
 francs.”
 
impossible describe morrel suffered this
 enumeration. “two hundred eighty-seven thousand five hundred
 francs,” repeated he.
 
“yes, sir,” replied englishman. “i will not,” continued he, a
 moment’s silence, “conceal you, probity and
 exactitude moment universally acknowledged, yet the
 report current marseilles able meet your
 liabilities.”
 
almost brutal speech morrel turned deathly pale.
 
“sir,” said he, “up time—and now than
 four-and-twenty years since received direction house from
 father, conducted five-and-thirty years—never
 anything bearing signature morrel & dishonored.”
 
“i know that,” replied englishman. “but man honor should
 answer another, tell fairly, shall pay same
 punctuality?”
 
morrel shuddered, looked man, spoke assurance
 hitherto shown.
 
“to questions frankly put,” said he, “a straightforward answer should
 given. yes, shall pay, if, hope, vessel arrives safely;
 arrival will procure credit numerous
 accidents, victim, deprived me; if
 _pharaon_ lost, last resource gone——”
 
poor man’s eyes filled tears.
 
“well,” said other, “if last resource fail you?”
 
“well,” returned morrel, “it cruel thing forced say, but,
 already used misfortune, must habituate shame. fear i
 shall forced suspend payment.”
 
“have friends assist you?”
 
morrel smiled mournfully.
 
“in business, sir,” said he, “one friends, correspondents.”
 
“it true,” murmured englishman; “then one hope.”
 
“but one.”
 
“the last?”
 
“the last.”
 
“so fail——”
 
“i ruined,—completely ruined!”
 
“as way here, vessel coming port.”
 
“i know it, sir; young man, still adheres fallen fortunes,
 passes part time belvedere top house, in
 hopes first announce good news me; informed
 arrival ship.”
 
“and yours?”
 
“no, bordeaux vessel, _la gironde_; comes india also;
 mine.”
 
“perhaps spoken _pharaon_, brings tidings
 her?”
 
“shall tell plainly one thing, sir? dread almost much to
 receive tidings vessel remain doubt. uncertainty is
 still hope.” low voice morrel added,—“this delay not
 natural. _pharaon_ left calcutta 5th february; to
 month ago.”
 
“what that?” said englishman. “what meaning that
 noise?”
 
“oh, god!” cried morrel, turning pale, “what it?”
 
loud noise heard stairs people moving hastily, and
 half-stifled sobs. morrel rose advanced door; his
 strength failed sank chair. two men remained
 opposite one another, morrel trembling every limb, stranger
 gazing air profound pity. noise ceased; but
 seemed morrel expected something—something occasioned the
 noise, something must follow. stranger fancied heard
 footsteps stairs; footsteps, of
 several persons, stopped door. key inserted lock of
 first door, creaking hinges audible.
 
“there two persons key door,” murmured
 morrel, “cocles julie.”
 
instant second door opened, young girl, eyes
 bathed tears, appeared. morrel rose tremblingly, supporting
 arm chair. spoken, voice
 failed him.
 
“oh, father!” said she, clasping hands, “forgive child for
 bearer evil tidings.”
 
morrel changed color. julie threw arms.
 
“oh, father, father!” murmured she, “courage!”
 
“the _pharaon_ gone down, then?” said morrel hoarse voice. the
 young girl speak; made affirmative sign her
 head lay father’s breast.
 
“and crew?” asked morrel.
 
“saved,” said girl; “saved crew vessel just
 entered harbor.”
 
morrel raised two hands heaven expression resignation
 sublime gratitude.
 
“thanks, god,” said he, “at least thou strikest alone.”
 
tear moistened eye phlegmatic englishman.
 
“come in, come in,” said morrel, “for presume the

scarcely uttered words madame morrel entered weeping
 bitterly. emmanuel followed her, antechamber visible

“how happen?” said morrel.
 
“draw nearer, penelon,” said young man, “and tell us it.”
 
old seaman, bronzed tropical sun, advanced, twirling the

“good-day, m. morrel,” said he, just quitted marseilles
 previous evening, just returned aix toulon.
 
“good-day, penelon,” returned morrel, refrain from
 smiling tears, “where captain?”
 
“the captain, m. morrel,—he stayed behind sick palma; please
 god, won’t much, will see days alive and
 hearty.”
 
“well, now tell story, penelon.”

penelon rolled quid cheek, placed hand mouth,
 turned head, sent long jet tobacco-juice the

“you see, m. morrel,” said he, “we somewhere cape blanc

“that enough latitudes,” said englishman; “i

firm, sonorous, unexpected voice made everyone start. penelon
 put hand eyes, stared man thus

“we better that, sir,” said old sailor respectfully; “we
 put helm run tempest; ten minutes struck
 top-sails scudded bare poles.”
 
“the vessel old risk that,” said englishman.
 
“eh, business; pitching heavily for
 twelve hours sprung leak. ‘penelon,’ said captain, ‘i think we

 he.”
 
“well done!” said englishman.

“there’s nothing gives much courage good reasons,” continued
 sailor; “and time wind abated, gone

“well, well,” said m. morrel, “i know one fault but

“oh, don’t let us talk that, m. morrel.”
 
“yes, will talk it.”
 
“well, then, three months,” said penelon.
 
“cocles, pay two hundred francs good fellows,” said
 morrel. “at another time,” added he, “i said, give them,
 besides, two hundred francs present; times changed,

penelon turned companions, exchanged words them.
 
“as that, m. morrel,” said he, turning quid, “as for

“as what?”
 
“the money.”
 
“well——”
 
“well, say fifty francs will enough us present,

“thanks, friends, thanks!” cried morrel gratefully; “take it—take

last words produced prodigious effect seaman. penelon
 nearly swallowed quid; fortunately recovered.
 
“what, m. morrel!” said low voice, “you send us away; are
 angry us!”
 
“no, no,” said m. morrel, “i angry, quite contrary, do
 send away; ships, therefore not
 want sailors.”
 
“no ships!” returned penelon; “well, then, you’ll build some;
 we’ll wait you.”
 
“i money build ships with, penelon,” said poor owner
 mournfully, “so accept kind offer.”
 
“no money? must pay us; can scud, like the
 _pharaon_, bare poles.”
 
“enough, enough!” cried morrel, almost overpowered; “leave me, pray
 you; shall meet happier time. emmanuel, go them, and
 see orders executed.”
 
“at least, shall see again, m. morrel?” asked penelon.

“i see,” returned englishman, “that fresh unmerited

“oh, sir!” cried morrel.

“your bills, least, first will fall due.”
 
“do wish time pay?”
 
“a delay save honor, consequently life.”
 
“how long delay wish for?”

 attribute selfish argument this: “we
 better help man owes us nearly 300,000 francs, those
 300,000 francs end three months hasten ruin, get
 six eight per cent money back again.”
 
unfortunately, whether envy stupidity, morrel’s
 correspondents take view; even came contrary
 decision. bills signed morrel presented office with
 scrupulous exactitude, and, thanks delay granted the
 englishman, paid cocles equal punctuality. cocles thus
 remained accustomed tranquillity. morrel alone who
 remembered alarm, repay 15th 50,000
 francs m. boville, 30th 32,500 francs bills,
 which, well debt due inspector prisons, had

 embarrassed, drew one side corner landing-place,
 passed quid one cheek other, stared stupidly his

 penelon’s embarrassment elegance attire; evident
 good fellow gone expense account; he
 was, doubt, engaged board vessel, thus his
 bashfulness arose fact having, may express
 ourselves, worn mourning _pharaon_ longer. perhaps come

 31st august came, house opened usual, cocles appeared
 behind grating counter, examined bills presented with
 usual scrutiny, and, first last, paid usual
 precision. came in, moreover, two drafts m. morrel had
 fully anticipated, cocles paid punctually bills
 shipowner accepted. incomprehensible, and
 then, tenacity peculiar prophets bad news, failure

 morrel saved. morrel long thought danglars, kept

 returned home crushed humiliation refusal.
 
yet, arrival, morrel utter complaint, say one harsh
 word. embraced weeping wife daughter, pressed emmanuel’s
 hand friendly warmth, going private room the

“then,” said two women emmanuel, “we indeed ruined.”

 unusual precipitation, raised hands heaven and
 exclaimed:
 
“oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle, dreadful misfortune! could
 ever believed it!”
 
moment afterwards julie saw go upstairs carrying two three
 heavy ledgers, portfolio, bag money.
 
morrel examined ledgers, opened portfolio, counted the
 money. funds amounted 6,000 8,000 francs, bills
 receivable 5th 4,000 5,000, which, making best of
 everything, gave 14,000 francs meet debts amounting 287,500

however, morrel went dinner, appeared calm.
 calmness alarming two women deepest
 dejection been. dinner morrel usually went and
 used take coffee club phocéens, read the
 _semaphore_; day leave house, returned his
 office.
 
cocles, seemed completely bewildered. part day he
 went courtyard, seated stone head bare

 left room morrel come them, heard
 pass door, trying conceal noise his
 footsteps. listened; went sleeping-room, fastened
 door inside. madame morrel sent daughter bed, half an

 stealthily along passage, see keyhole her
 husband doing.
 
passage saw retreating shadow; julie, who, uneasy
 herself, anticipated mother. young lady went towards madame
 morrel.
 
“he writing,” said.
 
understood without speaking. madame morrel looked
 keyhole, morrel writing; madame morrel
 remarked, daughter observed, husband was
 writing stamped paper. terrible idea writing his
 will flashed across her; shuddered, yet strength to
 utter word.
 
next day m. morrel seemed calm ever, went office as
 usual, came breakfast punctually, then, dinner, he
 placed daughter beside him, took head arms, held her
 long time bosom. evening, julie told her
 mother, although apparently calm, noticed that
 father’s heart beat violently.
 
next two days passed much way. evening the

“what done wrong, father,” said, “that take this
 key me?”
 
“nothing, dear,” replied unhappy man, tears starting his
 eyes simple question,—“nothing, want it.”
 
julie made pretence feel key. “i must left my
 room,” said.
 
went out, instead going apartment hastened to
 consult emmanuel.
 
“do give key father,” said he, “and tomorrow morning,
 possible, quit moment.”
 
questioned emmanuel, knew nothing, say he
 knew.
 
night, 4th 5th september, madame morrel

“mother,” said young man, looking alternately madame morrel and
 daughter, “what occurred—what happened? letter has
 frightened me, come hither speed.”
 
“julie,” said madame morrel, making sign young man, “go and
 tell father maximilian just arrived.”
 
young lady rushed apartment, first step of

“are mademoiselle julie morrel?” inquired man, a
 strong italian accent.
 
“yes, sir,” replied julie hesitation; “what pleasure? do

 postscript. read:
 
“it important fulfil mission person and

postscript decreased greatly young girl’s happiness. there
 nothing fear? snare laid her? innocence
 kept ignorance dangers might assail young girl

“listen,” said; “today 5th september, not?”
 
“yes.”
 
“today, then, eleven o’clock, father nearly three hundred

“yes, know that.”
 
“well, then,” continued emmanuel, “we fifteen thousand francs

“what will happen then?”
 
“why, today eleven o’clock father found someone
 will come aid, will compelled twelve o’clock to

“oh, come, then, come!” cried she, hastening away young man.

“i have,” replied morrel.
 
“you money coming can rely?”
 
“none.”
 
“you exhausted every resource?”
 
“all.”
 
“and half hour,” said maximilian gloomy voice, “our name is

chapter 31. italy: sinbad sailor
 
towards beginning year 1838, two young men belonging the
 first society paris, viscount albert morcerf baron
 franz d’Épinay, florence. agreed see carnival
 rome year, franz, last three four years
 inhabited italy, act _cicerone_ albert.
 
inconsiderable affair spend carnival rome,
 especially great desire sleep piazza del
 popolo, campo vaccino, wrote signor pastrini, the
 proprietor hôtel londres, piazza di spagna, reserve
 comfortable apartments them. signor pastrini replied had
 two rooms parlor third floor, offered the
 low charge louis per diem. accepted offer; wishing to
 make best use time left, albert started naples.
 franz, remained florence, passed few
 days exploring paradise cascine, spending two or
 three evenings houses florentine nobility, took a
 fancy head (having already visited corsica, cradle of
 bonaparte) visit elba, waiting-place napoleon.
 
one evening cast painter sailboat iron ring
 secured dock leghorn, wrapped coat and
 lay down, said crew,—“to island elba!”
 
boat shot harbor like bird next morning franz
 disembarked porto-ferrajo. traversed island, having
 followed traces footsteps giant left, and
 re-embarked marciana.
 
two hours landed pianosa, assured that
 red partridges abounded. sport bad; franz succeeded in
 killing partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he
 returned boat much temper.
 
“ah, excellency chose,” said captain, “you might have
 capital sport.”
 
“where?”
 
“do see island?” continued captain, pointing conical
 pile rising indigo sea.
 
“well, island?”
 
“the island monte cristo.”
 
“but permission shoot island.”
 
“your excellency require permit, island is
 uninhabited.”
 
“ah, indeed!” said young man. “a desert island midst the
 mediterranean must curiosity.”
 
“it natural; island mass rocks, not
 contain acre land capable cultivation.”
 
“to island belong?”
 
“to tuscany.”
 
“what game shall find there!”
 
“thousands wild goats.”
 
“who live upon stones, suppose,” said franz incredulous
 smile.
 
“no, browsing shrubs trees grow crevices
 rocks.”
 
“where can sleep?”
 
“on shore grottos, board cloak; besides, your
 excellency pleases, can leave soon like—we can sail as
 well night day, wind drops can use oars.”
 
franz sufficient time, apartments rome yet
 available, accepted proposition. upon answer the
 affirmative, sailors exchanged words together low tone.
 “well,” asked he, “what now? difficulty way?”
 
“no.” replied captain, “but must warn excellency the
 island infected port.”
 
“what mean?”
 
“monte cristo although uninhabited, yet serves occasionally refuge
 smugglers pirates come corsica, sardinia, and
 africa, becomes known there, shall have
 perform quarantine six days return leghorn.”
 
“the deuce! puts different face matter. six days! why,
 that’s long almighty took make world! long a
 wait—too long.”
 
“but will say excellency monte cristo?”
 
“oh, shall not,” cried franz.
 
“nor i, i,” chorused sailors.
 
“then steer monte cristo.”
 
captain gave orders, helm put up, boat soon
 sailing direction island. franz waited in
 order, sail filled, four sailors taken
 places—three forward, one helm—he resumed the
 conversation. “gaetano,” said captain, “you tell monte
 cristo serves refuge pirates, are, seems me, very
 different kind game goats.”
 
“yes, excellency, true.”
 
“i knew smugglers, thought since capture of
 algiers, destruction regency, pirates existed in
 romances cooper captain marryat.”
 
“your excellency mistaken; pirates, like bandits who
 believed exterminated pope leo xii., yet,
 every day, rob travellers gates rome. excellency
 heard french _chargé d’affaires_ robbed six months ago
 within five hundred paces velletri?”
 
“oh, yes, heard that.”
 
“well, then, if, like us, excellency lived leghorn, would
 hear, time time, little merchant vessel, english
 yacht expected bastia, porto-ferrajo, civita
 vecchia, arrived; one knows become it, but,
 doubtless, struck rock foundered. now rock has
 met long narrow boat, manned six eight men, who
 surprised plundered it, dark stormy night, near some
 desert gloomy island, bandits plunder carriage recesses
 forest.”
 
“but,” asked franz, lay wrapped cloak bottom the
 boat, “why plundered complain french,
 sardinian, tuscan governments?”
 
“why?” said gaetano smile.
 
“yes, why?”
 
“because, first place, transfer vessel their
 boat whatever think worth taking, bind crew hand
 foot, attach everyone’s neck four-and-twenty-pound ball,
 large hole chopped vessel’s bottom, leave
 her. end ten minutes vessel begins roll heavily and
 settle down. first one gun’l goes under, other. lift
 sink again, go once. there’s noise
 like cannon—that’s air blowing deck. soon water rushes
 scupper-holes like whale spouting, vessel gives last
 groan, spins round round, disappears, forming vast whirlpool
 ocean, over, five minutes nothing but
 eye god can see vessel lies bottom the
 sea. understand now,” said captain, “why complaints are
 made government, vessel never reaches port?”
 
probable gaetano related previous proposing
 expedition, franz hesitated, now had
 started, thought cowardly draw back. one of
 men rashly court danger, danger presents
 itself, combat unalterable coolness. calm and
 resolute, treated peril adversary a
 duel,—calculated probable method approach; retreated, all,
 point strategy cowardice; quick see an
 opening attack, won victory single thrust.
 
“bah!” said he, “i travelled sicily calabria—i have
 sailed two months archipelago, yet never saw even the
 shadow bandit pirate.”
 
“i tell excellency deter project,”
 replied gaetano, “but questioned me, answered; that’s
 all.”
 
“yes, conversation interesting; wish enjoy
 long possible, steer monte cristo.”
 
wind blew strongly, boat made six seven knots hour, and
 rapidly reaching end voyage. drew near
 island seemed lift sea, air clear that
 already distinguish rocks heaped one another, like
 cannon balls arsenal, green bushes trees growing the
 crevices. sailors, although appeared perfectly tranquil
 yet evident alert, carefully
 watched glassy surface sailing, a
 fishing-boats, white sails, alone visible.
 
within fifteen miles monte cristo sun began to
 set behind corsica, whose mountains appeared sky, showing
 rugged peaks bold relief; mass rock, like giant
 adamastor, rose dead ahead, formidable barrier, intercepting the
 light gilded massive peaks voyagers in
 shadow. little little shadow rose higher seemed drive
 last rays expiring day; last reflection
 rested summit mountain, paused instant, like
 fiery crest volcano, gloom gradually covered summit
 covered base, island now appeared a
 gray mountain grew continually darker; half hour after, the
 night quite dark.
 
fortunately, mariners used latitudes, knew every
 rock tuscan archipelago; midst obscurity
 franz without uneasiness—corsica long since disappeared,
 monte cristo invisible; sailors seemed, like the
 lynx, see dark, pilot steered evince the
 slightest hesitation.
 
hour passed since sun set, franz fancied saw, at
 quarter mile left, dark mass, not
 precisely make was, fearing excite mirth the
 sailors mistaking floating cloud land, remained silent;
 suddenly great light appeared strand; land might resemble a
 cloud, fire meteor.
 
“what light?” asked he.
 
“hush!” said captain; “it fire.”
 
“but told island uninhabited?”
 
“i said fixed habitations it, said also it
 served sometimes harbor smugglers.”
 
“and pirates?”
 
“and pirates,” returned gaetano, repeating franz’s words. “it is
 reason given orders pass island, for, you
 see, fire behind us.”
 
“but fire?” continued franz. “it seems rather reassuring
 otherwise; men wish seen light a
 fire.”
 
“oh, goes nothing,” said gaetano. “if can guess the
 position island darkness, will see fire
 seen side pianosa, sea.”
 
“you think, then, fire indicates presence unpleasant
 neighbors?”
 
“that must find out,” returned gaetano, fixing eyes on
 terrestrial star.
 
“how can find out?”
 
“you shall see.”
 
gaetano consulted companions, five minutes’
 discussion manœuvre executed caused vessel tack
 about, returned way come, minutes the
 fire disappeared, hidden elevation land. pilot again
 changed course boat, rapidly approached island,
 soon within fifty paces it. gaetano lowered sail, and
 boat came rest. done silence, the
 moment course changed word spoken.
 
gaetano, proposed expedition, taken the
 responsibility himself; four sailors fixed eyes him,
 got oars held readiness row
 away, which, thanks darkness, difficult. for
 franz, examined arms utmost coolness; two
 double-barrelled guns rifle; loaded them, looked the
 priming, waited quietly.
 
time captain thrown vest shirt, and
 secured trousers round waist; feet naked, no
 shoes stockings take off; preparations placed his
 finger lips, lowering noiselessly sea, swam
 towards shore precaution impossible hear
 slightest sound; traced phosphorescent line
 wake. track soon disappeared; evident had
 touched shore.
 
everyone board remained motionless half hour, same
 luminous track observed, swimmer soon board.
 
“well?” exclaimed franz sailors unison.
 
“they spanish smugglers,” said he; “they two
 corsican bandits.”
 
“and corsican bandits spanish
 smugglers?”
 
“alas,” returned captain accent profound pity,
 “we always help one another. often bandits hard
 pressed gendarmes carbineers; well, see vessel, good
 fellows like us board, come demand hospitality us; you
 can’t refuse help poor hunted devil; receive them, for
 greater security stand sea. costs us nothing, saves
 life, least liberty, fellow-creature, the
 first occasion returns service pointing safe spot where
 can land goods without interruption.”
 
“ah!” said franz, “then smuggler occasionally, gaetano?”
 
“your excellency, must live somehow,” returned other, smiling
 impenetrably.
 
“then know men now monte cristo?”
 
“oh, yes, sailors like freemasons, recognize by
 signs.”
 
“and think nothing fear land?”
 
“nothing all; smugglers thieves.”
 
“but two corsican bandits?” said franz, calculating chances
 peril.
 
“it fault bandits, the
 authorities.”
 
“how so?”
 
“because pursued made stiff, in
 corsican’s nature revenge himself.”
 
“what mean made stiff?—having assassinated man?”
 said franz, continuing investigation.
 
“i mean killed enemy, different
 thing,” returned captain.
 
“well,” said young man, “let us demand hospitality these
 smugglers bandits. think will grant it?”
 
“without doubt.”
 
“how many they?”
 
“four, two bandits make six.”
 
“just number, prove troublesome, shall able
 hold check; so, last time, steer monte cristo.”
 
“yes, excellency will permit us take due precautions.”
 
“by means, wise nestor prudent ulysses; do
 permit, exhort you.”
 
“silence, then!” said gaetano.
 
everyone obeyed. man who, like franz, viewed position its
 true light, grave one. alone darkness with
 sailors know, reason devoted to
 him; knew several thousand francs belt, who
 often examined weapons,—which beautiful,—if with
 envy, least curiosity. hand, land,

 indeed, religious name, seem franz likely

 history scuttled vessels, appeared improbable
 day, seemed probable night; placed between
 two possible sources danger, kept eye crew, his

sailors hoisted sail, vessel more
 cleaving waves. darkness franz, whose eyes now
 accustomed it, see looming shore along boat
 sailing, then, rounded rocky point, saw fire
 brilliant ever, five six persons seated. the
 blaze illumined hundred paces around. gaetano skirted the
 light, carefully keeping boat shadow; then, were
 opposite fire, steered centre circle, singing a
 fishing song, companions sung chorus.
 
first words song men seated round fire arose and

 seeking know new-comers intentions.

 manner sentinel, cried, “who comes there?” sardinian.
 
franz coolly cocked barrels. gaetano exchanged words
 man traveller understand, which
 evidently concerned him.
 
“will excellency give name, remain _incognito_?” asked the
 captain.
 
“my name must rest unknown,” replied franz; “merely say a
 frenchman travelling pleasure.”
 
soon gaetano transmitted answer, sentinel gave an
 order one men seated round fire, rose disappeared
 among rocks. word spoken, everyone seemed occupied, franz

 evident mutually observed other.
 
man disappeared returned suddenly opposite side to
 left; made sign head the
 sentinel, who, turning boat, said, “_s’accommodi_.” italian
 _s’accommodi_ untranslatable; means once, “come, enter, you
 welcome; make home; master.” like
 turkish phrase molière’s astonished bourgeois
 gentleman number things implied utterance.
 
sailors wait second invitation; four strokes the
 oar brought land; gaetano sprang shore, exchanged few
 words sentinel, comrades disembarked, lastly came
 franz. one guns swung shoulder, gaetano the
 other, sailor held rifle; dress, half artist, half dandy,
 excite suspicion, and, consequently, disquietude. the
 boat moored shore, advanced paces find a
 comfortable bivouac; but, doubtless, spot chose suit
 smuggler filled post sentinel, cried out:
 
“not way, please.”
 
gaetano faltered excuse, advanced opposite side, while
 two sailors kindled torches fire light way.
 
advanced thirty paces, stopped small esplanade

 sentry-boxes. around crevices rocks grew dwarf oaks
 thick bushes myrtles. franz lowered torch, saw mass

suspicions, _terra firma_, seen the
 indifferent, friendly, appearance hosts, anxiety had
 quite disappeared, rather, sight goat, turned to
 appetite. mentioned gaetano, replied nothing could
 easy prepare supper boat,
 bread, wine, half dozen partridges, good fire roast by.
 
“besides,” added he, “if smell roast meat tempts you, i
 will go offer two birds slice.”
 
“you born diplomat,” returned franz; “go try.”
 
meanwhile sailors collected dried sticks branches with
 made fire. franz waited impatiently, inhaling aroma of
 roasted meat, captain returned mysterious air.
 
“well,” said franz, “anything new?—do refuse?”
 
“on contrary,” returned gaetano, “the chief, told were
 young frenchman, invites sup him.”
 
“well,” observed franz, “this chief polite, see no
 objection—the bring share supper.”
 
“oh, that; plenty, spare, supper; he
 makes one condition, rather peculiar one, will receive
 house.”
 
“his house? built one here, then?”
 
“no, comfortable one same, say.”
 
“you know chief, then?”
 
“i heard talk him.”
 
“favorably otherwise?”
 
“both.”
 
“the deuce!—and condition?”
 
“that blindfolded, take bandage he
 bids you.”
 
franz looked gaetano, see, possible, thought this
 proposal. “ah,” replied he, guessing franz’s thought, “i know a
 serious matter.”
 
“what place?”
 
“i, nothing lose,—i go.”
 
20075m
 


“you accept?”
 
“yes, curiosity.”
 
“there something peculiar chief, then?”
 
“listen,” said gaetano, lowering voice, “i know they
 say true”—he stopped see anyone near.
 
“what say?”
 
“that chief inhabits cavern pitti palace is
 nothing.”
 
“what nonsense!” said franz, reseating himself.
 
“it nonsense; quite true. cama, pilot _saint
 ferdinand_, went once, came back amazed, vowing such
 treasures heard fairy tales.”
 
“do know,” observed franz, “that stories make me
 think ali baba’s enchanted cavern?”
 
“i tell told.”
 
“then advise accept?”
 
“oh, don’t say that; excellency will please; should
 sorry advise matter.”
 
franz pondered matter moments, concluded man so

 departed reply. franz prudent, wished learn he
 possibly concerning host. turned towards sailor, who,
 dialogue, sat gravely plucking partridges the
 air man proud office, asked men had
 landed, vessel kind visible.
 
“never mind that,” returned sailor, “i know vessel.”
 
“is beautiful vessel?”
 
“i wish better sail round world.”
 
“of burden she?”
 
“about hundred tons; built stand weather. is

“where built?”
 
“i know not; opinion genoese.”
 
“and leader smugglers,” continued franz, “venture build

“i say owner smuggler,” replied sailor.
 
“no; gaetano did, thought.”
 
“gaetano seen vessel distance, then

“and person smuggler, he?”
 
“a wealthy signor, travels pleasure.”
 
“come,” thought franz, “he still mysterious, since two
 accounts agree.”
 
“what name?”
 
“if ask him, says sinbad sailor; doubt his
 real name.”
 
“sinbad sailor?”
 
“yes.”
 
“and reside?”
 
“on sea.”
 
“what country come from?”
 
“i know.”
 
“have ever seen him?”
 
“sometimes.”
 
“what sort man he?”
 
“your excellency will judge yourself.”
 
“where will receive me?”
 
“no doubt subterranean palace gaetano told of.”
 
“have never curiosity, landed found this

“oh, yes, once, always vain; examined grotto

 say door opened key, magic word.”
 
“decidedly,” muttered franz, “this arabian nights’ adventure.”
 
“his excellency waits you,” said voice, recognized as
 sentinel. accompanied two yacht’s crew.
 
franz drew handkerchief pocket, presented the
 man spoken him. without uttering word, bandaged his
 eyes care showed apprehensions committing some
 indiscretion. afterwards made promise make
 least attempt raise bandage. promised.
 
two guides took arms, went on, guided them, and
 preceded sentinel. going thirty paces, smelt the
 appetizing odor kid roasting, knew thus was
 passing bivouac; led fifty paces farther,
 evidently advancing towards part shore not
 allow gaetano go—a refusal now comprehend.
 
presently, change atmosphere, knew were
 entering cave; going seconds heard a
 crackling, seemed though atmosphere changed,
 became balmy perfumed. length feet touched thick
 soft carpet, guides let go hold him. a
 moment’s silence, voice, excellent french, although, with
 foreign accent, said:
 
“welcome, sir. beg will remove bandage.”
 
may supposed, then, franz wait repetition this
 permission, took handkerchief, found the

 tunisian costume, say, red cap long blue silk
 tassel, vest black cloth embroidered gold, pantaloons deep

 astonished franz, treated gaetano’s description fable, was

entire chamber lined crimson brocade, worked flowers

 arabian swords silver scabbards, handles resplendent with
 gems; ceiling hung lamp venetian glass, beautiful

 sunk instep; tapestry hung door franz

host gave franz time recover surprise, and, moreover,
 returned look look, even taking eyes him.
 
“sir,” said, pause, “a thousand excuses precaution

“alas! may say lucullus, anticipated honor

moment tapestry moved aside, nubian, black ebony,
 dressed plain white tunic, made sign master all

“now,” said unknown franz, “i know my

“and i,” replied franz, “will tell you, require wonderful

“well, then, signor aladdin,” replied singular amphitryon, “you

 brief narrative.
 
“and like celebrated sailor whose name assumed,” said,
 way changing conversation, “you pass life in

“yes. made vow time little thought ever be
 able accomplish it,” said unknown singular smile; “and i
 made others also hope may fulfil due season.”
 
although sinbad pronounced words much calmness, eyes
 gave forth gleams extraordinary ferocity.
 
“you suffered great deal, sir?” said franz inquiringly.
 
sinbad started looked fixedly him, replied, “what makes

“everything,” answered franz,—“your voice, look, pallid

“ah!” responded sinbad, laughing singular laugh, which

supper appeared supplied solely franz, the

 eyes towards host saw smile disappointment.
 
“you guess,” said he, “what small vase, can

“no, really cannot.”
 
“well, then, green preserve nothing less ambrosia

“but,” replied franz, “this ambrosia, doubt, passing through
 mortal hands lost heavenly appellation assumed human
 name; vulgar phrase, may term composition, which,
 tell truth, feel particular desire?”
 
“ah, thus material origin revealed,” cried sinbad;
 “we frequently pass near happiness without seeing, without

franz strange transformation taken place him. the

 lightness, perception brightened remarkable manner, senses
 seemed redouble power, horizon continued expand; it
 gloomy horizon vague alarms, seen

 songs became louder, enchanting mysterious harmony rose

chapter 32. waking
 
franz returned himself, seemed still dream. he
 thought sepulchre, ray sunlight pity
 scarcely penetrated. stretched forth hand, touched stone; he
 rose seat, found lying bournous bed of
 dry heather, soft odoriferous. vision fled; if
 statues shadows tomb, vanished at
 waking.
 
advanced several paces towards point whence light came, and
 excitement dream succeeded calmness reality.

 shining beams morning sun; shore sailors
 sitting, chatting laughing; ten yards the
 boat anchor, undulating gracefully water.

 brow, listened dash waves beach, left
 rocks lace foam white silver. some
 time without reflection thought divine charm the
 things nature, specially fantastic dream; gradually
 view outer world, calm, pure, grand, reminded him
 illusiveness vision, awakened memory. he
 recalled arrival island, presentation smuggler
 chief, subterranean palace full splendor, excellent supper, and
 spoonful hashish.
 
seemed, however, even face open day, least a
 year elapsed since things passed, deep the
 impression made mind dream, strong hold it
 taken imagination. thus every now saw fancy amid
 sailors, seated rock, undulating vessel, one the
 shadows shared dream looks kisses. otherwise,
 head perfectly clear, body refreshed; free from

“the signor sinbad left compliments excellency, and
 desires us express regret feels able take his

 business calls malaga.”
 
“so, then, gaetano,” said franz, “this is, then, reality; there
 exists man received island, entertained right
 royally, departed asleep?”
 
“he exists certainly may see small yacht all
 sails spread; will use glass, will, all
 probability, recognize host midst crew.”
 
saying, gaetano pointed direction small vessel was

“there, hear?” observed gaetano; “he bidding adieu.”
 
young man took carbine fired air, without any

“what excellency’s orders?” inquired gaetano.
 
“in first place, light torch.”
 
“ah, yes, understand,” replied patron, “to find entrance to
 enchanted apartment. much pleasure, excellency, it
 amuse you; will get torch ask for. too
 idea have, two three times fancy has
 come me; always given up. giovanni, light torch,”
 added, “and give excellency.”
 
giovanni obeyed. franz took lamp, entered subterranean
 grotto, followed gaetano. recognized place had
 awaked bed heather there; vain he
 carried torch round exterior surface grotto. saw
 nothing, unless that, traces smoke, others him
 attempted thing, and, like him, vain. yet leave
 foot granite wall, impenetrable futurity, without
 strict scrutiny; see fissure without introducing blade

 lost two hours attempts, last utterly useless. at
 end time gave search, gaetano smiled.
 
franz appeared shore, yacht seemed like a
 small white speck horizon. looked glass,
 even distinguish anything.
 
gaetano reminded come purpose shooting
 goats, utterly forgotten. took fowling-piece, and
 began hunt island air man fulfilling a
 duty, rather enjoying pleasure; end quarter of
 hour killed goat two kids. animals, though wild
 agile chamois, much like domestic goats, franz
 consider game. moreover, ideas, much more
 enthralling, occupied mind. since, evening before, had
 really hero one tales _thousand one

then, spite failure first search, began second,
 told gaetano roast one two kids. second

 saw little yacht, now like sea-gull wave,
 continuing flight towards corsica.
 
“why,” remarked gaetano, “you told signor sinbad was
 going malaga, seems direction of

“don’t remember,” said patron, “i told among crew

“true; going land them,” added franz.
 
“precisely so,” replied gaetano. “ah, one fears neither god

“but services might involve authorities of

 franz.
 
“and cares that,” replied gaetano laugh, “or any
 authorities? smiles them. let try pursue him! why, the
 first place, yacht ship, bird, beat any
 frigate three knots every nine; throw on

perfectly clear signor sinbad, franz’s host, the

“count,” returned signor pastrini, hurt albert’s repeated doubts of
 truth assertions, “i say you, your
 companion, knows rome, knows, too, things to

“my dear fellow,” said albert, turning franz, “here admirable
 adventure; will fill carriage pistols, blunderbusses, and
 double-barrelled guns. luigi vampa comes take us, take him—we
 bring back rome, present holiness pope, who
 asks can repay great service; merely ask a
 carriage pair horses, see carnival carriage,
 doubtless roman people will crown us capitol, and

“let us see watch,” said albert.
 
signor pastrini drew fob magnificent bréguet, bearing the

“here is,” said he.
 
“_peste!_” returned albert, “i compliment it; its

another motive influenced albert’s selection seat,—who knew

“is there, indeed, good fellow? pray tell me, sympathy of

“no; taste,” continued franz gravely.
 
“and manner congeniality mind evinced?”

“no, no,” cried countess; “you must leave me. depend upon you

“is possible,” whispered franz, “that entertain fear?”
 
“i’ll tell you,” answered countess. “byron perfect

nothing else left franz take hat,

 feel arm tremble assisted carriage. upon
 arriving hotel, franz perceived deceived when
 spoke expecting company; contrary, return before
 appointed hour seemed greatly astonish servants.
 
“excuse little subterfuge,” said countess, reply her
 companion’s half-reproachful observation subject; “but that
 horrid man made feel quite uncomfortable, longed be
 alone, might compose startled mind.”
 
franz essayed smile.
 
“nay,” said she, “do smile; ill accords expression of
 countenance, sure spring heart.
 however, promise one thing.”
 
“what it?”
 
“promise me, say.”
 
“i will anything desire, except relinquish determination of

“where comes ignorant; can readily tell he

“let us speak promise wished make,” said franz.
 
“well, then, must give word return immediately your

saying, countess quitted franz, leaving unable decide
 whether merely amusing expense, whether her
 fears agitations genuine.
 
upon return hotel, franz found albert dressing-gown
 slippers, listlessly extended sofa, smoking cigar.
 
“my dear fellow!” cried he, springing up, “is really you? why, did
 expect see tomorrow.”
 
“my dear albert,” replied franz, “i glad opportunity tell
 you, forever, entertain erroneous notion
 concerning italian women. thought continual failures

“upon soul, women puzzle devil read them

“and reason women fine country, ‘where sounds

“at what? sight respectable gentleman sitting opposite

franz smiled; well remembered albert particularly prided

“well, tends confirm ideas,” said franz, “that the
 countess’s suspicions destitute alike sense reason. he
 speak hearing? catch words?”
 
“i did; uttered romaic dialect. knew from

“he spoke romaic language, he?”
 
“i think so.”
 
“that settles it,” murmured franz. “’tis he, past doubt.”
 
“what say?”
 
“nothing, nothing. tell me, thinking i

“oh, arranging little surprise you.”
 
“indeed. nature?”
 
“why, know quite impossible procure carriage.”
 
“certainly; also know done human means

“now, then, difficulty bright idea flashed across my

franz looked albert though much confidence the
 suggestions imagination.
 
“i tell what, m. franz,” cried albert, “you deserve called
 misgiving incredulous glance were
 pleased bestow just now.”
 
“and promise give satisfaction gentleman your
 scheme turns ingenious assert.”
 
“well, then, hearken me.”
 
“i listen.”
 
“you agree, not, obtaining carriage the
 question?”
 
“i do.”
 
“neither can procure horses?”
 
“true; offered sum, failed.”
 
“well, now, say cart? dare say thing might be

“very possibly.”
 
“and pair oxen?”
 
“as easily found cart.”
 
“then see, good fellow, cart couple oxen our

“well,” said franz, “this time, m. albert, bound give you

“and quite national one, too,” replied albert gratified pride.
 “a mere masque borrowed festivities. ha, ha, ye romans!

“only host. upon return home sent him, then

“and now?”
 
“who?”
 
“our host.”
 
“gone search equipage, tomorrow might late.”
 
“then will able give us answer tonight.”
 
“oh, expect every minute.”
 
instant door opened, head signor pastrini
 appeared. “_permesso_?” inquired he.
 
“certainly—certainly,” cried franz. “come in, host.”
 
“now, then,” asked albert eagerly, “have found desired cart and
 oxen?”
 
“better that!” replied signor pastrini, air man
 perfectly well satisfied himself.
 
“take care, worthy host,” said albert, “_better_ sure enemy to
 _well_.”
 
“let excellencies leave matter me,” returned signor
 pastrini tone indicative unbounded self-confidence.
 
“but _have_ done?” asked franz. “speak out, there’s worthy
 fellow.”
 
“your excellencies aware,” responded landlord, swelling with
 importance, “that count monte cristo living floor
 yourselves!”
 
“i think know it,” exclaimed albert, “since owing
 circumstance packed small rooms, like
 two poor students back streets paris.”
 
“when, then, count monte cristo, hearing dilemma which
 placed, sent offer seats carriage two
 places windows palazzo rospoli.” friends looked at
 unutterable surprise.
 
“but think,” asked albert, “that accept offers
 perfect stranger?”
 
“what sort person count monte cristo?” asked franz his
 host.
 
“a great nobleman, whether maltese sicilian cannot
 exactly say; know, noble borghese rich
 gold mine.”
 
“it seems me,” said franz, speaking undertone albert, “that
 person merited high panegyrics landlord, would
 conveyed invitation another channel, permitted
 brought us unceremonious way. have
 written—or——”
 
instant someone knocked door.
 
“come in,” said franz.
 
servant, wearing livery considerable style richness,
 appeared threshold, and, placing two cards landlord’s
 hands, forthwith presented two young men, said:
 
“please deliver these, count monte cristo vicomte
 albert morcerf m. franz d’Épinay. count monte cristo,”
 continued servant, “begs gentlemen’s permission wait upon
 neighbor, will honored intimation what
 time will please receive him.”
 
“faith, franz,” whispered albert, “there much find fault with
 here.”
 
“tell count,” replied franz, “that will the
 pleasure calling him.”
 
servant bowed retired.
 
“that call elegant mode attack,” said albert, “you were
 quite correct said, signor pastrini. count monte
 cristo unquestionably man first-rate breeding knowledge of
 world.”
 
“then accept offer?” said host.
 
“of course do,” replied albert. “still, must sorry be
 obliged give cart group reapers—it have
 produced effect! windows palazzo
 rospoli, way recompense loss beautiful scheme, i
 don’t know held original plan. say
 you, franz?”
 
“oh, agree you; windows palazzo rospoli alone decided
 me.”
 
truth was, mention two places palazzo rospoli
 recalled franz conversation overheard preceding
 evening ruins colosseum mysterious unknown
 transteverin, stranger cloak undertaken
 obtain freedom condemned criminal; muffled-up
 individual proved (as franz felt sure would) person
 just seen teatro argentina, able to
 establish identity, also prosecute researches respecting
 perfect facility freedom.
 
franz passed night confused dreams respecting two meetings
 already mysterious tormentor, waking
 speculations morrow produce. next day must
 clear every doubt; unless near neighbor would-be friend,
 count monte cristo, possessed ring gyges, its
 power able render invisible, certain he
 escape time.
 
eight o’clock found franz dressed, albert, the
 motives early rising, still soundly asleep. first act
 franz summon landlord, presented his
 accustomed obsequiousness.
 
“pray, signor pastrini,” asked franz, “is execution appointed
 take place today?”
 
“yes, excellency; reason inquiry may
 procure window view from, much late.”
 
“oh, no,” answered franz, “i intention; even had
 felt wish witness spectacle, might done monte
 pincio; not?”
 
“ah!” exclaimed mine host, “i think likely excellency
 chosen mingle rabble always collected
 hill, which, indeed, consider exclusively belonging to
 themselves.”
 
“very possibly may go,” answered franz; “but case feel
 disposed, give particulars today’s executions.”
 
“what particulars excellency like hear?”
 
“why, number persons condemned suffer, names, and
 description death die.”
 
“that happens just lucky, excellency! minutes ago they
 brought _tavolettas_.”
 
“what they?”
 
“sort wooden tablets hung corners streets evening
 execution, pasted paper containing names
 condemned persons, crimes, mode punishment. the
 reason publicly announcing is, good and
 faithful catholics may offer prayers unfortunate
 culprits, and, all, beseech heaven grant sincere
 repentance.”
 
“and tablets brought may add prayers to
 faithful, they?” asked franz somewhat incredulously.
 
“oh, dear, no, excellency! time anybody’s affairs
 honorable guests; make agreement
 man pastes papers, brings he
 playbills, case person staying hotel should
 like witness execution, may obtain every requisite information
 concerning time place etc.”
 
“upon word, delicate attention part, signor
 pastrini,” cried franz.
 
“why, excellency,” returned landlord, chuckling rubbing
 hands infinite complacency, “i think may take upon to
 say neglect nothing deserve support patronage noble
 visitors poor hotel.”
 
“i see plainly enough, excellent host, may rely
 upon proclaim striking proof attention your
 guests wherever go. meanwhile, oblige sight one these
 _tavolettas_.”
 
“nothing can easier comply excellency’s wish,”
 said landlord, opening door chamber; “i caused one
 placed landing, close apartment.”
 
then, taking tablet wall, handed franz, read
 follows:
 
“‘the public informed wednesday, february 23rd, the
 first day carnival, executions will take place piazza del
 popolo, order tribunal rota, two persons, named
 andrea rondolo, peppino, otherwise called rocca priori; former

 don césar torlini, canon church st. john lateran; the
 latter convicted accomplice atrocious sanguinary
 bandit, luigi vampa, band. first-named malefactor will be
 _mazzolato_, second culprit _decapitato_.
 
“‘the prayers good christians entreated these
 unfortunate men, may please god awaken sense of
 guilt, grant hearty sincere repentance for
 crimes.’”
 
precisely franz heard evening ruins
 colosseum. part programme differed,—the names the
 condemned persons, crimes, mode punishment, agreed
 previous information. probability, therefore, the
 transteverin bandit luigi vampa himself, the
 man shrouded mantle known “sinbad the
 sailor,” who, doubt, still pursuing philanthropic
 expedition rome, already done porto-vecchio tunis.
 
time getting on, however, franz deemed advisable awaken
 albert; moment prepared proceed chamber, his
 friend entered room perfect costume day. anticipated

“now, excellent signor pastrini,” said franz, addressing his
 landlord, “since ready, think may proceed once

“most assuredly,” replied he. “the count monte cristo always an
 early riser; can answer two hours.”
 
“then really consider shall intruding pay our
 respects directly?”

“oh, quite sure. will take blame find i
 led error.”
 
“well, then, so, ready, albert?”
 
“perfectly.”
 
“let us go return best thanks courtesy.”
 
“yes, let us so.”
 
landlord preceded friends across landing, all
 separated apartments count, rang bell,
 and, upon door opened servant, said:
 
“_i signori francesi_.”
 
domestic bowed respectfully, invited enter. passed

“if excellencies will please seated,” said man, “i will

 ears young men, almost immediately lost, rapid
 closing door merely allowed one rich swell harmony enter.

“hush, hush!” replied franz; “we shall ascertain is—he

franz spoke, heard sound door turning hinges, and
 almost immediately afterwards tapestry drawn aside, the

“franz thank thousand times, count,” returned
 albert; “you extricated us great dilemma, the

“indeed,” returned count, motioning two young men sit down.
 “it fault blockhead pastrini, sooner

two young men bowed. franz had, yet, found nothing say; he
 come determination, nothing count’s manner
 manifested wish recognize him, know
 whether make allusion past, wait more
 proof; besides, although sure box the
 previous evening, equally positive the
 man seen colosseum. resolved, therefore, let things
 take course without making direct overture count.
 moreover, advantage, master count’s secret,
 count hold franz, nothing conceal.
 however, resolved lead conversation subject might
 possibly clear doubts.
 
“count,” said he, “you offered us places carriage, at
 windows rospoli palace. can tell us can obtain
 sight piazza popolo?”
 
“ah,” said count negligently, looking attentively morcerf, “is
 something like execution upon piazza popolo?”
 
“yes,” returned franz, finding count coming point

“stay, think told steward yesterday attend this; perhaps i
 can render slight service also.”

“did ever occupy yourself,” said franz, “with employment

“monsieur bertuccio,” said count, “you procured windows

“yes, excellency,” returned steward; “but late.”
 
“did tell wished one?” replied count, frowning.
 
“and excellency one, let prince lobanieff; i

“that will do—that will do, monsieur bertuccio; spare gentlemen

steward bowed, quit room.
 
“ah!” continued count, “be good enough ask pastrini has
 received _tavoletta_, can send us account the
 execution.”
 
“there need that,” said franz, taking tablets; “for
 saw account, copied down.”
 
“very well, can retire, m. bertuccio; need longer. let us
 know breakfast ready. gentlemen,” added he, turning to
 two friends, “will, trust, honor breakfast me?”
 
“but, dear count,” said albert, “we shall abuse kindness.”
 
“not all; contrary, will give great pleasure. you
 will, one you, perhaps both, return paris. m.
 bertuccio, lay covers three.”
 
took franz’s tablets hand. “‘we announce,’ read,

“really?” said franz.
 
“yes, passed evening cardinal rospigliosi’s, there

“for andrea rondolo?” asked franz.
 
“no,” replied count, carelessly; “for (he glanced the

“really, count,” replied franz, “one think studied
 different tortures nations world.”
 
“there are, least, seen,” said count coldly.
 
“and took pleasure beholding dreadful spectacles?”
 
“my first sentiment horror, second indifference, third
 curiosity.”
 
“curiosity—that terrible word.”
 
“why so? life, greatest preoccupation death; then,
 curious study different ways soul body can

“i quite understand you,” replied franz; “pray explain your

“listen,” said count, deep hatred mounted face, the
 blood face other. “if man unheard-of and

“yes, know,” said franz, “that human justice insufficient to

“i will put another case you,” continued count; “that where
 society, attacked death person, avenges death death. but

“yes,” answered franz; “and punish duelling is

“ah, duelling,” cried count; “a pleasant manner, upon soul, of

“then disapprove duelling? fight duel?” asked
 albert turn, astonished strange theory.
 
“oh, yes,” replied count; “understand me, fight duel for

“but,” said franz count, “with theory, renders at

spoke, servant opened one four doors apartment,
 saying:
 
“_al suo commodo!_”
 
two young men arose entered breakfast-room.
 
meal, excellent, admirably served, franz
 looked repeatedly albert, order observe impressions which
 doubted made words entertainer;
 whether usual carelessness paid little
 attention him, whether explanation count monte cristo
 regard duelling satisfied him, whether events which
 franz knew effect alone, remarked his
 companion pay least regard them, contrary ate
 like man last four five months condemned to
 partake italian cookery—that is, worst world.
 
count, just touched dishes; seemed fulfil the
 duties host sitting guests, awaited their
 departure served strange delicate food. this
 brought back franz, spite himself, recollection the
 terror count inspired countess g——, firm
 conviction man opposite box vampire.
 
end breakfast franz took watch.
 
“well,” said count, “what doing?”
 
“you must excuse us, count,” returned franz, “but still much to
 do.”
 
“what may be?”
 
“we masks, absolutely necessary procure them.”
 
“do concern that; have, think, private room
 piazza popolo; will whatever costumes choose
 brought us, can dress there.”
 
“after execution?” cried franz.
 
“before after, whichever please.”
 
“opposite scaffold?”
 
“the scaffold forms part _fête_.”
 
“count, reflected matter,” said franz, “i thank for
 courtesy, shall content accepting place in
 carriage window rospoli palace, leave you
 liberty dispose place piazza popolo.”
 
“but warn you, will lose curious sight,” returned the
 count.
 
“you will describe me,” replied franz, “and recital your
 lips will make great impression witnessed it. i
 intended witnessing execution, never
 able make mind; you, albert?”
 
“i,” replied viscount,—“i saw castaing executed, think was
 rather intoxicated day, quitted college same
 morning, passed previous night tavern.”
 
“besides, reason seen execution at
 paris, see one anywhere else; travel, it
 see everything. think figure will make are

 and, besides, say culprit infamous scoundrel, who

“shall go, then, albert?” asked franz.
 
“_ma foi_, yes; like you, hesitated, count’s eloquence
 decides me.”
 
“let us go, then,” said franz, “since wish it; way to
 piazza popolo, wish pass corso. this
 possible, count?”
 
“on foot, yes, carriage, no.”
 
“i will go foot, then.”
 
“is important go way?”
 
“yes, something wish see.”
 
“well, will go corso. will send carriage wait for

“excellency,” said servant, opening door, “a man dress of
 penitent wishes speak you.”
 
“ah! yes,” returned count, “i know is, gentlemen; will you
 return salon? will find good cigars centre table. i
 will directly.”
 
young men rose returned salon, count, again
 apologizing, left another door. albert, great smoker, and
 considered small sacrifice deprived cigars
 café paris, approached table, uttered cry joy at
 perceiving veritable _puros_.
 
“well,” asked franz, “what think count monte cristo?”
 
“what think?” said albert, evidently surprised question
 companion; “i think delightful fellow, the
 honors table admirably; travelled much, read much, is,
 like brutus, stoic school, moreover,” added he, sending a
 volume smoke towards ceiling, “that excellent cigars.”
 
albert’s opinion count, franz well knew that
 albert professed never form opinion except upon long reflection,
 made attempt change it.
 
“but,” said he, “did observe one singular thing?”
 
“what?”
 
“how attentively looked you.”
 
“at me?”
 
“yes.”
 
albert reflected. “ah,” replied he, sighing, “that very
 surprising; year absent paris, my
 clothes antiquated cut; count takes a
 provincial. first opportunity have, undeceive him, beg, and
 tell nothing kind.”
 
franz smiled; instant count entered.
 
“i now quite service, gentlemen,” said he. “the carriage is
 going one way piazza popolo, will go another; and, if
 please, corso. take cigars, m. de
 morcerf.”
 
“with heart,” returned albert; “italian cigars horrible.
 come paris, will return this.”
 
“i will refuse; intend going soon, since allow me,
 will pay visit. come, time lose, is
 half-past twelve—let us set off.”
 
three descended; coachman received master’s orders, and
 drove via babuino. three gentlemen walked along
 piazza di spagna via frattina, led directly between
 fiano rospoli palaces, franz’s attention directed towards
 windows last palace, forgotten signal
 agreed upon man mantle transtevere peasant.
 
“which windows?” asked count, much
 indifference assume.
 
“the three last,” returned he, negligence evidently unaffected,
 imagine intention question put.
 
franz glanced rapidly towards three windows. side windows were
 hung yellow damask, centre one white damask red
 cross. man mantle kept promise transteverin,
 now doubt count.
 
three windows still untenanted. preparations making on
 every side; chairs placed, scaffolds raised, windows were
 hung flags. masks appear; carriages not
 move about; masks visible behind windows, the
 carriages, doors.
 
franz, albert, count continued descend corso. they
 approached piazza popolo, crowd became dense, and
 heads multitude two objects visible: obelisk,

“as left choice costumes me,” said count the

franz heard words count imperfectly, perhaps did
 fully appreciate new attention wishes; was
 wholly absorbed spectacle piazza popolo presented,

first time franz ever seen guillotine,—we say
 guillotine, roman _mandaïa_ formed almost same
 model french instrument.7 knife, shaped like a
 crescent, cuts convex side, falls less height, and
 difference.
 
two men, seated movable plank victim laid, were
 eating breakfasts, waiting criminal. repast
 consisted apparently bread sausages. one lifted the
 plank, took flask wine, drank some, passed his
 companion. two men executioner’s assistants.
 
sight franz felt perspiration start forth upon brow.
 
prisoners, transported previous evening carceri nuove
 little church santa maria popolo, passed night,
 accompanied two priests, chapel closed grating,
 two sentinels, relieved intervals. a
 double line carbineers, placed side door the
 church, reached scaffold, formed circle around it, leaving
 path ten feet wide, around guillotine space nearly
 hundred feet.
 
rest square paved heads. many women held their
 infants shoulders, thus children best view.
 monte pincio seemed vast amphitheatre filled spectators; the
 balconies two churches corner via babuino and
 via di ripetta crammed; steps even seemed parti-colored
 sea, impelled towards portico; every niche wall
 held living statue. count said true—the curious
 spectacle life death.
 
yet, instead silence solemnity demanded the
 occasion, laughter jests arose crowd. evident that
 execution was, eyes people, commencement of
 carnival.
 
suddenly tumult ceased, magic, doors church
 opened. brotherhood penitents, clothed head foot robes
 gray sackcloth, holes eyes, holding hands
 lighted tapers, appeared first; chief marched head.

behind executioner came, order die,

 neither eyes bandaged.
 
peppino walked firm step, doubtless aware awaited him.
 andrea supported two priests. them, time time,
 kissed crucifix confessor held them.
 
sight alone franz felt legs tremble him. looked at
 albert—he white shirt, mechanically cast away his
 cigar, although half smoked it. count alone seemed
 unmoved—nay, more, slight color seemed striving rise pale
 cheeks. nostrils dilated like wild beast scents its
 prey, lips, half opened, disclosed white teeth, small and
 sharp like jackal. yet features wore expression
 smiling tenderness, franz never witnessed in
 them; black eyes especially full kindness pity.
 
however, two culprits advanced, approached faces
 became visible. peppino handsome young man four or
 five-and-twenty, bronzed sun; carried head erect, and
 seemed watch see side liberator appear.
 andrea short fat; visage, marked brutal cruelty, did
 indicate age; might thirty. prison suffered his
 beard grow; head fell shoulder, legs bent beneath
 him, movements apparently automatic unconscious.
 
“i thought,” said franz count, “that told be
 one execution.”
 
“i told true,” replied coldly.
 
“and yet two culprits.”
 
“yes; one two die; many
 years live.”
 
“if pardon come, time lose.”
 
“and see, is,” said count. moment peppino
 reached foot _mandaïa_, priest arrived haste,
 forced way soldiers, and, advancing chief the
 brotherhood, gave folded paper. piercing eye peppino had
 noticed all. chief took paper, unfolded it, and, raising his
 hand, “heaven praised, holiness also,” said loud
 voice; “here pardon one prisoners!”
 
“a pardon!” cried people one voice; “a pardon!”
 
cry andrea raised head.
 
“pardon whom?” cried he.
 
peppino remained breathless.
 
“a pardon peppino, called rocca priori,” said principal friar.
 passed paper officer commanding carbineers, who
 read returned him.
 
“for peppino!” cried andrea, seemed roused torpor which
 plunged. “why me? die
 together. promised die me. right to
 put death alone. will die alone—i will not!”
 
broke priests struggling raving like wild beast,
 striving desperately break cords bound hands. the
 executioner made sign, two assistants leaped the
 scaffold seized him.
 
“what going on?” asked franz count; for, talk was
 roman dialect, perfectly understood it.
 
“do see?” returned count, “that human creature is
 die furious fellow-sufferer perish with
 him? and, able, rather tear pieces his
 teeth nails let enjoy life be
 deprived of. oh, man, man—race crocodiles,” cried count,
 extending clenched hands towards crowd, “how well i
 recognize there, times worthy of
 yourselves!”
 
meanwhile andrea two executioners struggling the
 ground, kept exclaiming, “he die!—he shall die!—i will
 die alone!”
 
“look, look,” cried count, seizing young men’s hands; “look,
 soul curious. man resigned to
 fate, going scaffold die—like coward, is
 true, die without resistance. know gave
 strength? know consoled him? was, another
 partook punishment—that another partook anguish—that
 another die him! lead two sheep butcher’s, two
 oxen slaughterhouse, make one understand his
 companion will die; sheep will bleat pleasure, ox will
 bellow joy. man—man, god created image—man,
 upon god laid first, sole commandment, love his
 neighbor—man, god given voice express his
 thoughts—what first cry hears fellow-man saved? a
 blasphemy. honor man, masterpiece nature, king the
 creation!”
 
count burst laugh; terrible laugh, showed must
 suffered horribly able thus laugh.
 
however, struggle still continued, dreadful witness.
 two assistants carried andrea scaffold; people all
 took part andrea, twenty thousand voices cried, “put to
 death! put death!”
 
franz sprang back, count seized arm, held before
 window.
 
“what doing?” said he. “do pity him? heard cry
 ‘mad dog!’ take gun—you unhesitatingly shoot
 poor beast, who, all, guilty bitten
 another dog. yet pity man who, without bitten one
 race, yet murdered benefactor; who, now unable to
 kill anyone, hands bound, wishes see companion
 captivity perish. no, no—look, look!”

recommendation needless. franz fascinated horrible
 spectacle.
 
two assistants borne andrea scaffold, there, in
 spite struggles, bites, cries, forced his
 knees. time executioner raised mace, signed
 get way; criminal strove rise, but, ere he
 time, mace fell left temple. dull heavy sound was
 heard, man dropped like ox face, turned over
 back.
 
executioner let fall mace, drew knife, one stroke
 opened throat, mounting stomach, stamped violently it
 feet. every stroke jet blood sprang wound.
 
time franz contain longer, sank, half
 fainting, seat.
 
albert, eyes closed, standing grasping the
 window-curtains.
 
count erect triumphant, like avenging angel!
 


chapter 36. carnival rome
 
franz recovered senses, saw albert drinking glass of
 water, which, judge pallor, stood great need; and
 count, assuming masquerade costume. glanced
 mechanically towards piazza—the scene wholly changed; scaffold,
 executioners, victims, disappeared; people remained,
 full noise excitement. bell monte citorio, only
 sounds pope’s decease opening carnival, was
 ringing joyous peal.
 
“well,” asked count, “what has, then, happened?”
 
“nothing,” replied count; “only, see, carnival has
 commenced. make haste dress yourself.”
 
“in fact,” said franz, “this horrible scene passed away like a
 dream.”
 
“it dream, nightmare, disturbed you.”
 
“yes, suffered; culprit?”
 
“that dream also; remained asleep, have
 awakened; knows fortunate?”
 
“but peppino—what become him?”
 
“peppino lad sense, who, unlike men, happy in
 proportion noticed, delighted see general
 attention directed towards companion. profited this
 distraction slip away among crowd, without even thanking the
 worthy priests accompanied him. decidedly man ungrateful and
 egotistical animal. dress yourself; see, m. morcerf sets the
 example.”
 
albert drawing satin pantaloon black trousers and
 varnished boots.
 
“well, albert,” said franz, “do feel much inclined join the
 revels? come, answer frankly.”
 
“_ma foi_, no,” returned albert. “but really glad seen
 sight; understand count said—that have
 habituated similar spectacle, one
 causes emotion.”
 
20175m
 


“without reflecting moment can study
 character,” said count; “on steps scaffold death tears
 mask worn life, real visage is
 disclosed. must allowed andrea handsome, the
 hideous scoundrel! come, dress yourselves, gentlemen, dress
 yourselves.”
 
franz felt ridiculous follow two companions’
 example. assumed costume, fastened mask scarcely
 equalled pallor face. toilet finished, they
 descended; carriage awaited door, filled with
 sweetmeats bouquets. fell line carriages.
 
difficult form idea perfect change taken
 place. instead spectacle gloomy silent death, piazza
 popolo presented spectacle gay noisy mirth revelry. a
 crowd masks flowed sides, emerging doors,
 descending windows. every street every corner drove
 carriages filled clowns, harlequins, dominoes, mummers,
 pantomimists, transteverins, knights, peasants, screaming,
 fighting, gesticulating, throwing eggs filled flour, confetti,
 nosegays, attacking, sarcasms missiles, friends
 foes, companions strangers, indiscriminately, one took
 offence, anything laugh.
 
franz albert like men who, drive away violent sorrow,
 recourse wine, who, drink become intoxicated,
 feel thick veil drawn past present. saw, or
 rather continued see, image witnessed; but
 little little general vertigo seized them, felt
 obliged take part noise confusion.
 
handful confetti came neighboring carriage, which,
 covered morcerf two companions dust, pricked his
 neck portion face uncovered mask like hundred
 pins, incited join general combat, masks
 around engaged. rose turn, seizing handfuls of
 confetti sweetmeats, carriage filled, cast them
 force skill master of.
 
20177m
 


strife fairly begun, recollection seen
 half hour gradually effaced young men’s minds,
 much occupied gay glittering procession they
 now beheld.
 
count monte cristo, never instant shown any
 appearance moved. imagine large splendid corso,
 bordered one end lofty palaces, their
 balconies hung carpets, windows flags. these
 balconies three hundred thousand spectators—romans, italians,
 strangers parts world, united aristocracy birth,
 wealth, genius. lovely women, yielding influence the
 scene, bend balconies, lean windows, and
 shower confetti, returned bouquets; air seems
 darkened falling confetti flying flowers. streets
 lively crowd dressed fantastic costumes—gigantic
 cabbages walk gravely about, buffaloes’ heads bellow men’s
 shoulders, dogs walk hind legs; midst a
 mask lifted, and, callot’s temptation st. anthony, lovely
 face exhibited, fain follow, are
 separated troops fiends. will give faint idea the
 carnival rome.
 
second turn, count stopped carriage, requested
 permission withdraw, leaving vehicle disposal. franz
 looked up—they opposite rospoli palace. centre window,
 one hung white damask red cross, blue domino,
 beneath franz’s imagination easily pictured beautiful greek
 argentina.
 
“gentlemen,” said count, springing out, “when tired of
 actors, wish become spectators scene, know you
 places windows. meantime, dispose coachman, my
 carriage, servants.”
 
forgotten mention, count’s coachman attired in
 bear-skin, exactly resembling odry’s _the bear pasha_; and
 two footmen behind dressed green monkeys, spring
 masks, made grimaces everyone passed.
 
franz thanked count attention. albert, busily
 occupied throwing bouquets carriage full roman peasants that
 passing near him. unfortunately him, line carriages
 moved again, descended piazza popolo, other
 ascended towards palazzo di venezia.
 
“ah, dear fellow,” said franz; “you see?”
 
“what?”
 
“there,—that calash filled roman peasants.”
 
“no.”
 
“well, convinced charming women.”
 
“how unfortunate masked, albert,” said franz; “here was
 opportunity making past disappointments.”
 
“oh,” replied he, half laughing, half serious; “i hope carnival
 will pass without amends one shape other.”
 
but, spite albert’s hope, day passed unmarked any
 incident, excepting two three encounters carriage full of
 roman peasants. one encounters, accidentally purposely,
 albert’s mask fell off. instantly rose cast remainder the
 bouquets carriage. doubtless one charming females
 albert detected beneath coquettish disguise touched by
 gallantry; for, carriage two friends passed her, she
 threw bunch violets. albert seized it, franz reason
 suppose meant him, suffered albert retain it.
 albert placed button-hole, carriage went triumphantly
 on.
 
“well,” said franz him; “there beginning adventure.”
 
“laugh please—i really think so. will abandon this
 bouquet.”
 
“_pardieu_,” returned franz, laughing, “in token ingratitude.”
 
jest, however, soon appeared become earnest; albert and
 franz encountered carriage _contadini_, one who
 thrown violets albert, clapped hands beheld
 button-hole.
 
“bravo, bravo,” said franz; “things go wonderfully. shall leave you?
 perhaps prefer alone?”
 
“no,” replied he; “i will caught like fool first
 disclosure rendezvous clock, say the
 opera-balls. fair peasant wishes carry matters further,
 shall find her, rather, will find us tomorrow; will
 give sign other, shall know do.”
 
“on word,” said franz, “you wise nestor prudent as
 ulysses, fair circe must skilful powerful if
 succeed changing beast kind.”
 
albert right; fair unknown resolved, doubtless, carry
 intrigue farther; although young men made several more
 turns, see calash, turned one of
 neighboring streets. returned rospoli palace; but
 count blue domino also disappeared; two windows,
 hung yellow damask, still occupied persons the
 count invited.
 
moment bell proclaimed beginning the
 mascherata sounded retreat. file corso broke line,
 second carriages disappeared. franz albert
 opposite via delle muratte; coachman, without saying a
 word, drove it, passed along piazza di spagna rospoli
 palace stopped door hotel. signor pastrini came to
 door receive guests.
 
franz hastened inquire count, express regret that
 returned sufficient time; pastrini reassured by
 saying count monte cristo ordered second carriage for
 himself, gone four o’clock fetch the
 rospoli palace.
 
count had, moreover, charged offer two friends key
 box argentina. franz questioned albert his
 intentions; albert great projects put execution before
 going theatre; instead making answer, inquired if
 signor pastrini procure tailor.
 
“a tailor,” said host; “and what?”
 
“to make us now tomorrow two roman peasant costumes,”
 returned albert.
 
host shook head.
 
“to make two costumes now tomorrow? ask your
 excellencies’ pardon, quite french demand; next
 week will find single tailor consent sew six
 buttons waistcoat paid crown piece each
 button.”
 
“then must give idea?”
 
“no; ready-made. leave me; tomorrow, you
 awake, shall find collection costumes will be
 satisfied.”
 
“my dear albert,” said franz, “leave host; already
 proved full resources; let us dine quietly, afterwards
 go see _l’italienne à alger!_
 
“agreed,” returned albert; “but remember, signor pastrini, my
 friend attach greatest importance tomorrow the
 costumes asked for.”
 
host assured might rely him, their
 wishes attended to; upon franz albert mounted to
 apartments, proceeded disencumber their
 costumes. albert, took dress, carefully preserved the
 bunch violets; token reserved morrow.
 
two friends sat table; refrain from
 remarking difference count monte cristo’s table and
 signor pastrini. truth compelled franz, spite dislike
 seemed taken count, confess advantage was
 pastrini’s side. dessert, servant inquired what
 time wished carriage. albert franz looked each
 other, fearing really abuse count’s kindness. servant
 understood them.
 
“his excellency count monte cristo had,” said, “given
 positive orders carriage remain lordships’
 orders day, therefore dispose without fear of
 indiscretion.”
 
resolved profit count’s courtesy, ordered horses
 harnessed, substituted evening dress which

 entered, motioned franz assume seat honor.
 albert, turn, sat behind.
 
“well,” said she, hardly giving franz time sit down, “it seems you
 nothing better make acquaintance new

“without far advanced that, dear countess,” returned
 franz, “i deny abused good nature day.”
 
“all day?”
 
“yes; morning breakfasted him; rode carriage all

“you know him, then?”
 
“yes, no.”
 
“how so?”
 
“it long story.”

“it frighten much.”
 
“so much reason.”
 
“at least wait story conclusion.”
 
“very well; prefer complete histories; tell made his

“no, name island purchased.”
 
“and count?”
 
“a tuscan count.”
 
“well, must put that,” said countess, herself

“ask vicomte morcerf.”
 
“you hear, m. morcerf, referred you,” said countess.
 
“we hard please, madam,” returned albert, “did not

“come,” observed countess, smiling, “i see vampire some

“her?”

“the beautiful greek yesterday.”
 
“no; heard, think, sound _guzla_, remained

“when say invisible,” interrupted albert, “it keep up
 mystery; take blue domino window with
 white curtains?”
 
“where window white hangings?” asked countess.
 
“at rospoli palace.”
 
“the count three windows rospoli palace?”
 
“yes. pass corso?”
 
“yes.”
 
“well, notice two windows hung yellow damask, one with
 white damask red cross? count’s windows.”
 
“why, must nabob. know three windows were

“two three hundred roman crowns?”
 
“two three thousand.”
 
“the deuce!”
 
“does island produce revenue?”
 
“it bring bajocco.”
 
“then purchase it?”
 
“for whim.”
 
“he original, then?”
 
“in reality,” observed albert, “he seemed somewhat eccentric;
 paris, frequenter theatres, say was
 poor devil literally mad. morning made two three exits
 worthy didier anthony.”
 
moment fresh visitor entered, and, according custom, franz
 gave seat him. circumstance had, moreover, effect of
 changing conversation; hour afterwards two friends returned
 hotel.
 
signor pastrini already set procuring disguises the
 morrow; assured perfectly satisfied. the
 next morning, nine o’clock, entered franz’s room, followed a
 tailor, eight ten roman peasant costumes arm; they
 selected two exactly alike, charged tailor sew of

 great advantage; bound scarf around waist, and

“gentlemen,” said he, “although companion agreeable, perfect
 freedom sometimes still agreeable. come say today,

albert let pressed just long friendship required, and

franz albert received morning invitation the

“take care, albert,” said franz. “all nobility rome will be

“whether goes not, opinion still same,” returned
 albert. “you read letter?”
 
“yes.”
 
“you know imperfectly women _mezzo cito_ educated in

“yes.”
 
“well, read letter again. look writing, find can,

count learned two friends sent secure box at

“ah, know already,” said private secretary, smiling and
 shaking hands him.
 
“_pardieu!_”
 
“and say world?”
 
“in world? many worlds year grace 1838.”
 
“in entire political world, one leaders.”
 
“they say quite fair, sowing much red, ought

“come, come, bad!” said lucien. “why join our

“i await one thing following advice; is, a

“a gentleman, diplomatist.”
 
“then shall wait two hours gentleman, three for

“do anything sort; gentleman montmorency,

“morrel,” muttered albert—“morrel—who he?”

“what done?” asked albert.
 
“oh, nothing worth speaking of,” said morrel; “m. château-renaud
 exaggerates.”
 
“not worth speaking of?” cried château-renaud; “life worth
 speaking of!—that rather philosophical, word, morrel. it
 well you, risk life every day, me, who
 once——”
 
“we gather this, baron, captain morrel saved life.”
 
“exactly so.”
 
“on occasion?” asked beauchamp.
 
“beauchamp, good fellow, know starving,” said debray: “do
 set long story.”
 
“well, prevent sitting table,” replied beauchamp,
 “château-renaud can tell us eat breakfast.”

“oh, m. morcerf,” interrupted morrel.
 
“let go on, captain. just heard,” continued albert, “of

 incredulous, “you always carry drug you?”
 
“always.”

“this magnificent emerald, largest ever seen,” said
 château-renaud, “although mother remarkable family jewels.”
 
“i three similar ones,” returned monte cristo. “i gave one the

“and two sovereigns give exchange these

“the sultan, liberty woman,” replied count; “the pope, the

“and peppino saved, not?” cried morcerf; “it for

“perhaps,” returned count, smiling.
 
“my dear count, idea pleasure gives hear you

monte cristo already seen breakfast-room salon the

 said, favorite apartment. monte cristo quickly appreciated all
 albert collected here—old cabinets, japanese porcelain,
 oriental stuffs, venetian glass, arms parts the
 world—everything familiar him; first glance he
 recognized date, country, origin.
 
morcerf expected guide; contrary, he

 like angels women features virgin; sketches torn from
 album dauzats’ “travels east,” made a
 seconds saddle camel, beneath dome a
 mosque—in word, modern art can give exchange as
 recompense art lost gone ages long since past.
 
albert expected something new time show the
 traveller, but, great surprise, latter, without seeking for
 signatures, many which, indeed, initials, named
 instantly author every picture manner easy
 see name known him, style
 associated appreciated studied him. the
 salon passed bedchamber; model taste and
 simple elegance. single portrait, signed léopold robert, shone in
 carved gilded frame. portrait attracted count monte
 cristo’s attention, made three rapid steps chamber, and
 stopped suddenly it.

 doubtless—becomes admirably.”
 
“ah, monsieur,” returned albert, “i never forgive this

“i believe it; thing impossible.”
 
“i assure you, madame,” replied woman, “it said.”
 
turning impatiently towards husband, madame danglars demanded, “is

“is true, madame?” inquired danglars, visibly agitated.
 
“what maid tells me.”
 
“but tell you?”
 
“that coachman harness horses carriage,

“be kind enough, madame, listen me,” said danglars.
 
“oh, yes; will listen, monsieur, curious hear what

 but, first, will state case them. gentlemen,” continued the
 baroness, “among ten horses stables baron danglars, are

“great heavens?” suddenly exclaimed debray.
 
“what it?” asked baroness.
 
“i mistaken; horses! animals were

“my dappled grays?” demanded baroness, springing window.
 “’tis indeed they!” said she.
 
danglars looked absolutely stupefied.
 
“how singular,” cried monte cristo well-feigned astonishment.
 
“i believe it,” murmured banker. madame danglars whispered a

 “the baroness wishes know paid husband horses.”
 
“i scarcely know,” replied count; “it little surprise

debray conveyed count’s reply baroness. poor danglars looked
 crest-fallen discomfited monte cristo assumed pitying air
 towards him.
 
“see,” said count, “how ungrateful women are. kind
 attention, providing safety baroness disposing of

“i thought mistake. lasso stop ox?”
 
ali repeated affirmative gesture.
 
“or tiger?”

“a lion even?”

 said count, carefully examining child, “but assure there

“unknown say, man rendered service—unknown to

 politeness admits curiosity requires.
 
“what sister valentine doing?” inquired madame villefort of
 edward; “tell someone bid come here, may honor
 introducing count.”
 
“you daughter, then, madame?” inquired count; “very young, i
 presume?”
 
“the daughter m. villefort first marriage,” replied the
 young wife, “a fine well-grown girl.”
 
“but melancholy,” interrupted master edward, snatching feathers out

madame villefort merely cried, “be still, edward!” added,
 “this young madcap is, however, nearly right, merely re-echoes

“because looking found.”
 
“and looking her?”
 
“with grandpapa noirtier.”
 
“and think there?”
 
“no, no, no, no, no, there,” replied edward, singing his

“and she, then? know, don’t tell?”
 
“she big chestnut-tree,” replied spoiled brat, he

“mademoiselle villefort, step-daughter,” said madame villefort
 monte cristo, leaning back sofa motioning towards
 valentine hand.
 
“and m. monte cristo, king china, emperor cochin-china,” said

“but, madame,” replied count, continuing conversation, and

“i think likely, sir; mademoiselle villefort very

“then society met mademoiselle yourself,

 interesting boy chasing beautiful peacock garden, you,
 madame, trellis arbor. pray come aid,
 madame; circumstances appeal memory?”
 
“no, indeed,” replied madame villefort; “and yet appears me,
 sir, met anywhere, recollection must have
 imprinted memory.”
 
“perhaps count saw us italy,” said valentine timidly.
 
“yes, italy; italy probably,” replied monte cristo;
 “you travelled italy, mademoiselle?”
 
“yes; madame two years ago. doctors, anxious for
 lungs, prescribed air naples. went bologna,
 perugia, rome.”
 
“ah, yes—true, mademoiselle,” exclaimed monte cristo simple
 explanation sufficient revive recollection sought. “it

 postes, chance brought us together; you, madame villefort, and
 son; now remember honor meeting you.”
 
“i perfectly well remember perugia, sir, hôtel des postes, and
 festival speak,” said madame villefort, “but in

“it strange, neither recollect meeting you,” observed
 valentine, raising beautiful eyes count.

“but remember perfectly,” interposed darling edward.
 
“i will assist memory, madame,” continued count; “the day had

 consequence festival. mademoiselle walking shade of

“and caught it, mamma, don’t remember?” interposed edward, “and i
 pulled three beautiful feathers tail.”
 
“you, madame, remained arbor; remember, while

“yes, truth, yes,” answered young lady, turning red, “i do

“precisely so, madame; man myself; fortnight been

“yes, true,” replied madame villefort, somewhat uneasily, “i

“i recollect now various subjects we
 discoursed, madame,” continued count perfect calmness; “but i
 perfectly remember that, falling error others had

“yes, really, sir, fact medical man,” said madame de
 villefort, “since cured sick.”
 
“molière beaumarchais reply you, madame, was

“it six o’clock,” said madame villefort, evidently agitated.
 “valentine, will go see grandpapa will his

valentine rose, saluting count, left apartment without

“oh, madame,” said count, valentine left room, “was it
 account sent mademoiselle villefort away?”
 
“by means,” replied young lady quickly; “but hour
 usually give m. noirtier unwelcome meal sustains his
 pitiful existence. aware, sir, deplorable condition of
 husband’s father?”
 
“yes, madame, m. villefort spoke me—a paralysis, think.”
 
“alas, yes; poor old gentleman entirely helpless; mind alone
 still active human machine, faint and
 flickering, like light lamp expire. excuse me,
 sir, talking domestic misfortunes; interrupted the
 moment telling skilful chemist.”
 
“no, madame, say much that,” replied count a
 smile; “quite contrary. studied chemistry because, having
 determined live eastern climates desirous of
 following example king mithridates.”
 
“_mithridates, rex ponticus_,” said young scamp, tore some
 beautiful portraits splendid album, “the individual took
 cream cup poison every morning breakfast.”
 
“edward, naughty boy,” exclaimed madame villefort, snatching the
 mutilated book urchin’s grasp, “you positively past

 sister valentine dear grandpapa noirtier’s room.”
 
“the album,” said edward sulkily.
 
“what mean?—the album!”
 
“i want album.”
 
“how dare tear drawings?”
 
“oh, amuses me.”
 
“go—go once.”
 
“i won’t go unless give album,” said boy, seating
 doggedly armchair, according habit never giving

“take it, then, pray disturb us longer,” said madame de
 villefort, giving album edward, went towards door,

“let us see shuts door him,” muttered.
 
madame villefort closed door carefully child, the

“oh, sometimes severity quite necessary,” replied madame de

“brucine extracted false angostura8 not?” inquired
 madame villefort.
 
“precisely, madame,” replied monte cristo; “but perceive not

 madame villefort tone reflection, “and always considered

“and more, madame,” said monte cristo, “as orientals not

“oh, yes, indeed, madame,” continued monte cristo, “the secret dramas

“ah, madame, mankind ever lose anything? arts change about

“were objects art, madame, nothing more,” replied count. “do

madame villefort appeared thoughtful.
 
“it fortunate,” observed, “that substances only
 prepared chemists; otherwise, world poisoning

“by chemists persons taste chemistry,” said monte
 cristo carelessly.
 
“and then,” said madame villefort, endeavoring struggle, and

 prepared, crime always crime, avoid human scrutiny, it

“yet conscience remains,” remarked madame villefort agitated

“yes,” answered monte cristo “happily, yes, conscience remain; and
 not, wretched be! every action requiring
 exertion, conscience saves us, supplies us a
 thousand good excuses, alone judges; reasons,

“well, free, too? prevents from

“oh, will great disappointment father not
 marry mademoiselle danglars.”
 
“marry then,” said count, significant shrug the
 shoulders.
 
“yes,” replied morcerf, “but will plunge mother positive
 grief.”
 
“then marry her,” said count.
 
“well, shall see. will try think best thing to
 done; will give advice, will not, possible

monte cristo turned away; seemed moved last remark.
 
“ah,” said debray, thrown easy-chair at
 farthest extremity salon, held pencil right
 hand account book left, “what there? are
 making sketch poussin?”
 
“oh, no,” tranquil response; “i fond art attempt
 anything sort. little sum arithmetic.”
 
“in arithmetic?”
 
“yes; calculating—by way, morcerf, indirectly concerns
 you—i calculating house danglars must gained the
 last rise haiti bonds; 206 risen 409 three
 days, prudent banker purchased 206; therefore must
 made 300,000 livres.”
 
“that biggest scoop,” said morcerf; “did make a
 million spaniards last year?”
 
“my dear fellow,” said lucien, “here count monte cristo, who
 will say you, italians do,—
 
“‘denaro santità,
 
metà della metà.’9
 

“when tell things, shrug shoulders say
 nothing.”
 
“but speaking haitians?” said monte cristo.
 
“ah, haitians,—that quite another thing! haitians _écarté_
 french stock-jobbing. may like bouillotte, delight whist, be
 enraptured boston, yet grow tired all; always
 come back _écarté_—it game, _hors-d’œuvre_! m.
 danglars sold yesterday 405, pockets 300,000 francs. but
 waited till today, price fallen 205, instead of
 gaining 300,000 francs, lost 20 25,000.”
 
“and caused sudden fall 409 206?” asked monte
 cristo. “i profoundly ignorant stock-jobbing
 intrigues.”
 
“because,” said albert, laughing, “one piece news follows another,
 often great dissimilarity them.”
 
“ah,” said count, “i see m. danglars accustomed play at
 gaining losing 300,000 francs day; must enormously rich.”
 
“it plays!” exclaimed lucien; “it madame danglars; she
 indeed daring.”
 
“but reasonable being, lucien, knows little
 dependence placed news, since the
 fountain-head, surely prevent it,” said morcerf, a
 smile.
 
“how can i, husband fails controlling her?” asked lucien;
 “you know character baroness—no one influence with
 her, precisely pleases.”
 
“ah, place——” said albert.
 
“well?”
 
“i reform her; rendering service future
 son-in-law.”
 
“how set it?”
 
“ah, easy enough—i give lesson.”
 
“a lesson?”
 
“yes. position secretary minister renders authority
 great subject political news; never open mouth but
 stockbrokers immediately stenograph words. cause lose a
 hundred thousand francs, teach prudence.”
 
“i understand,” stammered lucien.
 
“it clear, notwithstanding,” replied young man, an
 artlessness wholly free affectation; “tell fine morning
 unheard-of piece intelligence—some telegraphic despatch, which
 alone possession; instance, henri iv. seen
 yesterday gabrielle’s. boom market; will buy
 heavily, will certainly lose beauchamp announces the
 following day, gazette, ‘the report circulated usually
 well-informed persons king seen yesterday gabrielle’s
 house, totally without foundation. can positively assert his
 majesty quit pont-neuf.’”
 
lucien half smiled. monte cristo, although apparently indifferent, had
 lost one word conversation, penetrating eye had
 even read hidden secret embarrassed manner secretary.
 embarrassment completely escaped albert, caused lucien
 shorten visit; evidently ill ease. count, in
 taking leave him, said something low voice, he
 answered, “willingly, count; accept.” count returned young
 morcerf.
 
“do think, reflection,” said him, “that done
 wrong thus speaking mother-in-law presence m.

“my dear count,” said morcerf, “i beg apply title so

“now, speaking without exaggeration, mother really very
 much averse marriage?”
 
“so much baroness rarely comes house, my
 mother, not, think, visited madame danglars twice whole

 treated persecutors, conducted themselves
 towards deference due rank. finally, is
 anxious see fortunate enough escape bad

“sir!” exclaimed young man, quite astounded, “i hope false
 report——”
 
“as myself, first heard spoken friend wilmore, the
 philanthropist. believe found unpleasant position, but
 know nature, ask, inquisitive.
 misfortunes engaged sympathies, see must been
 interesting. told anxious restore the

 education, offence established forms etiquette, i
 suppose excused, consideration misfortunes which
 accompanied birth, followed youth.”
 
“well,” said monte cristo indifferent tone, “you will you

“i agree you, monsieur,” said young man, turning pale, and, in
 spite himself, trembling beneath scrutinizing look his
 companion, “such consequences extremely unpleasant.”
 
“nevertheless, must exaggerate evil,” said monte cristo,
 “for endeavoring avoid one fault will fall another. you
 must resolve upon one simple single line conduct, man

andrea visibly changed countenance.

“therefore,” said monte cristo feigning mistake his
 meaning—“therefore will not, another instant, retard pleasure

chapter 58. m. noirtier villefort
 
will now relate passing house king’s attorney
 departure madame danglars daughter, the
 time conversation maximilian valentine, we
 just detailed.
 
m. villefort entered father’s room, followed madame de
 villefort. visitors, saluting old man and
 speaking barrois, faithful servant, twenty-five years
 service, took places either side paralytic.
 
m. noirtier sitting armchair, moved upon casters, in
 wheeled room morning, way
 drawn night. placed large glass, which
 reflected whole apartment, so, without attempt move,
 impossible, see entered room
 everything going around him. m. noirtier, although
 almost immovable corpse, looked new-comers quick
 intelligent expression, perceiving once, ceremonious
 courtesy, come business unexpected official
 character.
 
sight hearing senses remaining, they, like two
 solitary sparks, remained animate miserable body seemed
 fit nothing grave; only, however, means one of
 senses reveal thoughts feelings still
 occupied mind, look gave expression his
 inner life like distant gleam candle traveller
 sees night across desert place, knows living being
 dwells beyond silence obscurity.
 
noirtier’s hair long white, flowed shoulders;
 eyes, shaded thick black lashes, concentrated, as
 often happens organ used exclusion the
 others, activity, address, force, intelligence were
 formerly diffused whole body; although movement of
 arm, sound voice, agility body, were
 wanting, speaking eye sufficed all. commanded it; it
 medium thanks conveyed. short, his
 whole appearance produced mind impression corpse with
 living eyes, nothing startling observe the
 expression anger joy suddenly lighting organs, the
 rest rigid marble-like features utterly deprived the
 power participation. three persons understand this
 language poor paralytic; villefort, valentine, and
 old servant already spoken. villefort saw
 father seldom, absolutely obliged, he
 never took pains please gratify there, all
 old man’s happiness centred granddaughter. valentine, by
 means love, patience, devotion, learned read
 noirtier’s look varied feelings passing his
 mind. dumb language, unintelligible others, she
 answered throwing whole soul expression her
 countenance, manner conversations sustained
 blooming girl helpless invalid, whose body could
 scarcely called living one, who, nevertheless, possessed a
 fund knowledge penetration, united will powerful as
 ever although clogged body rendered utterly incapable obeying
 impulses.
 
valentine solved problem, able easily understand his
 thoughts, convey return, and, untiring
 devoted assiduity, seldom that, ordinary transactions
 every-day life, failed anticipate wishes living,
 thinking mind, wants almost inanimate body.
 
servant, had, said, master for
 five-and-twenty years, therefore knew habits, was
 seldom noirtier found necessary ask anything, prompt
 administering necessities invalid.
 
villefort need help either valentine domestic in
 order carry father strange conversation was
 begin. said, perfectly understood old man’s
 vocabulary, use often, only
 indifference _ennui_ prevented doing. he
 therefore allowed valentine go garden, sent away barrois,
 seated father’s right hand, while
 madame villefort placed left, addressed thus:
 
“i trust will displeased, sir, valentine come
 us, dismissed barrois, conference will one
 propriety carried presence either.
 madame villefort communication make you.”
 
noirtier’s face remained perfectly passive long preamble,
 while, contrary, villefort’s eye endeavoring penetrate
 inmost recesses old man’s heart.
 
“this communication,” continued procureur, cold and
 decisive tone seemed preclude discussion, “will,
 sure, meet approbation.”
 
eye invalid still retained vacancy expression which
 prevented obtaining knowledge feelings which
 passing mind; listened, nothing more.
 
“sir,” resumed villefort, “we thinking marrying valentine.” had
 old man’s face moulded wax shown less
 emotion news now traced there. “the marriage
 will take place less three months,” said villefort.
 
noirtier’s eye still retained inanimate expression.
 
madame villefort now took part conversation added:
 
“we thought news possess interest you, sir, have
 always entertained great affection valentine; therefore only
 now remains us tell name young man she
 destined. one desirable connections could
 possibly formed; possesses fortune, high rank society, and
 every personal qualification likely render valentine supremely
 happy,—his name, moreover, wholly unknown you. m.
 franz quesnel, baron d’Épinay.”
 
wife speaking, villefort narrowly watched old
 man’s countenance. madame villefort pronounced name of
 franz, pupil m. noirtier’s eye began dilate, eyelids
 trembled movement may perceived lips an
 individual speak, darted lightning glance madame
 villefort son. procureur, knew political hatred
 formerly existed m. noirtier elder d’Épinay,
 well understood agitation anger announcement had
 produced; but, feigning perceive either, immediately resumed
 narrative begun wife.
 
“sir,” said he, “you aware valentine enter her
 nineteenth year, renders important lose no
 time forming suitable alliance. nevertheless, been
 forgotten plans, fully ascertained beforehand that
 valentine’s future husband will consent, live house, for
 might pleasant young people, should
 live them; valentine, attached each
 other, separated, able pursue exactly
 course life hitherto done, thus, instead
 losing, will gainer change, will secure you
 two children instead one, watch comfort you.”

noirtier’s look furious; evident something
 desperate passing old man’s mind, cry anger and
 grief rose throat, able find vent utterance,
 appeared almost choke him, face lips turned quite purple
 struggle. villefort quietly opened window, saying, “it is
 warm, heat affects m. noirtier.” returned his
 place, sit down.
 
“this marriage,” added madame villefort, “is quite agreeable the
 wishes m. d’Épinay family; besides, relations
 nearer uncle aunt, mother died birth, and
 father assassinated 1815, say, he
 two years old; naturally followed child was
 permitted choose pursuits, has, therefore, seldom
 acknowledged authority will.”
 
“that assassination mysterious affair,” said villefort, “and the
 perpetrators hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has
 fallen head one person.”
 
noirtier made effort lips expanded smile.
 
“now,” continued villefort, “those guilt really belongs, by
 crime committed, whose heads justice man may
 probably descend here, certain judgment god hereafter, would
 rejoice opportunity thus afforded bestowing a
 peace-offering valentine whose life so
 ruthlessly destroyed.” noirtier succeeded mastering emotion
 deemed possible enfeebled and
 shattered frame.
 
“yes, understand,” reply contained look; look
 expressed feeling strong indignation, mixed profound
 contempt. villefort fully understood father’s meaning, answered
 slight shrug shoulders. motioned wife to
 take leave.
 
“now sir,” said madame villefort, “i must bid farewell. would
 like send edward short time?”
 
agreed old man express approbation by
 closing eyes, refusal winking several times, he
 desire feeling express, raised heaven. he
 wanted valentine, closed right eye only, barrois, the
 left. madame villefort’s proposition instantly winked his
 eyes.
 
provoked complete refusal, bit lip said, “then shall i
 send valentine you?” old man closed eyes eagerly, thereby
 intimating wish.
 
m. madame villefort bowed left room, giving orders that
 valentine summoned grandfather’s presence, feeling
 sure much restore calmness the
 perturbed spirit invalid. valentine, color still
 heightened emotion, entered room just parents had
 quitted it. one look sufficient tell grandfather

“dear grandpapa,” cried she, “what happened? vexed you,
 angry?”
 
paralytic closed eyes token assent.
 
“who displeased you? father?”
 
“no.”
 
“madame villefort?”
 
“no.”
 
“me?” former sign repeated.
 
“are displeased me?” cried valentine astonishment. m.
 noirtier closed eyes.
 
“and done, dear grandpapa, angry with
 me?” cried valentine.
 
answer, continued:
 
“i seen day. anyone speaking against
 me?”
 
“yes,” said old man’s look, eagerness.
 
“let think moment. assure you, grandpapa—ah—m. madame de
 villefort just left room, not?”
 
“yes.”
 
“and told something made angry? was
 then? may go ask them, may opportunity of
 making peace you?”
 
“no, no,” said noirtier’s look.
 
“ah, frighten me. can said?” tried to
 think be.
 
“ah, know,” said she, lowering voice going close old
 man. “they speaking marriage,—have not?”
 
“yes,” replied angry look.
 
“i understand; displeased silence preserved on
 subject. reason was, insisted keeping
 matter secret, begged tell anything it. they
 even acquaint intentions, discovered
 chance, reserved you, dear
 grandpapa. pray forgive me.”
 
look calculated reassure her; seemed say
 was, “it reserve afflicts me.”
 
“what it, then?” asked young girl. “perhaps think shall
 abandon you, dear grandpapa, shall forget am
 married?”
 
“no.”
 
“they told you, then, m. d’Épinay consented living
 together?”
 
“yes.”
 
“then still vexed grieved?” old man’s eyes beamed
 expression gentle affection.
 
“yes, understand,” said valentine; “it love me.” the
 old man assented.
 
“and afraid shall unhappy?”
 
“yes.”
 
“you like m. franz?” eyes repeated several times, “no, no,
 no.”
 
“then vexed engagement?”
 
“yes.”
 
“well, listen,” said valentine, throwing knees, and
 putting arm round grandfather’s neck, “i vexed, too, i
 love m. franz d’Épinay.”
 
expression intense joy illumined old man’s eyes.
 
“when wished retire convent, remember angry you
 me?” tear trembled eye invalid. “well,”
 continued valentine, “the reason proposing might
 escape hateful marriage, drives despair.” noirtier’s
 breathing came thick short.
 
“then idea marriage really grieves too? ah, you
 help me—if together defeat plan! you
 unable oppose them,—you, whose mind quick, whose will
 firm nevertheless, weak unequal contest am
 myself. alas, you, powerful protector me
 days health strength, can now sympathize my
 joys sorrows, without able take active part them.
 however, much, calls gratitude heaven taken
 away blessings leaves sympathy kindness.”
 
words appeared noirtier’s eye expression such
 deep meaning young girl thought read words
 there: “you mistaken; can still much you.”
 
“do think can help me, dear grandpapa?” said valentine.
 
“yes.” noirtier raised eyes, sign agreed him
 valentine wanted anything.
 
“what want, dear grandpapa?” said valentine, she
 endeavored recall mind things likely to
 need; ideas presented mind, repeated
 aloud, then,—finding efforts elicited nothing a
 constant _“no,”_—she said, “come, since plan answer, i
 will recourse another.”
 
recited letters alphabet n. when

“ah,” said valentine, “the thing desire begins letter n;

 want begins n? na—ne—ni—no——”
 
“yes, yes, yes,” said old man’s eye.
 
“ah, no, then?”
 
“yes.”
 
valentine fetched dictionary, placed desk before
 noirtier; opened it, and, seeing old man’s eye was
 thoroughly fixed pages, ran finger quickly down
 columns. six years passed since noirtier first
 fell sad state, valentine’s powers invention too
 often put test render expert devising expedients

“good-morning, madame,” said count, bowing.
 


madame villefort acknowledged salutation one most

“what m. villefort telling me?” demanded monte

“incomprehensible word!” interrupted procureur, shrugging
 shoulders. “it old man’s caprice!”
 
“and means making revoke decision?”
 
“yes,” said madame villefort; “and still entirely power

“madame,” said villefort, “believe me, fortune 900,000 francs is
 easily renounced.”
 
“she could, nevertheless, make mind renounce world, sir,
 since year ago proposed entering a
 convent.”
 
“never mind,” replied villefort; “i say marriage _shall_ be

“notwithstanding father’s wishes contrary?” said madame de
 villefort, selecting new point attack. “that serious thing.”
 
monte cristo, pretended listening, heard however, every
 word said.

“madame,” replied villefort “i can truly say always

 daughter’s hand whomever please.”
 
“what?” said count, approbation whose eye villefort had
 frequently solicited speech. “what? say m.
 noirtier disinherits mademoiselle villefort going to
 marry m. baron franz d’Épinay?”
 
“yes, sir, reason,” said villefort, shrugging his
 shoulders.
 
“the apparent reason, least,” said madame villefort.
 
“the _real_ reason, madame, can assure you; know father.”
 
“but want know way m. d’Épinay can displeased your

“i believe know m. franz d’Épinay,” said count; “is the

“the same,” said villefort.
 
“well, charming young man, according ideas.”
 
“he is, makes believe excuse m. noirtier

 affection,” said madame villefort.
 
“but,” said monte cristo “do know cause hatred?”
 
“ah, _ma foi!_ know?”
 
“perhaps political difference?”
 
“my father baron d’Épinay lived stormy times i
 saw ending,” said villefort.
 
“was father bonapartist?” asked monte cristo; “i think i
 remember told something kind.”
 
“my father jacobin anything else,” said villefort,
 carried emotion beyond bounds prudence; “and the
 senator’s robe, napoleon cast shoulders, served to
 disguise old man without degree changing him. father
 conspired, emperor, bourbons; for
 m. noirtier possessed peculiarity, never projected utopian
 schemes never realized, strove possibilities,
 applied realization possibilities terrible
 theories mountain,—theories never shrank means
 deemed necessary bring desired result.”
 
“well,” said monte cristo, “it just thought; politics
 brought noirtier m. d’Épinay personal contact. although
 general d’Épinay served napoleon, still retain
 royalist sentiments? person assassinated one
 evening leaving bonapartist meeting invited
 supposition favored cause emperor?”
 
villefort looked count almost terror.

“no, sir, facts precisely stated,” said madame
 villefort; “and prevent renewal old feuds m.
 villefort formed idea uniting bonds affection the

“it sublime charitable thought,” said monte cristo, “and the
 whole world applaud it. noble see mademoiselle
 noirtier villefort assuming title madame franz d’Épinay.”
 
villefort shuddered looked monte cristo wished read
 countenance real feelings dictated words he
 just uttered. count completely baffled procureur, and
 prevented discovering anything beneath never-varying smile
 constantly habit assuming.
 
“although,” said villefort, “it will serious thing valentine

 frightened pecuniary loss. will, perhaps, hold in
 greater esteem money itself, seeing sacrifice

 valentine rich right mother, will, all
 probability, inherit fortune m. madame saint-méran, her
 mother’s parents, love tenderly.”
 
“and fully well worth loving tending m. noirtier,”

“true,” said madame villefort, intonation voice it
 impossible describe; “is unjust—shamefully unjust? poor
 edward much m. noirtier’s grandchild valentine, yet, if
 going marry m. franz, m. noirtier left
 money; supposing valentine disinherited her
 grandfather, will still three times richer he.”
 
count listened said more.
 
“count,” said villefort, “we will entertain longer our
 family misfortunes. true patrimony will go endow
 charitable institutions, father will deprived my
 lawful inheritance without reason so, shall have
 satisfaction knowing acted like man sense and
 feeling. m. d’Épinay, promised interest sum,

“however,” said madame villefort, returning one idea which
 incessantly occupied mind, “perhaps better explain
 unlucky affair m. d’Épinay, order give the
 opportunity renouncing claim hand mademoiselle
 villefort.”
 
“ah, great pity,” said villefort.
 
“a great pity,” said monte cristo.
 
“undoubtedly,” said villefort, moderating tones voice, “a
 marriage concerted broken off, throws sort discredit
 young lady; again, old reports, anxious to
 put end to, will instantly gain ground. no, will go well; m.
 d’Épinay, honorable man, will consider than

 decided feeling avarice, impossible.”
 
“i agree m. villefort,” said monte cristo, fixing eyes on
 madame villefort; “and sufficiently intimate to

 reached tower montlhéry, situated, everyone knows, upon the
 highest point plain name. foot hill the

 eighteen inches wide; reached summit found himself

 white flowers.
 
monte cristo looked entrance enclosure, long
 finding little wooden gate, working willow hinges, fastened
 nail string. count soon mastered mechanism, gate
 opened, found little garden, twenty feet
 long twelve wide, bounded one side part hedge, which
 contained ingenious contrivance called gate, the
 old tower, covered ivy studded wall-flowers.
 
one thought looking old, weather-beaten,

“excuse me, sir,” replied man, raising hand cap; “i am

“certainly, wrong,” said monte cristo, “but take into

“indeed, think not,” replied monte cristo; “dormice bad
 neighbors us eat preserved, romans did.”
 
“what? romans eat them?” said gardener—“ate dormice?”
 
“i read petronius,” said count.
 
“really? can’t nice, though say ‘as fat dormouse.’

“yes, isn’t contrary rules.”
 
“oh, no,” said gardener; “not least, since no

“that true, sir, like best,” said man,

“because responsibility. machine then, and
 nothing else, long work, nothing required me.”

“fifty-five years old.”
 
“how long must served claim pension?”
 
“oh, sir, twenty-five years.”
 
“and much pension?”

“none all.”
 
“and never tried understand them?”

“certainly.”
 
“and understand them?”
 
“they always same.”
 
“and mean——”
 
“‘_nothing new; hour;_’ ‘_tomorrow_.’”
 
“this simple enough,” said count; “but look, your

“once, sir, grafting rose-tree.”
 
“well, suppose alter signal, substitute another?”
 
“ah, another case; turned off, lose my

“three hundred francs?”
 
“a hundred crowns, yes, sir; see likely any

“not even fifteen years’ wages? come, worth thinking about?”
 
“for fifteen thousand francs?”
 
“yes.”
 
“sir, alarm me.”
 
“nonsense.”
 
“sir, tempting me?”
 
“just so; fifteen thousand francs, understand?”
 
“sir, let see right-hand correspondent.”
 
“on contrary, look him, this.”
 
“what it?”
 
“what? know bits paper?”

“sir, distracted me; shall fined.”
 
“that will cost hundred francs; see interest to

“i shall still place.”
 
“no, will lose it, going alter correspondent’s

“oh, sir, proposing?”
 
“a jest.”
 
“sir, unless force me——”
 
“i think can effectually force you;” monte cristo drew another

 “with fifteen thousand already pocket, will make
 twenty-five thousand. five thousand can buy pretty little
 house two acres land; remaining twenty thousand will bring
 thousand francs year.”
 
“a garden two acres land!”
 
“and thousand francs year.”
 
“oh, heavens!”
 
“come, take them,” monte cristo forced bank-notes his

“what do?”
 
“nothing difficult.”
 
“but it?”
 
“to repeat signs.” monte cristo took paper pocket,

“i think so,—a horse cost 5,000 francs!” said monte cristo,

“it seems me,” said danglars, coarse tone, ill-concealed a
 forced smile, “that already got horses enough.”
 
madame danglars seldom allowed remarks kind pass unnoticed,
 but, surprise young people, pretended hear it,
 said nothing. monte cristo smiled unusual humility, and
 showed two immense porcelain jars, wound marine plants,
 size delicacy nature alone produce. baroness
 astonished.
 
“why,” said she, “you plant one chestnut-trees the
 tuileries inside! can enormous jars manufactured?”
 
“ah! madame,” replied monte cristo, “you must ask us, the

“stay,” said debray; “i recognize hobbema.”
 
“ah, indeed!”
 
“yes; proposed museum.”

“no; yet refused buy it.”
 
“why?” said château-renaud.
 
“you pretend know,—because government rich enough.”
 
“ah, pardon me,” said château-renaud; “i heard things

“you fastidious, château-renaud,” replied debray; “those clothes

“that just find fault with. gentleman appears well

“who gentlemen?” asked danglars monte cristo.
 
“you heard—cavalcanti.”
 
“that tells name, nothing else.”
 
“ah! true. know italian nobility; cavalcanti all

“have fortune?”
 
“an enormous one.”

villefort complied, passed dining-room.
 


chapter 63. dinner
 
evident one sentiment affected guests entering
 dining-room. one asked strange influence brought them
 house, yet astonished, even uneasy though were, they
 still felt like absent. recent events,
 solitary eccentric position count, enormous, nay,
 almost incredible fortune, made men cautious, have
 altogether prevented ladies visiting house one of
 sex receive them; yet curiosity enough to
 lead overleap bounds prudence decorum.
 
present, even including cavalcanti son, notwithstanding
 stiffness one carelessness other, were
 thoughtful, finding assembled house this
 incomprehensible man. madame danglars started villefort, on
 count’s invitation, offered arm; villefort felt his
 glance uneasy beneath gold spectacles, felt arm of
 baroness press upon own. none escaped count,

 acquired considerable interest observer.
 
m. villefort right hand madame danglars, left
 morrel. count seated madame villefort danglars;
 seats filled debray, placed two
 cavalcanti, château-renaud, seated madame villefort
 morrel.
 
repast magnificent; monte cristo endeavored completely to
 overturn parisian ideas, feed curiosity much the
 appetite guests. oriental feast offered to
 them, kind arabian fairies might supposed to
 prepare. every delicious fruit four quarters globe
 provide heaped vases china jars japan. rare
 birds, retaining brilliant plumage, enormous fish, spread
 upon massive silver dishes, together every wine produced the

 grotesque shape seemed give additional flavor draught,—all
 these, like one displays apicius old gratified his
 guests, passed review eyes astonished parisians,
 understood possible expend thousand louis upon a
 dinner ten persons, condition eating pearls,
 like cleopatra, drinking refined gold, like lorenzo de’ medici.
 
monte cristo noticed general astonishment, began laughing and
 joking it.
 
“gentlemen,” said, “you will admit that, arrived certain
 degree fortune, superfluities life can be
 desired; ladies will allow that, risen a
 certain eminence position, ideal alone can exalted. now,

 see two fish; one brought fifty leagues beyond st.
 petersburg, five leagues naples. amusing to
 see table?”
 
“what two fish?” asked danglars.
 
“m. château-renaud, lived russia, will tell name of
 one, major cavalcanti, italian, will tell name of
 other.”
 
“this one is, think, sterlet,” said château-renaud.
 
“and one, mistake not, lamprey.”
 
“just so. now, m. danglars, ask gentlemen caught.”
 
“sterlets,” said château-renaud, “are found volga.”
 
“and,” said cavalcanti, “i know lake fusaro alone supplies
 lampreys size.”
 
“exactly; one comes volga, lake fusaro.”
 
“impossible!” cried guests simultaneously.
 
“well, just amuses me,” said monte cristo. “i like
 nero—_cupitor impossibilium_; amusing this
 moment. fish, seems exquisite you, likely no
 better perch salmon; seemed impossible procure it,
 is.”
 
“but fish brought france?”
 
“oh, nothing easy. fish brought cask—one filled
 river herbs weeds, rushes lake plants; they
 placed wagon built purpose, thus sterlet lived
 twelve days, lamprey eight, alive cook seized
 them, killing one milk wine. believe
 me, m. danglars!”
 
“i help doubting,” answered danglars stupid smile.
 
“baptistin,” said count, “have fish brought in—the
 sterlet lamprey came casks, are
 yet alive.”
 
danglars opened bewildered eyes; company clapped hands.
 four servants carried two casks covered aquatic plants, in
 breathing fish similar table.
 
“but two sort?” asked danglars.
 
“merely one might died,” carelessly answered monte cristo.
 
“you certainly extraordinary man,” said danglars; “and
 philosophers may well say fine thing rich.”
 
“and ideas,” added madame danglars.
 
“oh, give credit this, madame; done romans,

 alive, despised dead.”
 
“yes,” said debray, “but ostia leagues rome.”
 
“true,” said monte cristo; “but use living
 eighteen hundred years lucullus, can better he
 could?”
 
two cavalcanti opened enormous eyes, good sense
 say anything.
 
“all extraordinary,” said château-renaud; “still, i
 admire most, confess, marvellous promptitude which
 orders executed. true bought this
 house five six days ago?”
 
“certainly longer.”
 
“well, sure quite transformed since last week. remember
 rightly, another entrance, courtyard paved and
 empty; today splendid lawn, bordered trees which
 appear hundred years old.”
 
“why not? fond grass shade,” said monte cristo.
 
“yes,” said madame villefort, “the door towards road before,

“yes, madame,” said monte cristo; “but preferred entrance

“in four days,” said morrel; “it extraordinary!”
 
“indeed,” said château-renaud, “it seems quite miraculous make new
 house old one; old, dull too. recollect
 coming mother look m. saint-méran advertised it

“m. saint-méran?” said madame villefort; “then house
 belonged m. saint-méran bought it?”
 
“it appears so,” replied monte cristo.
 
“is possible know purchased it?”
 
“quite so; steward transacts business me.”
 
“it certainly ten years since house occupied,” said
 château-renaud, “and quite melancholy look it, the
 blinds closed, doors locked, weeds court. really, if
 house belonged father-in-law procureur, one
 might thought accursed place horrible crime had
 committed.”
 
villefort, hitherto tasted three four glasses of
 rare wine placed him, took one, drank it
 off. monte cristo allowed short time elapse, said:
 
“it singular, baron, idea came across first time
 came here; looked gloomy never bought my
 steward taken matter hands. perhaps fellow
 bribed notary.”
 
“it probable,” stammered villefort, trying smile; “but can
 assure nothing proceeding. this

 wished sell it; remained another year two

morrel’s turn become pale.
 
“there was, all, one room,” continued monte cristo, “very plain
 appearance, hung red damask, which, know why, appeared to
 quite dramatic.”
 
“why so?” said danglars; “why dramatic?”
 
“can account instinct?” said monte cristo. “are some
 places seem breathe sadness?—why, tell. a

monte cristo looked inquiringly guests. madame villefort

 seats; questioned vague stupid glances.
 
“did hear?” said madame danglars.
 
“we must go,” replied villefort, offering arm.

villefort became livid; madame danglars fell long seat placed
 near chimney.
 
“oh,” said madame villefort, smiling, “are courageous enough to

madame danglars rose suddenly.
 
“and then,” said monte cristo, “this all.”
 
“what more?” said debray, failed notice the

“ah, else there?” said danglars; “for, present, say

“ah,” said he, “we pisa, ugolino’s tower; ferrara, tasso’s

“what wicked-looking, crooked staircase,” said château-renaud a

“i know whether wine chios produces melancholy, but

“what matter?” asked debray, whisper, madame danglars.
 
“nothing,” replied violent effort. “i want air, is

“will come garden?” said debray, advancing towards the
 back staircase.
 
“no, no,” answered, “i rather remain here.”
 
“are really frightened, madame?” said monte cristo.
 
“oh, no, sir,” said madame danglars; “but suppose scenes a

“ah, yes,” said monte cristo smiling; “it matter of

“ah,” said monte cristo, taking hand.
 
“yes,” said, “at advice made trial.”
 
“and succeeded?”
 
“i think so.”

“what matter you, hermine? affected at

“because shocking spirits evening, my

“you deceived, lucien, assure you,” replied madame danglars; “and

“my study?”
 
“at least minister.”
 
“why so!”
 
“to ask engagement opera. really, never saw an

“go, cornélie,” said madame danglars, “i require any

cornélie obeyed, next minute madame danglars left room a

 reseated himself. noise door madame danglars turned
 round, looked upon husband astonishment took no
 trouble conceal.
 
“good-evening, madame,” said banker; “good-evening, m. debray.”
 
probably baroness thought unexpected visit signified desire

 dignified air, turned round debray, without answering her
 husband.
 
“read something, m. debray,” said. debray, slightly
 disturbed visit, recovered saw calmness of
 baroness, took book marked mother-of-pearl knife

“excuse me,” said banker, “but will tire yourself, baroness, by

“do think wish turn out, dear debray,” continued
 danglars; “oh, no, all. unexpected occurrence forces to
 ask wife little conversation me; rarely i
 make request, sure grudge me.”
 
debray muttered something, bowed went out, knocking against
 edge door, like nathan _athalie_.
 
“it extraordinary,” said, door closed behind him,
 “how easily husbands, ridicule, gain advantage over
 us.”
 
30241m
 


lucien left, danglars took place sofa, closed the
 open book, placing dreadfully dictatorial attitude, he
 began playing dog; animal, liking well as
 debray, attempting bite him, danglars seized skin of

 animal uttered cry transit, but, arrived its
 destination, crouched behind cushions, stupefied such
 unusual treatment remained silent motionless.
 
“do know, sir,” asked baroness, “that improving?
 generally rude, tonight brutal.”
 
“it worse humor usual,” replied danglars.
 hermine looked banker supreme disdain. glances
 frequently exasperated pride danglars, evening took
 notice them.
 
“and ill-humor?” said baroness,
 irritated impassibility husband; “do things concern
 me? keep ill-humor home money boxes, or, since have
 clerks pay, vent upon them.”
 
“not so,” replied danglars; “your advice wrong, shall not
 follow it. money boxes pactolus, as, think, m. demoustier
 says, will retard course, disturb calm. clerks

“and pray,” asked baroness, “am responsible loss?”
 
“why not?”
 
“is fault lost 700,000 francs?”
 
“certainly mine.”
 
“once all, sir,” replied baroness sharply, “i tell will

“oh, can well believe that, neither worth penny.”
 
“the better reason conversant slang the
 bank, dinning ears morning night; that

“really?” said danglars. “well, surprises me, thought you

“i? put idea head?”
 
“yourself.”
 
“ah?—what next?”

“when coming point?” cried baroness, shivering with

“patience, madame, coming it.”
 
“that’s fortunate.”
 
“in april went dine minister’s. heard private

“really, manner speaking——”
 
“it expresses meaning, want. well, three days

“well?”
 
“well, since gave fourth gains, think owe a

“what say absurd, see m. debray’s name mixed

“oh, much,” cried hermine, choking, “you worse than

“but,” continued danglars, “i find even pause there——”
 
“insults!”
 
“you right; let us leave facts alone, reason coolly. i

“a probable thing!”
 
“why not? ever heard occurrence this?—a false

“sir,” said baroness humbly, “are aware man

 proves either mad guilty? mistake.”
 
“yes, made fools laugh, caused minister a
 sleepless night, caused minister’s secretaries blacken

“but, sir,” said hermine suddenly, “if is, say, caused
 m. debray, why, instead going direct him, come tell
 it? why, accuse man, address woman?”
 
“do know m. debray?—do wish know him?—do wish know he
 gives advice?—do wish follow it?—do speculate? no; all
 this, i.”
 
“still seems me, profit it——”
 
danglars shrugged shoulders. “foolish creature,” exclaimed.
 “women fancy talent managed two three

 all, forbid ruin me.”
 
baroness tolerably composed name villefort
 pronounced; became pale, and, rising, if
 touched spring, stretched hands though conjuring an
 apparition; took two three steps towards husband, as
 though tear secret him, ignorant, which
 withheld odious calculation,—odious, his
 calculations were.
 
“m. villefort!—what mean?”
 
“i mean m. nargonne, first husband, neither a

madame danglars rooted spot; made violent effort to

 villefort, dinner scene, strange series misfortunes
 taken place house last days, and
 changed usual calm establishment scene scandalous

danglars even look her, though best faint. he
 shut bedroom door him, without adding another word, and
 returned apartments; madame danglars recovered her

“not nearly, indeed; exactly loss.”
 
“_diable!_” said monte cristo compassionately, “it hard blow a

“third-rate,” said danglars, rather humble, “what mean that?”
 
“certainly,” continued monte cristo, “i make three assortments in

“do think so?”
 
“i sure it.”
 
“and heard fortune mentioned?”

“i so, excused account madame morcerf being

“yes, yes,” said danglars, laughing, “it great deal of

“why so?”
 
“because air always breathed youth.”
 
monte cristo took notice ill-natured remark.
 
“but still, albert rich mademoiselle danglars,” said
 count, “you must allow fine name?”
 
“so has; like mine well.”
 
“certainly; name popular, honor title have

“and reason,” said danglars smile, tried

“still, think morcerfs yield cavalcanti?”
 
“the morcerfs!—stay, dear count,” said danglars; “you man of

“i think so.”
 
“and understand heraldry?”
 
“a little.”
 
“well, look coat-of-arms, worth morcerf’s.”

“a proof great humility great pride,” said monte cristo.
 
“well, clerk, morcerf mere fisherman.”
 
“and called——”
 
“fernand.”
 
“only fernand?”
 
“fernand mondego.”
 
“you sure?”
 
“_pardieu!_ bought enough fish know name.”
 
“then, think giving daughter him?”

“what can mean?” asked madame danglars, shuddering.
 
“i mean m. monte cristo, digging underneath trees, found

“neither there?” repeated madame danglars, staring,
 wide-open eyes expressing alarm. “neither there!” again
 said, though striving impress meaning the

“just god, avenging god!” murmured madame danglars.
 
villefort’s answer stifled groan.
 
“but child—the child, sir?” repeated agitated mother.
 
“how searched him,” replied villefort, wringing hands;
 “how called long sleepless nights; longed

“but inquired woman; traced

“ah! you, baron?” said he.
 
“why call baron?” said danglars; “you know care
 nothing title. like you, viscount; like title,

“certainly,” replied albert, “seeing without title be
 nothing; you, sacrificing baron, still remain the
 millionaire.”
 
“which seems finest title royalty july,” replied
 danglars.
 
“unfortunately,” said monte cristo, “one’s title millionaire does
 last life, like baron, peer france, academician;

“indeed?” said danglars, becoming pale.
 
“yes; received news evening courier. a

“ah, _mon dieu!_” exclaimed danglars, “they drawn for

“well, can throw draft; signature worth five per

“yes, late,” said danglars, “i honored bills.”
 
“then,” said monte cristo, “here 200,000 francs gone after——”
 
“hush, mention things,” said danglars; then, approaching
 monte cristo, added, “especially young m. cavalcanti;” after

mercédès smiled sadly.
 
“approach him,” said she, “and next waiter passes, insist upon

“but why, mother?”
 
“just please me, albert,” said mercédès. albert kissed mother’s
 hand, drew near count. another salver passed, loaded like the

“it warm room, not, count?” asked.
 
“yes, madame; excellent idea open doors

“do know leading you?” said countess, without

“no, madame,” replied monte cristo; “but see make resistance.”

 stepped back.
 
“do refuse?” said mercédès, tremulous voice.
 
“pray excuse me, madame,” replied monte cristo, “but never eat

mercédès let fall, sighed. magnificent peach hanging

 mercédès drew near, plucked fruit.
 
“take peach, then,” said. count refused. “what,

 stifle sob; “really, pain me.”
 
long silence followed; peach, like grapes, fell the
 ground.
 
“count,” added mercédès supplicating glance, “there a
 beautiful arabian custom, makes eternal friends have

“i know it, madame,” replied count; “but france, not

“but,” said countess, breathlessly, eyes fixed monte

 friends, not?”
 
count became pale death, blood rushed heart, then
 rising, dyed cheeks crimson; eyes swam like of
 man suddenly dazzled.
 
“certainly, friends,” replied; “why be?”
 
answer little like one mercédès desired, turned
 away give vent sigh, sounded like groan. “thank

“sir,” suddenly exclaimed countess, walk continued
 ten minutes silence, “is true seen much,
 travelled far, suffered deeply?”
 
“i suffered deeply, madame,” answered monte cristo.
 
“but now happy?”
 
“doubtless,” replied count, “since one hears complain.”
 
“and present happiness, softened heart?”
 
“my present happiness equals past misery,” said count.
 
“are married?” asked countess.
 
“i, married?” exclaimed monte cristo, shuddering; “who told

“no one told were, frequently seen the

“she slave bought constantinople, madame, daughter

“you live alone, then?”

 said, “and still preserved love heart—one can

“never.”
 
“never?”
 
“i never returned country lived.”
 
“to malta?”

“she is, then, now malta?”
 
“i think so.”
 
“and forgiven made suffer?”

“but her; still hate separated you?”
 
“i hate them? all; i?” countess placed herself

“take some,” said.
 
“madame, never eat muscatel grapes,” replied monte cristo, the
 subject mentioned before. countess dashed grapes

“inflexible man!” murmured. monte cristo remained unmoved if
 reproach addressed him.
 
albert moment ran in. “oh, mother,” exclaimed, “such a
 misfortune happened!”
 
“what? happened?” asked countess, though awakening from
 sleep realities life; “did say misfortune? indeed, i
 expect misfortunes.”
 
“m. villefort here.”
 
“well?”
 
“he comes fetch wife daughter.”
 
“why so?”
 
“because madame saint-méran just arrived paris, bringing the
 news m. saint-méran’s death, took place first stage

 mademoiselle valentine, first words, guessed whole truth,

“and m. saint-méran related mademoiselle villefort?”
 said count.
 
“he grandfather mother’s side. coming to
 hasten marriage franz.”
 
“ah, indeed!”
 
“so franz must wait. m. saint-méran also grandfather to
 mademoiselle danglars?”
 
“albert, albert,” said madame morcerf, tone mild reproof,
 “what saying? ah, count, esteems highly, tell him
 spoken amiss.”
 
took two three steps forward. monte cristo watched with
 air thoughtful, full affectionate admiration, she
 turned back grasped hand; time seized of
 son, joined together.
 
“we friends; not?” asked.
 
“oh, madame, presume call friend, all
 times respectful servant.” countess left an
 indescribable pang heart, taken ten steps the
 count saw raise handkerchief eyes.
 
“do mother agree?” asked albert, astonished.
 
“on contrary,” replied count, “did hear declare
 friends?”
 
re-entered drawing-room, valentine madame de
 villefort just quitted. perhaps needless add morrel
 departed almost time.
 


chapter 72. madame saint-méran
 
gloomy scene indeed just passed house m. villefort.
 ladies departed ball, whither entreaties
 madame villefort failed persuading accompany them,
 procureur shut study, according his
 custom, heap papers calculated alarm anyone else, but
 generally scarcely satisfied inordinate desires.
 
time papers mere matter form. villefort had
 secluded himself, study, reflect; door
 locked orders given disturbed excepting for
 important business, sat armchair began ponder
 events, remembrance last eight
 days filled mind many gloomy thoughts bitter
 recollections.
 
then, instead plunging mass documents piled him,
 opened drawer desk, touched spring, drew a
 parcel cherished memoranda, amongst carefully arranged,
 characters known himself, names who, either
 political career, money matters, bar, his
 mysterious love affairs, become enemies.
 
number formidable, now begun fear, yet
 names, powerful though were, often caused smile
 kind satisfaction experienced traveller from
 summit mountain beholds feet craggy eminences, the
 almost impassable paths, fearful chasms, has
 perilously climbed. run names his

 lists, shook head.
 
“no,” murmured, “none enemies waited patiently
 laboriously long space time, might now come

‘foul deeds will rise,
 
though earth o’erwhelm them, men’s eyes;’
 

but, like phosphoric light, rise mislead. story has
 told corsican priest, turn repeated

“but wish enlighten upon subject?” asked
 villefort, moment’s reflection, “what interest can m. de
 monte cristo m. zaccone,—son shipowner malta, discoverer of
 mine thessaly, now visiting paris first time,—what
 interest, say, can take discovering gloomy, mysterious, and
 useless fact like this? however, among incoherent details given
 abbé busoni lord wilmore, friend that
 enemy, one thing appears certain clear opinion—that no
 period, case, circumstance, any
 contact me.”
 
villefort uttered words even believe. he
 dreaded much revelation, reply deny its
 truth;—he cared little _mene, mene, tekel upharsin_, which
 appeared suddenly letters blood upon wall;—but was
 really anxious discover whose hand traced them. he
 endeavoring calm fears,—and instead dwelling upon the
 political future often subject ambitious
 dreams, imagining future limited enjoyments home, in
 fear awakening enemy long slept,—the noise a
 carriage sounded yard, heard steps aged person
 ascending stairs, followed tears lamentations, as
 servants always give vent wish appear interested in
 master’s grief.
 
drew back bolt door, almost directly old lady
 entered, unannounced, carrying shawl arm, bonnet in
 hand. white hair thrown back yellow forehead, and
 eyes, already sunken furrows age, now almost disappeared
 beneath eyelids swollen grief.
 
“oh, sir,” said; “oh, sir, misfortune! shall die it;
 oh, yes, shall certainly die it!”
 
then, falling upon chair nearest door, burst a
 paroxysm sobs. servants, standing doorway, daring to
 approach nearer, looking noirtier’s old servant, heard
 noise master’s room, run also, remaining behind
 others. villefort rose, ran towards mother-in-law, it
 she.
 
“why, can happened?” exclaimed, “what thus disturbed
 you? m. saint-méran you?”
 
“m. saint-méran dead,” answered old marchioness, without
 preface without expression; appeared stupefied. villefort
 drew back, clasping hands together, exclaimed:
 
“dead!—so suddenly?”
 
“a week ago,” continued madame saint-méran, “we went together in
 carriage dinner. m. saint-méran unwell some
 days; still, idea seeing dear valentine inspired him
 courage, notwithstanding illness leave. six
 leagues marseilles, eaten lozenges is
 accustomed take, fell deep sleep, appeared to

 person suffering dreams, suddenly threw head back
 violently. called valet, stopped postilion, spoke m.

villefort stood mouth half open, quite stupefied.
 
“of course sent doctor?”
 
“immediately; but, told you, late.”
 
“yes; tell complaint poor marquis had
 died.”
 
“oh, yes, sir, told me; appears apoplectic
 stroke.”
 
“and then?”
 
“m. saint-méran always expressed desire, case death
 happened absence paris, body might brought

“oh! poor mother!” said villefort, “to duties perform
 age blow!”
 
“god supported all; then, dear marquis, would
 certainly done everything performed him. is
 true since left him, seem lost senses. cannot
 cry; age say tears,—still think that
 one trouble one power weeping. is

villefort thought terrible reply valentine a
 ball; said gone step-mother, and
 fetched. “this instant, sir—this instant, beseech
 you!” said old lady. villefort placed arm madame de
 saint-méran within own, conducted apartment.
 
“rest yourself, mother,” said.
 
marchioness raised head word, beholding man who
 forcibly reminded deeply-regretted child, still lived
 valentine, felt touched name mother, and
 bursting tears, fell knees armchair, where
 buried venerable head. villefort left care the
 women, old barrois ran, half-scared, master; nothing
 frightens old people much death relaxes vigilance over
 moment order strike old person. then, while
 madame saint-méran remained knees, praying fervently,
 villefort sent cab, went fetch wife and
 daughter madame morcerf’s. pale appeared at
 door ball-room, valentine ran him, saying:
 
“oh, father, misfortune happened!”
 
“your grandmamma just arrived, valentine,” said m. villefort.
 
“and grandpapa?” inquired young girl, trembling apprehension.
 m. villefort replied offering arm daughter. it
 just time, valentine’s head swam, staggered; madame
 villefort instantly hastened assistance, aided her
 husband dragging carriage, saying:
 
“what singular event! thought it? ah, yes, is
 indeed strange!”
 
wretched family departed, leaving cloud sadness hanging
 rest evening. foot stairs, valentine
 found barrois awaiting her.
 
“m. noirtier wishes see tonight, said, undertone.
 
“tell will come leave dear grandmamma,” replied,
 feeling, true delicacy, person of
 service just madame saint-méran.
 
valentine found grandmother bed; silent caresses, heartwrung
 sobs, broken sighs, burning tears, passed sad
 interview, madame villefort, leaning husband’s arm,
 maintained outward forms respect, least towards poor
 widow. soon whispered husband:
 
“i think better retire, permission, for
 sight appears still afflict mother-in-law.” madame de
 saint-méran heard her.
 
“yes, yes,” said softly valentine, “let leave; you
 stay.”
 
madame villefort left, valentine remained alone beside bed,
 procureur, overcome astonishment unexpected death,
 followed wife. meanwhile, barrois returned first
 time old noirtier, heard noise house, had, as
 said, sent old servant inquire cause; return,
 quick intelligent eye interrogated messenger.
 
“alas, sir,” exclaimed barrois, “a great misfortune happened.
 madame saint-méran arrived, husband dead!”
 
m. saint-méran noirtier never strict terms of
 friendship; still, death one old man always considerably affects
 another. noirtier let head fall upon chest, apparently
 overwhelmed thoughtful; closed one eye, token of
 inquiry.
 
barrois asked, “mademoiselle valentine?”
 
noirtier nodded head.
 
“she ball, know, since came say good-bye you
 full dress.” noirtier closed left eye.
 
“do wish see her?” noirtier made affirmative sign.
 
“well, gone fetch her, doubt, madame morcerf’s;
 will await return, beg come here. you
 wish for?”
 
“yes,” replied invalid.
 
barrois, therefore, seen, watched valentine, and
 informed grandfather’s wish. consequently, valentine came up

 within reach hand placed small table upon stood a
 bottle orangeade, usual beverage, glass. then, have

valentine kissed old man, looked tenderness

 exhausted. old gentleman continued dwell upon same
 expression.
 
“yes, yes,” said valentine, “you mean yet kind
 grandfather left, not.” old man intimated his
 meaning. “ah, yes, happily have,” replied valentine. “without that,
 become me?”
 
one o’clock morning. barrois, wished go bed

 appear quite ill.
 
next morning found grandmother bed; fever not
 abated, contrary eyes glistened appeared be
 suffering violent nervous irritability.
 
“oh, dear grandmamma, worse?” exclaimed valentine, perceiving
 signs agitation.
 
“no, child, no,” said madame saint-méran; “but impatiently
 waiting arrival, might send father.”
 
“my father?” inquired valentine, uneasily.
 
“yes, wish speak him.”
 
valentine durst oppose grandmother’s wish, cause which
 know, instant afterwards villefort entered.
 
“sir,” said madame saint-méran, without using circumlocution,
 fearing time lose, “you wrote concerning
 marriage child?”
 
“yes, madame,” replied villefort, “it projected but
 arranged.”
 
“your intended son-in-law named m. franz d’Épinay?”
 
“yes, madame.”
 
“is general d’Épinay side, was
 assassinated days usurper returned island of

“the same.”
 
“does dislike idea marrying granddaughter a
 jacobin?”
 
“our civil dissensions now happily extinguished, mother,” said
 villefort; “m. d’Épinay quite child father died, he
 knows little m. noirtier, will meet him, with
 pleasure, least indifference.”
 
“is suitable match?”
 
“in every respect.”
 
“and young man?”
 
“is regarded universal esteem.”
 
“you approve him?”
 
“he one well-bred young men know.”
 
whole conversation valentine remained silent.
 
“well, sir,” said madame saint-méran, minutes’
 reflection, “i must hasten marriage, short time to
 live.”
 
“you, madame?” “you, dear mamma?” exclaimed m. villefort and
 valentine time.
 
“i know saying,” continued marchioness; “i must hurry

“a stepmother never mother, sir. the
 purpose,—our business concerns valentine, let us leave dead in

said exceeding rapidity, was
 something conversation seemed like beginning of
 delirium.
 
“it shall wish, madame,” said villefort; “more especially
 since wishes coincide mine, soon m. d’Épinay
 arrives paris——”
 
30319m
 


“my dear grandmother,” interrupted valentine, “consider decorum—the
 recent death. marry sad auspices?”
 
“my child,” exclaimed old lady sharply, “let us hear none the
 conventional objections deter weak minds preparing the
 future. also married death-bed mother, certainly
 less happy account.”
 
“still idea death, madame,” said villefort.
 
“still?—always! tell going die—do understand? well,
 dying, wish see son-in-law. wish tell make
 child happy; wish read eyes whether intends obey
 me;—in fact, will know him—i will!” continued old lady, a
 fearful expression, “that may rise depths grave to

“and tell you, sir, mistaken. night a

“but saw one?”
 
“phantoms visible see them. the

“oh, madame,” said villefort, deeply affected, spite himself, “do

“we expect every moment.”
 
“it well. soon arrives inform me. must expeditious.

“do seriously ask advice, valentine?”
 
“certainly, dear maximilian, good, will follow it; you

“valentine,” said morrel pushing aside loose plank, “give your

“i feared it, maximilian,” said she; “it counsel madman,

“you will submit fate decrees without even

“yes,—if die!”
 
“well, valentine,” resumed maximilian, “i can say you

valentine trembled convulsively; loosened hold gate, her
 arms fell side, two large tears rolled cheeks. the
 young man stood her, sorrowful resolute.
 
“oh, pity’s sake,” said she, “you will live, will not?”
 
“no, honor,” said maximilian; “but will affect you. you
 done duty, conscience will rest.”
 
valentine fell knees, pressed almost bursting heart.
 “maximilian,” said she, “maximilian, friend, brother earth, my
 true husband heaven, entreat you, do, live suffering;
 perhaps may one day united.”
 
“adieu, valentine,” repeated morrel.

morrel, already gone steps away, returned, and
 pale joy extended hands towards valentine the
 opening.
 
“valentine,” said he, “dear valentine, must speak thus—rather
 let die. obtain violence, love mutual?
 mere humanity bid live? rather die.”
 
“truly,” murmured valentine, “who earth cares me, he
 not? consoled sorrow he? hopes

 paternal home, will give all. oh, ungrateful girl am,”
 cried valentine, sobbing, “i will give all, even dear old
 grandfather, nearly forgotten.”
 
“no,” said maximilian, “you shall leave him. m. noirtier has

“oh, see, maximilian, see power me, almost make

“yes, promise you, faithfully promised this

“i promise sacred world, namely,

“we will wait, then,” said morrel.
 
“yes, will wait,” replied valentine, revived words;
 “there many things may save unhappy beings we

“i rely you, valentine,” said morrel; “all will well done;

“then promise, maximilian.”
 
“instead signing——”
 
“i will go you, will fly; moment then,

“you right, valentine; shall ascertain?”
 
“from notary, m. deschamps.”
 
“i know him.”
 
“and myself—i will write you, depend me. dread this

“yes,” said valentine, “i will now acknowledge right,
 maximilian; now satisfied betrothal?” said the
 young girl sorrowfully.
 
“my adored valentine, words express one half my
 satisfaction.”
 
valentine approached, rather, placed lips near the
 fence, nearly touched morrel, pressed
 side cold inexorable barrier.
 
“adieu, then, till meet again,” said valentine, tearing herself
 away. “i shall hear you?”
 
“yes.”
 
“thanks, thanks, dear love, adieu!”

afternoon arrived felt hour drawing near,

length hour drew near. never man deeply love allow the
 clocks go peacefully. morrel tormented effectually that

 signature indeed fixed take place nine o’clock, but
 perhaps valentine will wait that.” consequently, morrel, having
 left rue meslay half-past eight timepiece, entered the
 clover-field clock saint-philippe-du-roule striking
 eight. horse cabriolet concealed behind small ruin,
 morrel often waited.
 
night gradually drew on, foliage garden assumed a
 deeper hue. morrel came hiding-place beating
 heart, looked small opening gate; yet
 one seen.
 
clock struck half-past eight, still another half-hour was
 passed waiting, morrel walked fro, gazed and
 frequently opening. garden became darker still,
 darkness looked vain white dress, the
 silence vainly listened sound footsteps. house, which
 discernible trees, remained darkness, gave no
 indication important event signature a
 marriage-contract going on. morrel looked watch, which
 wanted quarter ten; soon clock already heard
 strike two three times rectified error striking half-past
 nine.
 
already half hour past time valentine fixed. was
 terrible moment young man. slightest rustling the
 foliage, least whistling wind, attracted attention, and
 drew perspiration brow; tremblingly fixed his
 ladder, and, lose moment, placed foot first step.
 amidst alternations hope fear, clock struck ten.
 “it impossible,” said maximilian, “that signing contract

 weighed chances, calculated time required the

walked rapidly fro, pressed burning forehead

 possible young man.
 
idea strength failed attempting escape, and
 fainted one paths, one most
 impressed upon mind. “in case,” said he, “i lose

 appeared reality. even thought perceive something the

last half-hour struck. impossible wait longer, his
 temples throbbed violently, eyes growing dim; passed one

 might consequences? however, ventured thus far to
 draw back. followed short distance close wall, then
 crossed path, hid entered clump trees. moment passed

morrel saw right believing house was
 illuminated. instead lights every window, customary on
 days ceremony, saw gray mass, veiled also a
 cloud, moment obscured moon’s feeble light. light
 moved rapidly time time past three windows second floor.
 three windows madame saint-méran’s room. another
 remained motionless behind red curtains madame de
 villefort’s bedroom. morrel guessed this. many times, order
 follow valentine thought every hour day, made
 describe whole house, without seen knew it
 all.
 
darkness silence alarmed morrel still valentine’s
 absence done. almost mad grief, determined venture
 everything order see valentine more, certain the
 misfortune feared, morrel gained edge clump trees, and
 going pass quickly possible flower-garden,
 sound voice, still distance, borne
 upon wind, reached him. sound, already partially
 exposed view, stepped back concealed completely,
 remaining perfectly motionless.
 
formed resolution. valentine alone, speak
 passed; accompanied, speak, still he
 see her, know safe; strangers, he
 listen conversation, might understand something of
 hitherto incomprehensible mystery.
 
moon just escaped behind cloud had
 concealed it, morrel saw villefort come upon steps,
 followed gentleman black. descended, advanced towards
 clump trees, morrel soon recognized gentleman as
 doctor d’avrigny.
 
30339m
 


young man, seeing approach, drew back mechanically, he
 found stopped sycamore-tree centre clump;
 compelled remain. soon two gentlemen stopped also.
 
“ah, dear doctor,” said procureur, “heaven declares itself
 house! dreadful death—what blow! seek to
 console me; alas, nothing can alleviate great sorrow—the wound is
 deep fresh! dead, dead!”
 
cold sweat sprang young man’s brow, teeth chattered.
 dead house, villefort called
 accursed?
 
“my dear m. villefort,” replied doctor, tone which
 redoubled terror young man, “i led to
 console you; contrary——”
 
“what can mean?” asked procureur, alarmed.
 
“i mean behind misfortune just happened you,
 another, perhaps, still greater.”
 
“can possible?” murmured villefort, clasping hands. “what are
 going tell me?”
 
“are quite alone, friend?”
 
“yes, quite; precautions?”
 
“because terrible secret communicate you,” said the
 doctor. “let us sit down.”
 
villefort fell, rather seated himself. doctor stood before
 him, one hand placed shoulder. morrel, horrified, supported
 head one hand, pressed heart, lest its
 beatings heard. “dead, dead!” repeated within himself; and
 felt also dying.
 
“speak, doctor—i listening,” said villefort; “strike—i prepared
 everything!”
 
“madame saint-méran was, doubtless, advancing years, she
 enjoyed excellent health.” morrel began breathe freely, which
 done last ten minutes.
 
“grief consumed her,” said villefort—“yes, grief, doctor! after
 living forty years marquis——”
 
“it grief, dear villefort,” said doctor; “grief may kill,
 although rarely does, never day, never hour, never in
 ten minutes.” villefort answered nothing, simply raised head,
 cast before, looked doctor with
 amazement.
 
“were present last struggle?” asked m. d’avrigny.
 
“i was,” replied procureur; “you begged leave.”
 
“did notice symptoms disease madame de
 saint-méran fallen victim?”
 
“i did. madame saint-méran three successive attacks, at
 intervals minutes, one serious former. when
 arrived, madame saint-méran already panting breath
 minutes; fit, took simply nervous
 attack, saw raise bed, and
 limbs neck appear stiffened, became really alarmed. then
 understood countenance fear had
 thought. crisis past, endeavored catch eye, could

 came turned towards me. terrible than
 first; nervous movements repeated, mouth
 contracted turned purple.”
 
“and third expired.”
 
“at end first attack discovered symptoms tetanus; you
 confirmed opinion.”
 
“yes, others,” replied doctor; “but now alone——”
 
“what going say? oh, spare me!”
 
“that symptoms tetanus poisoning vegetable substances are
 same.”
 
m. villefort started seat, moment fell down
 again, silent motionless. morrel knew dreaming or
 awake.
 
“listen,” said doctor; “i know full importance statement
 just made, disposition man made
 it.”
 
“do speak magistrate friend?” asked villefort.
 
“as friend, friend, moment. similarity in
 symptoms tetanus poisoning vegetable substances so
 great, obliged affirm oath now stated, i
 hesitate; therefore repeat you, speak a
 magistrate, friend. friend say, ‘during the
 three-quarters hour struggle continued, watched the
 convulsions death madame saint-méran, thoroughly
 convinced death proceed poison, could
 also specify poison.’”
 
“can possible?”
 
“the symptoms marked, see?—sleep broken nervous spasms,
 excitation brain, torpor nerve centres. madame de
 saint-méran succumbed powerful dose brucine strychnine,
 mistake, perhaps, given her.”
 
villefort seized doctor’s hand.
 
“oh, impossible,” said he, “i must dreaming! frightful
 hear things man you! tell me, entreat you, my
 dear doctor, may deceived.”
 
“doubtless may, but——”
 
“but?”
 
30345m
 


“but think so.”
 
“have pity doctor! many dreadful things happened me
 lately verge madness.”
 
“has anyone besides seen madame saint-méran?”
 
“no.”
 
“has anything sent chemist’s examined?”
 
“nothing.”
 
“had madame saint-méran enemies?”
 
“not knowledge.”
 
“would death affect anyone’s interest?”
 
“it indeed, daughter heiress—valentine alone.
 oh, thought present itself, stab to
 punish heart one instant harbored it.”
 
“indeed, dear friend,” said m. d’avrigny, “i accuse
 anyone; speak accident, understand,—of mistake,—but
 whether accident mistake, fact there; conscience
 compels speak aloud you. make inquiry.”
 
“of whom?—how?—of what?”
 
“may barrois, old servant, made mistake, given
 madame saint-méran dose prepared master?”
 
“for father?”
 
“yes.”
 
“but dose prepared m. noirtier poison madame de
 saint-méran?”
 
“nothing simple. know poisons become remedies certain
 diseases, paralysis one. instance, tried every
 remedy restore movement speech m. noirtier, resolved
 try one last means, three months giving him
 brucine; last dose ordered six
 grains. quantity, perfectly safe administer the
 paralyzed frame m. noirtier, become gradually accustomed

“my dear doctor, communication m. noirtier’s
 apartment madame saint-méran, barrois never entered
 mother-in-law’s room. short, doctor although know the
 conscientious man world, although place utmost
 reliance you, want, notwithstanding conviction, believe this
 axiom, _errare humanum est_.”
 
“is one brethren equal confidence with
 myself?”
 
“why ask that?—what wish?”
 
“send him; will tell seen, will consult
 together, examine body.”
 
“and will find traces poison?”
 
“no, say poison, can prove state of
 body; shall discover cause sudden death, shall
 say, ‘dear villefort, thing caused negligence,
 watch servants; hatred, watch enemies.’”
 
“what propose me, d’avrigny?” said villefort despair; “so
 soon another admitted secret, inquest will become
 necessary; inquest house—impossible! still,” continued the
 procureur, looking doctor uneasiness, “if wish it—if
 demand it, shall done. but, doctor, see me
 already grieved—how can introduce house much scandal,
 much sorrow? wife daughter die it! i,

 tolerable number enemies; mine numerous. let affair be
 talked of, will triumph them, will make rejoice,

 know mankind. doctor, pray recall words; said
 nothing, you?”
 
“my dear m. villefort,” replied doctor, “my first duty to
 humanity. saved madame saint-méran, science could
 done it; dead duty regards living. let us
 bury terrible secret deepest recesses hearts; am
 willing, anyone suspect this, silence subject
 imputed ignorance. meanwhile, sir, watch always—watch
 carefully, perhaps evil may stop here. have
 found culprit, find him, will say you, ‘you a
 magistrate, will!’”
 
“i thank you, doctor,” said villefort indescribable joy; “i never
 better friend you.” and, feared doctor d’avrigny
 recall promise, hurried towards house.
 
gone, morrel ventured trees, the
 moon shone upon face, pale might taken
 ghost.
 
“i manifestly protected wonderful, terrible
 manner,” said he; “but valentine, poor girl, will bear much
 sorrow?”
 
thought thus, looked alternately window red
 curtains three windows white curtains. light had
 almost disappeared former; doubtless madame villefort had
 just put lamp, nightlamp alone reflected dull light
 window. extremity building, contrary, he
 saw one three windows open. wax-light placed the
 mantle-piece threw pale rays without, shadow seen
 one moment balcony. morrel shuddered; thought heard a
 sob.
 
wondered mind, generally courageous, but
 now disturbed two strongest human passions, love fear, was
 weakened even indulgence superstitious thoughts. although it
 impossible valentine see him, hidden was, he
 thought heard shadow window call him; disturbed mind
 told so. double error became irresistible reality, by
 one incomprehensible transports youth, bounded his
 hiding-place, two strides, risk seen, the
 risk alarming valentine, risk discovered some
 exclamation might escape young girl, crossed the
 flower-garden, light moon resembled large white
 lake, passed rows orange-trees extended in

 sobbing, hands extended head, clasped stiff. had
 turned window, remained open, praying accents
 affected unfeeling; words rapid,
 incoherent, unintelligible, burning weight grief almost
 stopped utterance.
 
moon shining open blinds made lamp appear burn
 paler, cast sepulchral hue whole scene. morrel not
 resist this; exemplary piety, easily
 impressed, valentine suffering, weeping, wringing hands before
 him, bear silence. sighed, whispered a
 name, head bathed tears pressed velvet cushion of
 chair—a head like magdalen correggio—was raised and
 turned towards him. valentine perceived without betraying least
 surprise. heart overwhelmed one great grief insensible to
 minor emotions. morrel held hand her. valentine, only
 apology met him, pointed corpse sheet,
 began sob again.
 
neither dared time speak room. hesitated to
 break silence death seemed impose; length valentine
 ventured.
 
“my friend,” said she, “how came here? alas, say are
 welcome, death opened way house.”
 
“valentine,” said morrel trembling voice, “i waited since
 half-past eight, see come; became uneasy, leaped the
 wall, found way garden, voices conversing the
 fatal event——”
 
“what voices?” asked valentine. morrel shuddered thought the
 conversation doctor m. villefort, thought could
 see sheet extended hands, stiff neck, the
 purple lips.
 
“your servants,” said he, “who repeating whole the
 sorrowful story; learned all.”
 
“but risking failure plan come here, love.”
 
“forgive me,” replied morrel; “i will go away.”
 
“no,” said valentine, “you might meet someone; stay.”
 
“but anyone come here——”
 
young girl shook head. “no one will come,” said she; “do not
 fear, safeguard,” pointing bed.
 
“but become m. d’Épinay?” replied morrel.
 
30349m
 


“m. franz arrived sign contract just dear grandmother was
 dying.”
 
“alas,” said morrel feeling selfish joy; thought this
 death cause wedding postponed indefinitely.
 
“but redoubles sorrow,” continued young girl, this
 feeling receive immediate punishment, “is poor old
 lady, death-bed, requested marriage might take place as
 soon possible; also, thinking protect me, acting against
 me.”
 
“hark!” said morrel. listened; steps distinctly heard in
 corridor stairs.
 
“it father, just left study.”
 
“to accompany doctor door,” added morrel.
 
“how know doctor?” asked valentine, astonished.
 
“i imagined must be,” said morrel.
 
valentine looked young man; heard street door close,
 m. villefort locked garden door, returned upstairs. he
 stopped moment anteroom, hesitating whether turn to
 apartment madame saint-méran’s; morrel concealed
 behind door; valentine remained motionless, grief seeming to
 deprive fear. m. villefort passed room.
 
“now,” said valentine, “you can neither go front door by

 struck old man, immediately bright eye began to
 interrogate.
 
“dear grandfather.” said hurriedly, “you know poor grandmamma died
 hour since, now friend world you.”
 
expressive eyes evinced greatest tenderness.
 
“to alone, then, may confide sorrows hopes?”
 
paralytic motioned “yes.”
 
valentine took maximilian’s hand.
 
“look attentively, then, gentleman.”
 
old man fixed scrutinizing gaze slight astonishment on
 morrel.
 
“it m. maximilian morrel,” said she; “the good merchant
 marseilles, doubtless recollect.”
 
“yes,” said old man.
 
“he brings irreproachable name, maximilian likely render

old man signified recollected him.
 
“well, grandpapa,” said valentine, kneeling him, pointing to
 maximilian, “i love him, will his; compelled to
 marry another, destroy myself.”
 
eyes paralytic expressed multitude tumultuous thoughts.
 
“you like m. maximilian morrel, not, grandpapa?” asked
 valentine.
 
“yes.”
 
“and will protect us, children, will my
 father?”
 
noirtier cast intelligent glance morrel, say, “perhaps i
 may.”
 
maximilian understood him.
 
“mademoiselle,” said he, “you sacred duty fulfil your
 deceased grandmother’s room, will allow honor few
 minutes’ conversation m. noirtier?”
 
“that it,” said old man’s eye. looked anxiously at
 valentine.
 
“do fear will understand?”
 
“yes.”
 
“oh, often spoken you, knows exactly talk
 you.” turning maximilian, adorable smile; although
 shaded sorrow,—“he knows everything know,” said she.
 
valentine arose, placed chair morrel, requested barrois to
 admit anyone, tenderly embraced grandfather, and
 sorrowfully taken leave morrel, went away. prove noirtier
 valentine’s confidence knew secrets,
 morrel took dictionary, pen, paper, placed all
 table light.
 
“but first,” said morrel, “allow me, sir, tell am, how
 much love mademoiselle valentine, designs respecting
 her.”
 
noirtier made sign listen.
 
imposing sight witness old man, apparently mere
 useless burden, becoming sole protector, support, adviser of
 lovers young, beautiful, strong. remarkably
 noble austere expression struck morrel, began story with
 trembling. related manner become acquainted with
 valentine, loved her, valentine, her
 solitude misfortune, accepted offer devotion. he
 told birth, position, fortune, once, when
 consulted look paralytic, look answered, “that is
 good, proceed.”
 
“and now,” said morrel, finished first part his
 recital, “now told love hopes, may inform you
 intentions?”
 
“yes,” signified old man.
 
“this resolution; cabriolet waiting gate, in
 intended carry valentine sister’s house, marry
 her, wait respectfully m. villefort’s pardon.”
 
“no,” said noirtier.
 
“we must so?”
 
“no.”
 
“you sanction project?”
 
“no.”
 
“there another way,” said morrel. old man’s interrogative eye
 said, “which?”
 
“i will go,” continued maximilian, “i will seek m. franz d’Épinay—i am
 happy able mention mademoiselle villefort’s
 absence—and will conduct toward compel to
 challenge me.” noirtier’s look continued interrogate.
 
“you wish know will do?”
 
“yes.”
 
“i will find him, told you. will tell ties bind me

 renouncing accord hand betrothed, will secure
 friendship, love death; refuse, either through
 interest ridiculous pride, proved would
 forcing wife me, valentine loves me, will no

 kill him, will kill me; victorious, will marry
 valentine, die, sure valentine will marry him.”
 
noirtier watched, indescribable pleasure, noble sincere
 countenance, every sentiment tongue uttered depicted,
 adding expression fine features coloring adds to
 sound faithful drawing.
 
still, morrel finished, shut eyes several times, which
 manner saying “no.”
 
“no?” said morrel; “you disapprove second project, did
 first?”
 
“i do,” signified old man.
 
“but must done?” asked morrel. “madame saint-méran’s
 last request was, marriage might delayed; must let
 things take course?” noirtier move. “i understand,” said
 morrel; “i wait.”
 
“yes.”
 
“but delay may ruin plan, sir,” replied young man. “alone,
 valentine power; will compelled submit. here
 almost miraculously, can scarcely hope good opportunity
 occur again. believe me, two plans have
 proposed you; forgive vanity, tell prefer. do
 authorize mademoiselle valentine intrust honor?”
 
“no.”
 
“do prefer seek m. d’Épinay?”
 
“no.”
 
“whence will come help need—from chance?” resumed morrel.
 
“no.”
 
“from you?”
 
“yes.”
 
“you thoroughly understand me, sir? pardon eagerness, life
 depends answer. will help come you?”
 
“yes.”
 
“you sure it?”
 
“yes.” much firmness look gave answer,
 one could, rate, doubt will, power.
 
“oh, thank thousand times! how, unless miracle should
 restore speech, gesture, movement, can you, chained

 lit old man’s face, strange smile eyes paralyzed
 face.
 
“then must wait?” asked young man.
 
“yes.”
 
“but contract?” smile returned. “will assure it
 shall signed?”
 
“yes,” said noirtier.
 
“the contract shall signed!” cried morrel. “oh, pardon me, sir;
 can scarcely realize great happiness. will sign it?”
 
“no,” said paralytic. notwithstanding assurance, morrel still
 hesitated. promise impotent old man strange that,
 instead result power will, might emanate
 enfeebled organs. natural madman, ignorant of
 folly, attempt things beyond power? weak man talks
 burdens can raise, timid giants can confront, poor
 treasures spends, humble peasant, height his
 pride, calls jupiter. whether noirtier understood young
 man’s indecision, whether full confidence his
 docility, looked uneasily him.
 
“what wish, sir?” asked morrel; “that renew promise
 remaining tranquil?” noirtier’s eye remained fixed firm, if
 imply promise suffice; passed face
 hands.
 
“shall swear you, sir?” asked maximilian.
 
“yes,” said paralytic solemnity. morrel understood
 old man attached great importance oath. extended his
 hand.
 
“i swear you, honor,” said he, “to await decision
 respecting course pursue m. d’Épinay.”
 
“that right,” said old man.
 
“now,” said morrel, “do wish retire?”
 
“yes.”
 
“without seeing mademoiselle valentine?”
 
“yes.”
 
morrel made sign ready obey. “but,” said he, “first
 allow embrace daughter just now.” noirtier’s
 expression understood. young man pressed lips on

“besides, sir,” said villefort, addressing future

 hastening joyfully towards door, m. villefort altered his
 intention.
 
“stop,” said he; “i will go you.”

monte cristo cast one rapid curious glance round sanctum; it

“i see participate prevalent error,” said madame
 danglars.
 
“what it?” said monte cristo.
 
“that m. danglars speculates, whereas never does.”
 
“truly, madame, recollect m. debray told me——apropos, become

“nor i,” said madame danglars; “but began sentence, sir, did

“stay,” said monte cristo, though observed confusion,
 “i heard lucky hit made yesterday neapolitan

“i none—nor ever possessed any; really talked

 heard fate persecuting poor villeforts?”
 
“what happened?” said count, simulating total ignorance.
 
“you know marquis saint-méran died days set

“yes,” said monte cristo, “i heard that; but, claudius said to

“as usual. like philosopher.”
 
danglars returned moment alone.
 
“well,” said baroness, “do leave m. cavalcanti your
 daughter?”
 
“and mademoiselle d’armilly,” said banker; “do consider no

 charming young man, not? really prince?”
 
“i will answer it,” said monte cristo. “his father was
 introduced marquis, count; not
 think much claim title.”
 
“why?” said banker. “if prince, wrong maintain
 rank; like anyone deny origin.”
 
“oh, thorough democrat,” said monte cristo, smiling.
 
“but see exposing yourself?” said baroness.
 “if, perchance, m. morcerf came, find m. cavalcanti that
 room, he, betrothed eugénie, never admitted.”
 
“you may well say, perchance,” replied banker; “for comes so
 seldom, seem chance brings him.”
 
“but come find young man daughter, he

“he? mistaken. m. albert us honor be
 jealous; like eugénie sufficiently. besides, care for

“still, situated are——”
 
“yes, know situated? mother’s ball danced

“she quite well,” replied danglars quickly; “she piano

albert retained calm indifferent manner; might feel perhaps
 annoyed, knew monte cristo’s eye him. “m. cavalcanti has

“they suit remarkably well,” said danglars. albert appeared

 danglars blushed.
 
“i, too,” said young man, “am musician—at least, masters used

danglars smiled, seemed say, “it consequence.” then,
 hoping doubtless effect purpose, said,—“the prince my
 daughter universally admired yesterday. party,

“what prince?” asked albert.
 
“prince cavalcanti,” said danglars, persisted giving young

“pardon me,” said albert, “i aware prince. and

followed rather awkward silence.
 
“may also allowed,” said morcerf, “to pay respects to

“wait moment,” said banker, stopping young man; “do hear

danglars quite annoyed young man’s indifference. took
 monte cristo aside.
 
“what think lover?” said he.
 
“he appears cool. but, word given.”
 
“yes, doubtless promised give daughter man loves

“he musician.”
 
“so italians.”
 
“come, count, young man justice.”
 
“well, acknowledge annoys me, knowing connection the
 morcerf family, see throw way.” danglars burst
 laughing.
 
“what puritan are!” said he; “that happens every day.”
 
“but break way; morcerfs depending on

“indeed.”
 
“positively.”
 
“then let explain themselves; give father hint,

“i?—where devil find that?”
 
“at ball; apparent enough. why, countess, the
 proud mercédès, disdainful catalane, will scarcely open her
 lips oldest acquaintances, take arm, lead the
 garden, private walks, remain half hour?”
 
“ah, baron, baron,” said albert, “you listening—what barbarism

“oh, don’t worry me, sir mocker,” said danglars; turning to
 monte cristo said:
 
“but will undertake speak father?”
 
“willingly, wish it.”
 
“but let done explicitly positively. demands my

“yes, sir, will give attention subject.”
 
“i say await pleasure decision, await

 sighed m. cavalcanti done half hour before.
 
“bravi! bravo! brava!” cried morcerf, parodying banker, the
 selection came end. danglars began look suspiciously at
 morcerf, someone came whispered words him.
 
“i shall soon return,” said banker monte cristo; “wait me. i

 cavalcanti evidently embarrassed; bowed morcerf, replied
 impertinent look possible. albert launched in
 praise mademoiselle danglars’ voice, regret, what
 just heard, unable present previous

cavalcanti, left alone, turned monte cristo.
 
“come,” said madame danglars, “leave music compliments, let us
 go take tea.”
 
“come, louise,” said mademoiselle danglars friend.

 banker explanation.
 
“i just received courier greece,” said danglars.
 
“ah, yes,” said count; “that reason running away

“yes.”
 
“how king otho getting on?” asked albert sprightly tone.
 
danglars cast another suspicious look towards without answering,
 monte cristo turned away conceal expression pity which

“we shall go together, shall not?” said albert count.
 
“if like,” replied latter.
 
albert understand banker’s look, turning monte

 looked me?”
 
“yes,” said count; “but think anything particular

“indeed, did; mean news greece?”
 
“how can tell you?”
 
“because imagine correspondents country.”
 
monte cristo smiled significantly.
 
“stop,” said albert, “here comes. shall compliment mademoiselle

“if compliment all, let voice, least,” said
 monte cristo.
 
“no, everyone that.”
 
“my dear viscount, dreadfully impertinent.”
 
albert advanced towards eugénie, smiling.
 
meanwhile, danglars, stooping monte cristo’s ear, “your advice was
 excellent,” said he; “there whole history connected names

“indeed?” said monte cristo.
 
“yes, will tell all; take away young man; endure

“he going me. shall send father you?”
 
“immediately.”
 
“very well.” count made sign albert bowed the

 laughter—much loud fact give idea rather
 forced unnatural.
 
“well,” said he, “i will ask question charles ix.

 ‘how played little part?’”
 
“to allude?” asked monte cristo.
 
“to installation rival m. danglars’.”
 
“what rival?”
 
“_ma foi!_ rival? why, protégé, m. andrea cavalcanti!”
 
“ah, joking, viscount, please; patronize m.
 andrea—at least, concerns m. danglars.”
 
“and blame assisting him, young man
 really needed help quarter, but, happily me, can

“what, think paying addresses?”
 
“i certain it; languishing looks modulated tones when
 addressing mademoiselle danglars fully proclaim intentions. he
 aspires hand proud eugénie.”
 
“what signify, long favor suit?”
 
“but case, dear count: contrary. repulsed
 sides.”
 
“what!”
 
“it indeed; mademoiselle eugénie scarcely answers me, and
 mademoiselle d’armilly, confidant, speak all.”
 
“but father greatest regard possible you,” said monte
 cristo.
 
“he? oh, no, plunged thousand daggers heart,

“jealousy indicates affection.”
 
“true; jealous.”
 
“he is.”
 
“of whom?—of debray?”
 
“no, you.”
 
“of me? will engage say week past door will

“by charged?”
 
“by baron himself.”

“certainly shall, albert, promised it.”
 
“well,” said albert, sigh, “it seems determined marry

“i determined try good terms everybody, all

“there misunderstanding.”
 
“what, baroness?”
 
“no, baron.”
 
“has perceived anything?”
 
“ah, good joke!”
 
“do think suspects?” said monte cristo charming
 artlessness.
 
“where come from, dear count?” said albert.
 
“from congo, will.”
 
“it must farther even that.”
 
“but know parisian husbands?”
 
“oh, dear count, husbands pretty much everywhere; an
 individual husband country pretty fair specimen the

“but then, can led quarrel danglars and

“ah, now trying penetrate mysteries isis, in

“certainly, will.”
 
“my carriage shall take back.”
 
“no, thank you; gave orders _coupé_ follow me.”
 
“there is, then,” said monte cristo, stepped the
 carriage. went house; drawing-room lighted
 up—they went there. “you will make tea us, baptistin,” said the
 count. baptistin left room without waiting answer, two
 seconds reappeared, bringing tray, master had
 ordered, ready prepared, appearing sprung ground,
 like repasts read fairy tales.
 
“really, dear count,” said morcerf, “what admire is, so
 much riches, perhaps people even wealthier than

 possessed much,—but manner served, without any
 questions, moment, second; guessed you
 wanted manner ringing, made point keeping

“what say perhaps true; know habits. instance, you

“_ma foi_, like smoke.”
 
monte cristo took gong struck once. space a
 second private door opened, ali appeared, bringing two chibouques
 filled excellent latakia.
 
“it quite wonderful,” said albert.
 
“oh no, simple possible,” replied monte cristo. “ali knows
 generally smoke taking tea coffee; heard that
 ordered tea, also knows brought home me; when
 summoned naturally guessed reason so, as
 comes country hospitality especially manifested
 medium smoking, naturally concludes shall
 smoke company, therefore brings two chibouques instead of

“certainly give commonplace air explanation, it
 less true you——ah, hear?” morcerf
 inclined head towards door, sounds seemed to
 issue resembling guitar.
 
“_ma foi_, dear viscount, fated hear music evening;

“haydée—what adorable name! there, then, really women bear

“certainly are. haydée uncommon name france, is
 common enough albania epirus; said, example,

 parisians call it.”
 
“oh, charming,” said albert, “how like hear my
 countrywomen called mademoiselle goodness, mademoiselle silence,

“hush,” said count, “do joke loud tone; haydée may hear
 you, perhaps.”
 
“and think angry?”
 
“no, certainly not,” said count haughty expression.
 
“she amiable, then, not?” said albert.
 
“it called amiability, duty; slave not

“come; joking now. slaves had

“undoubtedly.”
 
“really, count, nothing, nothing like people. the

“a hundred thousand francs! poor girl originally possessed much

“she must princess then.”
 
“you right; one greatest country too.”
 
“i thought so. happen great princess became

“how dionysius tyrant became schoolmaster? the

“monsieur, will necessary reflect give an
 answer.”
 
“to reflect?” said morcerf, astonished; “have had
 enough time reflection eight years elapsed
 since marriage first discussed us?”
 
“count,” said banker, “things constantly occurring world

“these many empty words, dear sir,” said morcerf: “they
 might satisfy new acquaintance, comte morcerf not

 plighted word, man fails redeem pledge, has
 least right exact good reason doing.”
 
danglars coward, wish appear so; piqued at

“you must aware, events, impossible to

“and towards bear personal ill-feeling, then?” said
 morcerf, turning pale anger. expression count’s face
 remained unperceived banker; fixed look of

tremor suppressed rage shook whole frame count, and
 making violent effort himself, said: “i right to
 insist giving explanation. madame morcerf who
 displeased you? fortune find insufficient? it
 opinions differ yours?”
 
“nothing kind, sir,” replied danglars: “if the

“then, sir, patiently submit refusal?”
 
“yes, sir, although assure refusal painful to

“ah,” said caderousse, “i promised——”
 
“and breaking promise!” interrupted monte cristo.
 
“alas, yes!” said caderousse uneasily.
 
“a bad relapse, will lead you, mistake not, place de
 grève. much worse, much worse—_diavolo!_ say in
 country.”
 
“reverend sir, impelled——”
 
“every criminal says thing.”
 
“poverty——”
 
“pshaw!” said busoni disdainfully; “poverty may make man beg, steal a
 loaf bread baker’s door, cause open secretaire
 house supposed inhabited. jeweller johannes had
 just paid 45,000 francs diamond given you, you
 killed get diamond money both, also
 poverty?”
 
“pardon, reverend sir,” said caderousse; “you saved life once,
 save again!”
 
“that poor encouragement.”
 
“are alone, reverend sir, soldiers ready seize
 me?”
 
“i alone,” said abbé, “and will pity you, and
 will let escape, risk fresh miseries weakness may
 lead to, tell truth.”
 
“ah, reverend sir,” cried caderousse, clasping hands, drawing
 nearer monte cristo, “i may indeed say deliverer!”
 
“you mean say freed confinement?”
 
“yes, true, reverend sir.”
 
“who liberator?”
 
“an englishman.”
 
“what name?”
 
“lord wilmore.”
 
“i know him; shall know lie.”
 
“ah, reverend sir, tell simple truth.”
 
“was englishman protecting you?”
 
“no, me, young corsican, companion.”
 
“what young corsican’s name?”
 
“benedetto.”
 
“is christian name?”
 
“he other; foundling.”
 
“then young man escaped you?”
 
“he did.”
 
“in way?”
 
“we working saint-mandrier, near toulon. know
 saint-mandrier?”
 
“i do.”
 
“in hour rest, noon one o’clock——”
 
“galley-slaves nap dinner! may well pity poor
 fellows!” said abbé.
 
“nay,” said caderousse, “one can’t always work—one dog.”
 
“so much better dogs,” said monte cristo.
 
“while rest slept, then, went away short distance; severed
 fetters file englishman given us, swam away.”
 
“and become benedetto?”
 
“i don’t know.”
 
“you know.”
 
“no, truth; parted hyères.” and, give weight his
 protestation, caderousse advanced another step towards abbé, who
 remained motionless place, calm ever, pursuing his
 interrogation.
 
“you lie,” said abbé busoni, tone irresistible authority.

 money given you.”
 
“true,” said caderousse; “benedetto become great
 lord.”
 
“how can great lord?”
 
“a natural son.”
 
“and great lord’s name?”
 
“the count monte cristo, whose house are.”
 
“benedetto count’s son?” replied monte cristo, astonished his
 turn.
 
“well, think so, since count found false
 father—since count gives four thousand francs month, and
 leaves 500,000 francs will.”
 
“ah, yes,” said factitious abbé, began understand; “and what
 name young man bear meanwhile?”
 
“andrea cavalcanti.”
 
“is it, then, young man friend count monte cristo

“exactly.”
 
“and suffer that, wretch!—you, know life his

“why stand comrade’s way?” said caderousse.
 
“you right; apprise m. danglars, i.”
 
“do so, reverend sir.”
 
“why not?”
 
“because bring us ruin.”
 
“and think save villains will become an

“reverend sir,” said caderousse, drawing still nearer.
 
“i will expose all.”
 
“to whom?”
 
“to m. danglars.”
 
“by heaven!” cried caderousse, drawing waistcoat open

“ah, good excellent friend,” said albert; “yes, you

“beauchamp worthy fellow,” said monte cristo, journalist

“yes, sincere friend; love devotedly. now are

“into normandy, like.”
 
“delightful; shall quite retired? society, neighbors?”

“what mean say is, mother quick give her

“ah, yes, indeed,” said monte cristo sigh; “and think she

“i repeat it, must really strange superior man, for
 mother absorbed interest excited, i

“and try make dislike me?”
 
“on contrary, often says, ‘morcerf, believe count a

“indeed?” said monte cristo, sighing.
 
“you see, then,” said albert, “that instead opposing, will
 encourage me.”
 
“adieu, then, five o’clock; punctual, shall arrive at

“at tréport?”
 
“yes; neighborhood.”
 
“but can travel forty-eight leagues eight hours?”
 
“easily,” said monte cristo.
 
“you certainly prodigy; will soon surpass the

“but, viscount, since perform journey less seven
 eight hours, keep waiting.”
 
“do fear, little prepare.”

departure, count went haydée’s apartments, told her
 intention, resigned everything care.
 
albert punctual. journey soon became interesting its
 rapidity, morcerf formed previous idea.
 
“truly,” said monte cristo, “with post-horses going rate of
 two leagues hour, absurd law one traveller shall not
 pass another without permission, invalid ill-tempered
 traveller may detain well active, impossible to
 move; escape annoyance travelling postilion and
 horses; not, ali?”
 
count put head window whistled, horses
 appeared fly. carriage rolled thundering noise the
 pavement, everyone turned notice dazzling meteor. ali,
 smiling, repeated sound, grasped reins firm hand, and
 spurred horses, whose beautiful manes floated breeze. this
 child desert element, black face and
 sparkling eyes appeared, cloud dust raised, like the
 genius simoom god hurricane.
 
“i never knew till now delight speed,” said morcerf, the
 last cloud disappeared brow; “but devil get
 horses? made order?”
 
“precisely,” said count; “six years since bought horse in
 hungary remarkable swiftness. thirty-two shall use
 tonight progeny; entirely black, the
 exception star upon forehead.”
 
“that perfectly admirable; do, count, these
 horses?”
 
“you see, travel them.”
 
“but always travelling.”
 
“when longer require them, bertuccio will sell them, he
 expects realize thirty forty thousand francs sale.”
 
“but monarch europe will wealthy enough purchase them.”
 
“then will sell eastern vizier, will empty his

“count, may suggest one idea you?”
 
“certainly.”
 
“it that, next you, bertuccio must richest gentleman in

“you mistaken, viscount; believe franc his

“then must wonder. dear count, tell many more

“i countenance nothing marvellous, m. albert. tell me, does

“because, suppose, nature so, love of

“you mistaken; wife family, and
 ambitious desires them. also sure of

 now, m. bertuccio alone world; uses property without
 accounting use makes it; sure never leave my

“why?”
 
“because never get better.”
 
“probabilities deceptive.”
 
“but deal certainties; best servant one has
 power life death.”
 
“do possess right bertuccio?”
 
“yes.”
 
words close conversation iron door; was
 count’s “yes.”
 
whole journey performed equal rapidity; thirty-two
 horses, dispersed seven stages, brought destination

 morning morcerf conducted apartments, bath and
 supper prepared. servant travelled back the

albert bathed, took supper, went bed. night was
 lulled melancholy noise surf. rising, went his

around schooner lay number small fishing-boats belonging to

 stopped, two days, luxury abounded life went the
 utmost ease.
 
albert found anteroom two guns, accoutrements for
 hunting; lofty room ground floor containing ingenious
 instruments english—eminent piscatory pursuits, since are
 patient sluggish—have invented fishing. day passed in
 pursuing exercises monte cristo excelled. killed a
 dozen pheasants park, many trout stream, dined a
 summer-house overlooking ocean, took tea library.
 
towards evening third day. albert, completely exhausted with
 exercise invigorated monte cristo, sleeping an
 armchair near window, count designing his
 architect plan conservatory house, sound a
 horse full speed high road made albert look up. was
 disagreeably surprised see valet chambre, not
 brought, might inconvenience monte cristo.

“florentin here!” cried he, starting up; “is mother ill?” he
 hastened door. monte cristo watched saw approach the
 valet, drew small sealed parcel pocket, containing a
 newspaper letter.
 
“from this?” said eagerly.
 
“from m. beauchamp,” replied florentin.
 
“did send you?”
 
“yes, sir; sent house, gave money journey,
 procured horse, made promise stop till reached
 you, come fifteen hours.”
 
albert opened letter fear, uttered shriek reading the
 first line, seized paper. sight dimmed, legs sank
 him, fallen florentin supported him.
 
“poor young man,” said monte cristo low voice; “it true
 father shall fall children third and
 fourth generation.”
 
meanwhile albert revived, and, continuing read, threw back
 head, saying:
 
“florentin, horse fit return immediately?”
 
“it poor, lame post-horse.”
 
“in state house left?”
 
“all quiet, returning m. beauchamp’s, found madame in
 tears; sent know return. told my
 orders m. beauchamp; first extended arms prevent me,
 moment’s reflection, ‘yes, go, florentin,’ said she, ‘and
 may come quickly.’”
 
“yes, mother,” said albert, “i will return, woe infamous
 wretch! first must get there.”
 
went back room left monte cristo. five minutes
 sufficed make complete transformation appearance. his
 voice become rough hoarse; face furrowed wrinkles;
 eyes burned blue-veined lids, tottered like a
 drunken man.
 
“count,” said he, “i thank hospitality, would
 gladly enjoyed longer; must return paris.”
 
“what happened?”
 
“a great misfortune, important life. don’t question me,
 beg you, lend horse.”
 
“my stables command, viscount; will kill yourself
 riding horseback. take post-chaise carriage.”
 
“no, delay me, need fatigue warn of; will
 good.”
 
albert reeled shot, fell chair near the
 door. monte cristo see second manifestation physical
 exhaustion; window, calling:
 
“ali, horse m. morcerf—quick! hurry!”
 
40190m
 


words restored albert; darted room, followed the
 count.
 
“thank you!” cried he, throwing horse.
 
“return soon can, florentin. must use password to
 procure horse?”
 
“only dismount; another will immediately saddled.”
 
albert hesitated moment. “you may think departure strange and
 foolish,” said young man; “you know paragraph a
 newspaper may exasperate one. read that,” said he, “when gone,
 may witness anger.”
 
count picked paper put spurs horse, which
 leaped astonishment unusual stimulus, shot away with
 rapidity arrow. count watched feeling of
 compassion, completely disappeared, read follows:
 
“the french officer service ali pasha yanina alluded to
 three weeks since _l’impartial_, surrendered castle
 yanina, sold benefactor turks, styled truly
 time fernand, esteemed contemporary states; has
 since added christian name title nobility family
 name. now calls count morcerf, ranks among the
 peers.”
 
thus terrible secret, beauchamp generously destroyed,
 appeared like armed phantom; another paper, deriving its
 information malicious source, published two days after
 albert’s departure normandy lines rendered the
 unfortunate young man almost crazy.
 


chapter 86. trial
 
eight o’clock morning albert arrived beauchamp’s door.
 valet chambre received orders usher once.
 beauchamp bath.
 
“here am,” albert said.
 
“well, poor friend,” replied beauchamp, “i expected you.”
 
“i need say think faithful kind have
 spoken painful circumstance. sent another
 proof affection. so, without losing time, tell me, the
 slightest idea whence terrible blow proceeds?”
 
“i think clew.”
 
“but first tell particulars shameful plot.”
 
beauchamp proceeded relate young man, overwhelmed
 shame grief, following facts. two days previously, the
 article appeared another paper besides _ l’impartial_, and, what
 serious, one well known government paper.
 beauchamp breakfasting read paragraph. sent
 immediately cabriolet, hastened publisher’s office.
 although professing diametrically opposite principles the
 editor paper, beauchamp—as sometimes, may say often,
 happens—was intimate friend. editor reading, apparent
 delight, leading article paper beet-sugar, probably a
 composition own.
 
“ah, _pardieu!_” said beauchamp, “with paper hand, my
 friend, need tell cause visit.”
 
“are interested sugar question?” asked editor the
 ministerial paper.
 
“no,” replied beauchamp, “i considered question; totally
 different subject interests me.”
 
“what it?”
 
“the article relative morcerf.”
 
“indeed? curious affair?”
 
“so curious, think running great risk prosecution
 defamation character.”
 
“not all; received information requisite
 proofs, quite sure m. morcerf will raise voice
 us; besides, rendering service one’s country to
 denounce wretched criminals unworthy honor
 bestowed them.”
 
beauchamp thunderstruck.
 
“who, then, correctly informed you?” asked he; “for paper,
 gave first information subject, obliged to
 stop want proof; yet interested in
 exposing m. morcerf, peer france, the
 opposition.”
 
“oh, simple; sought scandalize. news
 brought us. man arrived yesterday yanina, bringing a
 formidable array documents; hesitated publish the
 accusatory article, told us inserted other
 paper.”
 
beauchamp understood nothing remained submit, left the
 office despatch courier morcerf. unable send
 albert following particulars, events transpired after
 messenger’s departure; namely, day great agitation
 manifest house peers among usually calm members of
 dignified assembly. everyone arrived almost usual

 attention public towards one illustrious
 colleagues. perusing article, others making comments and
 recalling circumstances substantiated charges still more.
 
count morcerf favorite colleagues. like all
 upstarts, recourse great deal haughtiness to

 repelled him, honorable instinctively despised him. was, in
 fact, unhappy position victim marked sacrifice; the
 finger god pointed him, everyone prepared raise the

 much complacency.
 
count notice introduction, speaker

 demanded undivided attention house; mention of

president put vote, decided the

 found alive horrible blow.
 
“my lords,” answered he, “it time repel attack

 prove noble colleagues equal worth.”
 
words made favorable impression behalf accused.
 
“i demand, then, examination shall take place soon as

“what day fix?” asked president.
 
“today service,” replied count.
 
president rang bell. “does house approve the
 examination take place today?”

“yes,” unanimous answer.
 
committee twelve members chosen examine proofs brought
 forward morcerf. investigation begin eight o’clock that
 evening committee-room, postponement necessary, the
 proceedings resumed evening hour. morcerf
 asked leave retire; collect documents long been
 preparing storm, sagacity foreseen.
 
beauchamp related young man facts just narrated;
 story, however, advantage animation of
 living things coldness dead things.
 
albert listened, trembling now hope, anger, then
 shame, beauchamp’s confidence knew father
 guilty, asked how, since guilty, could
 prove innocence. beauchamp hesitated continue narrative.
 
“what next?” asked albert.
 
“what next? friend, impose painful task me. must know
 all?”
 
“absolutely; rather lips another’s.”
 
“muster courage, then, never required it
 more.”
 
albert passed hand forehead, try strength, as
 man preparing defend life proves shield bends

 energy. “go on,” said he.
 
“the evening arrived; paris expectation. many said your

 committee made liberals, several came forward to
 shake hands him.”
 
albert felt heart bursting particulars, gratitude
 mingled sorrow: gladly embraced had
 given father proof esteem moment honor so
 powerfully attacked.
 
“at moment one door-keepers brought letter the
 president. ‘you liberty speak, m. morcerf,’ said the
 president, unsealed letter; count began defence,

albert started hearing words; history haydée recurred
 him, remembered said message the
 ring, manner sold made slave.
 
“and effect discourse produce?” anxiously inquired
 albert.
 
“i acknowledge affected me, and, indeed, committee also,”
 said beauchamp.
 
“meanwhile, president carelessly opened letter been

“‘yes, sir.’—‘who it?’—‘a woman, accompanied servant.’ everyone

“i mean,” said albert, drawing near, without apparently noticing

“not crush accursed race?” murmured he; “abandon purpose the
 moment accomplishment? impossible, madame, impossible!”
 
“edmond,” said poor mother, tried every means, “when call you
 edmond, call mercédès?”
 
“mercédès!” repeated monte cristo; “mercédès! well yes, right;

count, fearing yield entreaties ardently
 loved, called sufferings assistance hatred.
 
“revenge yourself, then, edmond,” cried poor mother; “but let your
 vengeance fall culprits,—on him, me, son!”
 
“it written good book,” said monte cristo, “that sins of
 fathers shall fall upon children third fourth

“edmond,” continued mercédès, arms extended towards count,
 “since first knew you, adored name, respected your

“have known father starve death your

“no,” interrupted mercédès, “but seen loved the

mercédès uttered words deep anguish, accent of
 intense despair, monte cristo restrain sob. the
 lion daunted; avenger conquered.
 
“what ask me?” said he,—“your son’s life? well, shall
 live!”
 
mercédès uttered cry made tears start monte cristo’s
 eyes; tears disappeared almost instantaneously, for,
 doubtless, god sent angel collect them—far precious
 eyes richest pearls guzerat ophir.
 
“oh,” said she, seizing count’s hand raising lips;
 “oh, thank you, thank you, edmond! now exactly dreamt

“so much better,” replied monte cristo; “as poor edmond will

“what say, edmond?”
 
“i say, since command me, mercédès, must die.”
 
“die? so? talks dying? whence ideas of

“but duel will take place, edmond, since forgive?”
 
“it will take place,” said monte cristo, solemn tone; “but
 instead son’s blood stain ground, mine will flow.”
 
mercédès shrieked, sprang towards monte cristo, but, suddenly
 stopping, “edmond,” said she, “there god us, since live
 since seen again; trust heart. while
 waiting assistance trust word; said son

“yes, madame, shall live,” said monte cristo, surprised without
 emotion mercédès accepted heroic sacrifice made for

“edmond,” said she, eyes wet tears looking at

“edmond,” said mercédès, “i one word say you.”
 
count smiled bitterly.
 
“edmond,” continued she, “you will see face pale, my
 eyes dull, beauty gone; mercédès, short, longer

chapter 90. meeting
 
mercédès left monte cristo, fell profound gloom.
 around within flight thought seemed stopped;
 energetic mind slumbered, body extreme fatigue.
 
“what?” said himself, lamp wax lights were
 nearly burnt out, servants waiting impatiently the
 anteroom; “what? edifice long preparing,
 reared much care toil, crushed a

 fourteen years despair ten hope rendered believer in

“and this—all this, heart, thought dead, was

“yet,” continued count, becoming moment absorbed the

 become crimes exaggeration. no, must conceived some
 pathetic scene; will come throw us; what

blush pride mounted count’s forehead thought
 passed mind.
 
“ridiculous?” repeated he; “and ridicule will fall me. i
 ridiculous? no, rather die.”
 
thus exaggerating mind anticipated ill-fortune the
 next day, condemned promising mercédès to
 spare son, count last exclaimed:
 
“folly, folly, folly!—to carry generosity far put as

 death suicide; yet important honor my
 memory,—and surely vanity, justifiable pride,—it is

 powerful others struck myself. must be;

seizing pen, drew paper secret drawer desk, and
 wrote bottom document (which will,
 made since arrival paris) sort codicil, clearly explaining
 nature death.
 
“i this, oh, god,” said he, eyes raised heaven, “as
 much thy honor mine. ten years considered

 awaits another, exchanging time for
 eternity.”
 
thus agitated gloomy uncertainties,—wretched waking
 dreams grief,—the first rays morning pierced windows, and
 shone upon pale blue paper just inscribed his
 justification providence.
 
just five o’clock morning slight noise like a
 stifled sigh reached ear. turned head, looked around him,
 saw one; sound repeated distinctly enough to
 convince reality.
 
arose, quietly opening door drawing-room, saw haydée,
 fallen chair, arms hanging beautiful
 head thrown back. standing door, prevent his
 going without seeing her, sleep, young cannot
 resist, overpowered frame, wearied watching.
 noise door awaken her, monte cristo gazed her
 affectionate regret.
 
“she remembered son,” said he; “and forgot a
 daughter.” then, shaking head sorrowfully, “poor haydée,” said he;
 “she wished see me, speak me; feared guessed
 something. oh, go without taking leave her; die
 without confiding someone.”
 
quietly regained seat, wrote lines:
 
“i bequeath maximilian morrel, captain spahis,—and my
 former patron, pierre morrel, shipowner marseilles,—the sum of
 twenty millions, part may offered sister julie and
 brother-in-law emmanuel, fear increase fortune

finishing last line cry behind made start,
 pen fell hand.
 
“haydée,” said he, “did read it?”
 
“oh, lord,” said she, “why writing thus hour? why
 bequeathing fortune me? going leave me?”
 
“i going journey, dear child,” said monte cristo, an
 expression infinite tenderness melancholy; “and any
 misfortune happen me——”
 
count stopped.
 
“well?” asked young girl, authoritative tone count had
 never observed before, startled him.
 
“well, misfortune happen me,” replied monte cristo, “i wish
 daughter happy.” haydée smiled sorrowfully, shook her
 head.
 
“do think dying, lord?” said she.
 
“the wise man, child, said, ‘it good think death.’”
 
“well, die,” said she, “bequeath fortune others, if
 die shall require nothing;” and, taking paper, tore in
 four pieces, threw middle room. then, effort
 exhausted strength, fell, asleep time, but
 fainting floor.
 
count leaned raised arms; seeing that
 sweet pale face, lovely eyes closed, beautiful form
 motionless appearance lifeless, idea occurred for
 first time, perhaps loved otherwise daughter
 loves father.
 
“alas,” murmured he, intense suffering, “i might, then, been
 happy yet.”

 sound cabriolet entering yard heard. monte cristo
 approached window, saw maximilian emmanuel alight. “good,”
 said he; “it time,”—and sealed will three seals.

“i perhaps come soon, count,” said he, “but frankly
 acknowledge closed eyes night, anyone in

“morrel,” said he, “it happy day me, feel beloved
 man you. good-morning, emmanuel; will come me
 then, maximilian?”
 
“did doubt it?” said young captain.
 
“but wrong——”
 
“i watched whole scene challenge yesterday; i
 thinking firmness night, said myself
 justice must side, man’s countenance longer to

“but, morrel, albert friend?”
 
“simply acquaintance, sir.”
 
“you met day first saw me?”
 
“yes, true; recollected not

“thank you, morrel.” ringing bell once, “look.” said to
 ali, came immediately, “take solicitor. will,

“what?” said morrel, “you dead?”
 
“yes; must prepared everything, dear friend? did

“i went tortoni’s, where, expected, found beauchamp and
 château-renaud. seeking them.”
 
“why, arranged?”
 
“listen, count; affair serious unavoidable.”
 
“did doubt it!”
 
“no; offence public, everyone already talking it.”
 
“well?”
 
“well, hoped get exchange arms,—to substitute sword for
 pistol; pistol blind.”
 
“have succeeded?” asked monte cristo quickly, imperceptible
 gleam hope.
 
“no; skill sword well known.”
 
“ah?—who betrayed me?”
 
“the skilful swordsman conquered.”
 
“and failed?”
 
“they positively refused.”
 
“morrel,” said count, “have ever seen fire pistol?”
 
“never.”
 
“well, time; look.” monte cristo took pistols held in
 hand mercédès entered, fixing ace clubs the
 iron plate, four shots successively shot four sides of
 club. shot morrel turned pale. examined bullets with

 larger buckshot.
 
“it astonishing,” said he. “look, emmanuel.” turning towards
 monte cristo, “count,” said he, “in name dear to
 you, entreat kill albert!—the unhappy youth mother.”
 
“you right,” said monte cristo; “and none.” words were
 uttered tone made morrel shudder.
 
“you offended party, count.”
 
“doubtless; imply?”
 
“that will fire first.”
 
“i fire first?”
 
“oh, obtained, rather claimed that; conceded enough for

“and distance?”
 
“twenty paces.” smile terrible import passed count’s
 lips.
 
“morrel,” said he, “do forget just seen.”
 
“the chance albert’s safety, then, will arise your
 emotion.”
 
“i suffer emotion?” said monte cristo.
 
“or generosity, friend; good marksman are,
 may say appear absurd another.”
 
“what that?”
 
“break arm—wound him—but kill him.”
 
“i will tell you, morrel,” said count, “that need
 entreating spare life m. morcerf; shall well
 spared, will return quietly two friends, i——”
 
“and you?”
 
“that will another thing; shall brought home.”
 
“no, no,” cried maximilian, quite unable restrain feelings.
 
“as told you, dear morrel, m. morcerf will kill me.”
 
morrel looked utter amazement. “but happened, then,
 since last evening, count?”
 
“the thing happened brutus night battle of
 philippi; seen ghost.”
 
“and ghost——”
 
“told me, morrel, lived long enough.”

“we first,” said morrel, looking window.
 
“excuse me, sir,” said baptistin, followed master with
 indescribable terror, “but think see carriage under

monte cristo sprang lightly carriage, offered hand to
 assist emmanuel maximilian. latter retained count’s hand
 his.
 
“i like,” said he, “to feel hand like this, owner relies on
 goodness cause.”
 
“it seems me,” said emmanuel, “that see two young men there,
 evidently, waiting.”
 
monte cristo drew morrel step two behind brother-in-law.
 
“maximilian,” said he, “are affections disengaged?” morrel looked
 monte cristo astonishment. “i seek confidence, my
 dear friend. ask simple question; answer it;—that i
 require.”
 
“i love young girl, count.”
 
“do love much?”
 
“more life.”
 
“another hope defeated!” said count. then, sigh, “poor
 haydée!” murmured he.
 
“to tell truth, count, knew less you, think that
 less brave are.”
 
“because sigh thinking someone leaving? come, morrel, it
 like soldier bad judge courage. regret

“that purpose. brought arms?”
 
“i?—what for? hope gentlemen theirs.”
 
“i will inquire,” said morrel.
 
“do; make treaty—you understand me?”
 
“you need fear.” morrel advanced towards beauchamp and
 château-renaud, who, seeing intention, came meet him. three
 young men bowed courteously, affably.
 
“excuse me, gentlemen,” said morrel, “but see m. morcerf.”
 
“he sent us word morning,” replied château-renaud, “that would
 meet us ground.”
 
“ah,” said morrel. beauchamp pulled watch.

“oh, made allusion kind,” replied morrel.
 
“there carriage coming,” said château-renaud. advanced rapidly

“oh, m. beauchamp, assure m. morcerf know

“gentlemen,” said château-renaud, “it morcerf coming that
 carriage;—faith, franz debray!”
 
two young men announced indeed approaching. “what chance
 brings here, gentlemen?” said château-renaud, shaking hands with
 them.
 
“because,” said debray, “albert sent morning request us to
 come.” beauchamp château-renaud exchanged looks astonishment. “i
 think understand reason,” said morrel.
 
“what it?”
 
“yesterday afternoon received letter m. morcerf, begging me
 attend opera.”
 
“and i,” said debray.
 
“and also,” said franz.
 
“and we, too,” added beauchamp château-renaud.
 
“having wished witness challenge, now wishes to
 present combat.”
 
“exactly so,” said young men; “you probably guessed right.”
 
“but, arrangements, come himself,” said
 château-renaud. “albert ten minutes time.”
 
“there comes,” said beauchamp, “on horseback, full gallop,
 followed servant.”
 
“how imprudent,” said château-renaud, “to come horseback fight a
 duel pistols, instructions given him.”
 
“and besides,” said beauchamp, “with collar cravat, open
 coat white waistcoat! painted spot upon his
 heart?—it simple.”
 
meanwhile albert arrived within ten paces group formed by
 five young men. jumped horse, threw bridle his
 servant’s arms, joined them. pale, eyes red and
 swollen; evident slept. shade melancholy
 gravity overspread countenance, natural him.
 
“i thank you, gentlemen,” said he, “for complied my

“sir,” said maximilian, “you perhaps aware m. de

“i sure, thought might so. much better; the
 honorable men better shall satisfied.”
 
“m. morrel,” said château-renaud, “will apprise count monte

morrel preparing fulfil commission. beauchamp meanwhile
 drawn box pistols carriage.
 
“stop, gentlemen,” said albert; “i two words say count
 monte cristo.”
 
“in private?” asked morrel.
 
“no, sir; here.”
 
albert’s witnesses looked other. franz debray exchanged
 words whisper, morrel, rejoiced unexpected
 incident, went fetch count, walking retired path
 emmanuel.
 
“what want me?” said monte cristo.
 
“i know, wishes speak you.”
 
“ah?” said monte cristo, “i trust going tempt some
 fresh insult!”
 
“i think intention,” said morrel.
 
count advanced, accompanied maximilian emmanuel. calm
 serene look formed singular contrast albert’s grief-stricken
 face, approached also, followed four young men.
 
three paces distant other, albert count
 stopped.
 
“approach, gentlemen,” said albert; “i wish lose one word of
 honor saying count monte
 cristo, must repeated will listen it,
 strange may appear you.”
 
“proceed, sir,” said count.
 
“sir,” said albert, first tremulous voice, which
 gradually became firmer, “i reproached exposing conduct of
 m. morcerf epirus, guilty knew was, thought had
 right punish him; since learned that
 right. fernand mondego’s treachery towards ali pasha which
 induces readily excuse you, treachery fisherman
 fernand towards you, almost unheard-of miseries its
 consequences; say, proclaim publicly, were
 justified revenging father, i, son, thank you
 using greater severity.”
 
thunderbolt fallen midst spectators this
 unexpected scene, surprised did
 albert’s declaration. monte cristo, eyes slowly rose towards
 heaven expression infinite gratitude. not
 understand albert’s fiery nature, seen much
 among roman bandits, suddenly stooped humiliation. he
 recognized influence mercédès, saw noble heart had
 opposed sacrifice knew beforehand useless.
 
“now, sir,” said albert, “if think apology sufficient, pray give
 hand. next merit infallibility appear to
 possess, rank candidly acknowledging fault. this
 confession concerns only. acted well man, acted
 better man. angel alone saved one us from
 death—that angel came heaven, make us friends (which,
 alas, fatality renders impossible), least make us esteem each
 other.”
 
monte cristo, moistened eye, heaving breast, lips half open,
 extended albert hand latter pressed sentiment
 resembling respectful fear.
 
“gentlemen,” said he, “m. monte cristo receives apology. had
 acted hastily towards him. hasty actions generally bad ones. now my
 fault repaired. hope world will call cowardly for
 acting conscience dictated. anyone entertain a
 false opinion me,” added he, drawing would
 challenge friends enemies, “i shall endeavor correct his
 mistake.”
 
“what happened night?” asked beauchamp château-renaud;
 “we appear make sorry figure here.”
 
“in truth, albert just done either despicable very
 noble,” replied baron.
 
“what can mean?” said debray franz.
 
“the count monte cristo acts dishonorably m. morcerf, is
 justified son! ten yaninas family, only
 consider bound fight ten times.”
 
monte cristo, head bent down, arms powerless.
 bowing weight twenty-four years’ reminiscences, thought
 albert, beauchamp, château-renaud, that

“providence still,” murmured he; “now fully convinced of

“oh, yes,” said château-renaud.
 
“it magnificent,” continued beauchamp, “to able exercise so
 much self-control!”
 
“assuredly; me, incapable it,” said
 château-renaud, significant coolness.
 
“gentlemen,” interrupted albert, “i think understand that
 something serious passed m. monte cristo and

“possibly, possibly,” said beauchamp immediately; “but every simpleton
 able understand heroism, sooner later you

“let us start, then; need witnesses.”
 
“very true,” said monte cristo; “it unnecessary, know other

“on contrary,” said count, “we know little other.”
 
“indeed?” said monte cristo, indomitable coolness; “let

“no, will go speak myself.” morrel went out, called
 baptistin, whispered words him. valet ran directly.
 
“well, sent?” asked monte cristo, seeing morrel return.
 
“yes, now shall calm.”

“and doctor answer?” asked monte cristo.
 
“he replied—he replied, death natural one, must

“to what?”
 
“to poison.”
 
“indeed!” said monte cristo slight cough moments of

 hear that?”
 
“yes, dear count, heard it; doctor added another

“well,” said maximilian, “death came third time, neither the

“my dear friend,” said monte cristo, “you appear relating an

morrel shuddered. something mournful, solemn, terrible in
 count’s manner.
 
“besides,” continued he, changed tone one have

“it returned, count,” exclaimed morrel; “that hastened to

“well, wish do? wish me, instance, give

“you know speak, count, not?”
 
“perfectly well, good friend; will prove putting

“you knew it?” cried morrel, paroxysm terror monte

 “you knew it, said nothing?”
 
“and me?” replied monte cristo, shrugging shoulders;
 “do know people? must lose one save other?

“but i,” cried morrel, groaning sorrow, “i love her!”

morrel groaned.
 
“come, come,” continued count, “complaints unavailing, a

 you.”
 
morrel shook head sorrowfully.
 
“i tell hope. understand me?” cried monte cristo.
 “remember never uttered falsehood never deceived. is

“how so?” cried morrel, “when left dying?”
 
monte cristo pressed hands forehead. passing in

monte cristo raised head more, time calm a

“oh, count, overwhelm coolness. you, then, power

seen quietly mademoiselle danglars mademoiselle
 d’armilly accomplished transformation flight; fact being
 everyone much occupied affairs think
 theirs.
 
will leave banker contemplating enormous magnitude his
 debt phantom bankruptcy, follow baroness, who
 momentarily crushed weight blow had
 struck her, gone seek usual adviser, lucien debray. the
 baroness looked forward marriage means ridding her
 guardianship which, girl eugénie’s character, not
 fail rather troublesome undertaking; tacit relations
 maintain bond family union, mother, maintain her
 ascendancy daughter, must never fail model wisdom
 type perfection.
 
now, madame danglars feared eugénie’s sagacity influence of
 mademoiselle d’armilly; frequently observed contemptuous
 expression daughter looked upon debray,—an expression
 seemed imply understood mother’s amorous and
 pecuniary relationships intimate secretary; moreover, saw
 eugénie detested debray, source of
 dissension scandal paternal roof, at
 classed catalogue bipeds plato endeavors to
 withdraw appellation men, diogenes designated as
 animals upon two legs without feathers.
 
unfortunately, world ours, person views things through
 certain medium, prevented seeing light as
 others, madame danglars, therefore, much regretted the
 marriage eugénie taken place, match was
 good, likely insure happiness child, it
 also set liberty. ran therefore debray, who, after
 having, like rest paris, witnessed contract scene the
 scandal attending it, retired haste club, was
 chatting friends upon events served subject of
 conversation three-fourths city known capital the
 world.
 
precise time madame danglars, dressed black and
 concealed long veil, ascending stairs leading debray’s
 apartments, notwithstanding assurances concierge the
 young man home, debray occupied repelling the
 insinuations friend, tried persuade the
 terrible scene just taken place ought, friend the
 family, marry mademoiselle danglars two millions. debray did
 defend warmly, idea sometimes crossed his
 mind; still, recollected independent, proud spirit of
 eugénie, positively rejected utterly impossible, though the
 thought continually recurred found resting-place in
 heart. tea, play, conversation, become
 interesting discussion serious affairs, lasted till
 one o’clock morning.
 
meanwhile madame danglars, veiled uneasy, awaited return of
 debray little green room, seated two baskets flowers,
 morning sent, which, must confessed,
 debray arranged watered much care his
 absence half excused eyes poor woman.
 
twenty minutes twelve, madame danglars, tired waiting,
 returned home. women certain grade like prosperous grisettes

 baroness returned hotel much caution eugénie used in

“mademoiselle eugénie,” said maid, “retired apartment with
 mademoiselle d’armilly; took tea together, they
 desired leave, saying needed longer.”
 
since maid below, like everyone else thought
 young ladies room; madame danglars, therefore,
 went bed without shadow suspicion, began muse the
 recent events. proportion memory became clearer, the
 occurrences evening revealed true light; she
 taken confusion tumult; regarded as
 something distressing, reality disgrace. baroness
 remembered felt pity poor mercédès, been
 afflicted severe blow husband son.
 
“eugénie,” said herself, “is lost, we. affair, as
 will reported, will cover us shame; society as
 satire inflicts painful incurable wound. fortunate that
 eugénie possessed strange character often made
 tremble!”
 
glance turned towards heaven, mysterious providence

baroness thought m. villefort. m. villefort

 baroness shaped mutual advantage. inflexibility

nine o’clock next morning arose, without ringing her
 maid giving least sign activity, dressed in

“forgive servants,” said, “for terror blame for;

madame danglars often heard terror magistrate

“you too, then, unhappy?” said.
 
“yes, madame,” replied magistrate.
 
“then pity me!”
 
“sincerely, madame.”
 
“and understand brings here?”
 
“you wish speak circumstance just

“yes, sir,—a fearful misfortune.”
 
“you mean mischance.”
 
“a mischance?” repeated baroness.
 
“alas, madame,” said procureur imperturbable calmness of

“and suppose will forgotten?”
 
“everything will forgotten, madame,” said villefort. “your daughter

“you late, madame; orders issued.”
 
“well, arrested—do think will arrest him?”
 
“i hope so.”
 
“if arrest (i know sometimes prisons afford means

procureur shook head.
 
“at least keep till daughter married.”
 
“impossible, madame; justice formalities.”
 
“what, even me?” said baroness, half jesting, half earnest.
 
“for all, even among rest,” replied villefort.

“ah!” exclaimed baroness, without expressing ideas the
 exclamation betrayed. villefort looked piercing glance

“yes, know mean,” said; “you refer terrible rumors

“i thinking that,” replied madame danglars quickly.
 
“yes, thinking it, justice. help
 thinking it, saying yourself, ‘you, pursue crime so
 vindictively, answer now, unpunished crimes your

 not?”
 
“well, it.”
 
“i will answer you.”
 
villefort drew armchair nearer madame danglars; resting
 hands upon desk said voice hollow usual:
 
“there crimes remain unpunished criminals are
 unknown, might strike innocent instead guilty; but
 culprits discovered” (villefort extended hand
 toward large crucifix placed opposite desk)—“when are

“but, sir, sure guilty say?”
 
“listen; description: ‘benedetto, condemned, age of

“and wretch?”
 
“who can tell?—a vagabond, corsican.”
 
“has one owned him?”
 
“no one; parents unknown.”
 
“but man brought lucca?”
 
“another rascal like himself, perhaps accomplice.” baroness
 clasped hands.
 
“villefort,” exclaimed softest captivating manner.
 
“for heaven’s sake, madame,” said villefort, firmness of

“but trampling weak, sir.”
 
“the weakness murderer!”
 
“his dishonor reflects upon us.”
 
“is death house?”
 
“oh, sir,” exclaimed baroness, “you without pity others,

“be so!” said villefort, raising arms heaven a

“at least, delay trial till next assizes; shall have

“because saved father’s life wished destroy

morrel made another step back, staggering, breathless, crushed; then

added “edmond dantès,” count seized arm and

“why so?” asked young man, surprised.
 
“i explain myself; watch him.” emmanuel looked around

 weapons, pointed them. monte cristo bent head. emmanuel
 went towards pistols.
 
“leave them,” said monte cristo. walking towards morrel, took

“come,” said monte-cristo, touching shoulder finger, “are

“yes; begin suffer again.”
 
count frowned, apparently gloomy hesitation.
 
“maximilian, maximilian,” said, “the ideas yield unworthy

“oh, fear, friend,” said morrel, raising head, and
 smiling sweet expression count; “i shall longer
 attempt life.”
 
“then pistols—no despair?”
 
“no; found better remedy grief either bullet or

“poor fellow, it?”
 
“my grief will kill itself.”
 
“my friend,” said monte cristo, expression melancholy equal

“look me,” said monte cristo, expression sometimes
 made eloquent persuasive—“look me. tears in

“oh, heavens,” said young man, “oh, heavens—what saying,
 count? take care. perhaps never loved!”
 
“child!” replied count.
 
“i mean, love. see, soldier ever since i

“hope, friend,” repeated count.
 
“ah,” said morrel, falling height excitement abyss
 despair—“ah, playing me, like good, rather
 selfish mothers soothe children honeyed words, because

“on contrary,” said count, “after time must live with

“and still bid hope?”
 
“i tell hope, method curing you.”
 
“count, render sadder before, possible. think

 dropped head disdainful incredulity.
 
“what can say more?” asked monte cristo. “i confidence the

“count, prolong agony.”
 
“then,” said count, “your feeble spirit will even grant the
 trial request? come—do know count monte cristo is
 capable? know holds terrestrial beings his

 miracle hope accomplish, or——”
 
“or?” repeated morrel.
 
“or, take care, morrel, lest call ungrateful.”
 
“have pity me, count!”
 
“i feel much pity towards you, maximilian, that—listen me
 attentively—if cure month, day, very

“will promise me?”
 
“yes; man, suffered like yourself, also
 contemplated suicide; indeed, often since misfortune left have
 longed delights eternal sleep.”
 
“but sure will promise this?” said morrel, intoxicated.
 
“i promise, swear it!” said monte cristo extending his
 hand.
 
“in month, then, honor, consoled, will let me
 take life hands, whatever may happen will not
 call ungrateful?”
 
“in month, day, hour date sacred one,
 maximilian. know whether remember 5th of

“in month will find table, shall then

“oh, also swear it!”
 
monte cristo drew young man towards him, pressed some

“haydée?” said morrel, “what become her?”
 
“she departed last night.”
 
“to leave you?”
 
“to wait me. hold ready join the

“are looking anything, mr. procureur?” asked benedetto, with
 ingratiating smile.
 
m. villefort answered nothing, sat, rather threw down

“and now, prisoner, will consent tell name?” said the
 president. “the brutal affectation enumerated and
 classified crimes calls severe reprimand part the
 court, name morality, respect due to

“well,” said president; “your name?”
 
“i tell name, since know it; know my

 fell face upon papers held convulsed hand.
 
“repeat father’s name,” said president.

 waited anxiously.
 
“my father king’s attorney,” replied andrea calmly.

“king’s attorney?” said president, stupefied, without noticing
 agitation spread face m. villefort; “king’s
 attorney?”
 
“yes; wish know name, will tell it,—he named
 villefort.”
 
explosion, long restrained feeling of
 respect court justice, now burst forth like thunder the

 lasted five minutes, door-keepers magistrates able
 restore silence. midst tumult voice of
 president heard exclaim:
 
“are playing justice, accused, dare set your
 fellow-citizens example disorder even times has

several persons hurried m. villefort, sat half bowed over

 smelling-bottle, recovered. scene of
 tumult, andrea turned smiling face towards assembly; then,
 leaning one hand oaken rail dock, most
 graceful attitude possible, said:
 
“gentlemen, assure idea insulting court, of
 making useless disturbance presence honorable
 assembly. ask age; tell it. ask born; i
 answer. ask name, give it, since parents abandoned

“gentlemen,” said andrea, commanding silence voice manner;
 “i owe proofs explanations said.”
 
“but,” said irritated president, “you called benedetto,
 declared orphan, claimed corsica country.”
 
“i said anything pleased, order solemn declaration have

 prisoner increased proportion terror m. villefort.
 
“but become acquainted details?” asked the
 president.
 
“i will tell you, mr. president. man sworn vengeance against
 father, long watched opportunity kill him, had
 introduced night garden father buried

 ground, stabbed him; thinking deposit might contain
 treasure turned ground, found still living. the
 man carried foundling asylum, registered under

 away. thus, see, though born paris, brought in
 corsica.”
 
moment’s silence, one fancied the
 hall empty, profound stillness.
 
“proceed,” said president.
 
“certainly, might lived happily amongst good people, who
 adored me, perverse disposition prevailed virtues which
 adopted mother endeavored instil heart. increased in

 ceased blaspheme, cursed father. uttered
 words blame me; filled whole
 assembly horror. committed additional crime, punish
 me, will allow ever since day birth fate

“but mother?” asked president.
 
“my mother thought dead; guilty. even wish to
 know name, know it.”
 
just piercing cry, ending sob, burst centre the
 crowd, encircled lady fainted, now fell
 violent fit hysterics. carried hall, the
 thick veil concealed face dropped off, madame danglars
 recognized. notwithstanding shattered nerves, ringing
 sensation ears, madness turned brain,
 villefort rose perceived her.
 
“the proofs, proofs!” said president; “remember tissue of
 horrors must supported clearest proofs.”
 
“the proofs?” said benedetto, laughing; “do want proofs?”
 
“yes.”
 
“well, then, look m. villefort, ask proofs.”
 
everyone turned towards procureur, who, unable bear the
 universal gaze now riveted alone, advanced staggering the
 midst tribunal, hair dishevelled face indented
 mark nails. whole assembly uttered long murmur of
 astonishment.
 
“father,” said benedetto, “i asked proofs, wish to
 give them?”
 
“no, no, useless,” stammered m. villefort hoarse voice;
 “no, useless!”
 
“how useless?” cried president, “what mean?”
 
“i mean feel impossible struggle deadly
 weight crushes me. gentlemen, know hands an
 avenging god! need proofs; everything relating young man

dull, gloomy silence, like precedes awful phenomenon

“what, m. villefort,” cried president, “do yield an
 hallucination? what, longer possession senses?
 strange, unexpected, terrible accusation disordered your
 reason. come, recover.”
 
procureur dropped head; teeth chattered like man
 violent attack fever, yet deadly pale.
 
“i possession senses, sir,” said; “my body alone
 suffers, may suppose. acknowledge guilty the
 young man brought me, hour hold under
 authority procureur will succeed me.”
 
spoke words hoarse, choking voice, staggered
 towards door, mechanically opened door-keeper. the
 whole assembly dumb astonishment revelation and
 confession produced catastrophe different that
 expected last fortnight parisian

“well,” said beauchamp, “let now say drama unnatural!”
 
“_ma foi!_” said château-renaud, “i rather end career like m.
 morcerf; pistol-shot seems quite delightful compared this
 catastrophe.”
 
“and moreover, kills,” said beauchamp.
 
“and think idea marrying daughter,” said
 debray. “she well die, poor girl!”
 
“the sitting adjourned, gentlemen,” said president; “fresh
 inquiries will made, case will tried next session by
 another magistrate.”
 
andrea, calm interesting ever, left the
 hall, escorted gendarmes, involuntarily paid attention.
 
“well, think this, fine fellow?” asked debray the
 sergeant-at-arms, slipping louis hand.
 
“there will extenuating circumstances,” replied.

 “and let live here; ask liberty—i ask live!”
 
“then suffer great deal?”
 
“oh, yes, yes, cruelly!”
 
“still, men suffered you.”
 
“i think so.”
 
“yes; died hunger.”
 
danglars thought old man whom, hours delirium, had

“do repent?” asked deep, solemn voice, caused danglars’

“why spend last three hours remaining us life,
 like ancient romans, condemned nero, emperor

morrel smiled. “as please,” said; “death always death,—that
 forgetfulness, repose, exclusion life, therefore from
 grief.”

 baskets heads always filled fruits flowers. morrel
 looked carelessly around, probably noticed nothing.
 
“let us talk like men,” said, looking count.
 
“go on!”

monte cristo looked upon morrel indescribable tenderness. “yes,”
 said, “yes, doubtless painful, violently break the

“and wished die, choose death, count?”
 
“yes.”
 
morrel extended hand. “now understand,” said, “why me

“do regret nothing?”
 
“no,” replied morrel.
 
“not even me?” asked count deep emotion. morrel’s clear eye
 moment clouded, shone unusual lustre, a
 large tear rolled cheek.
 
“what,” said count, “do still regret anything world, and
 yet die?”
 
“oh, entreat you,” exclaimed morrel low voice, “do speak
 another word, count; prolong punishment.”
