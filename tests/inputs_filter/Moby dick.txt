chapter 2. carpet-bag.
 
stuffed shirt two old carpet-bag, tucked my
 arm, started cape horn pacific. quitting good city
 old manhatto, duly arrived new bedford. saturday night

 packet nantucket already sailed, way reaching

young candidates pains penalties whaling stop at

 related i, one, idea doing. mind was
 made sail nantucket craft, a
 fine, boisterous something everything connected famous
 old island, amazingly pleased me. besides though new bedford has
 late gradually monopolising business whaling, though
 matter poor old nantucket now much behind her, yet nantucket
 great original—the tyre carthage;—the place the
 first dead american whale stranded. else nantucket
 aboriginal whalemen, red-men, first sally canoes
 give chase leviathan? nantucket, too, did
 first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with
 imported cobblestones—so goes story—to throw whales, in
 order discover nigh enough risk harpoon the
 bowsprit?
 
now night, day, still another night following me
 new bedford, ere embark destined port, became a
 matter concernment eat sleep meanwhile. a
 dubious-looking, nay, dark dismal night, bitingly cold
 cheerless. knew one place. anxious grapnels had
 sounded pocket, brought pieces silver,—so,
 wherever go, ishmael, said myself, stood middle of
 dreary street shouldering bag, comparing gloom towards the
 north darkness towards south—wherever wisdom you
 may conclude lodge night, dear ishmael, sure to
 inquire price, don’t particular.
 
halting steps paced streets, passed sign “the
 crossed harpoons”—but looked expensive jolly there. further
 on, bright red windows “sword-fish inn,” came
 fervent rays, seemed melted packed snow and
 ice house, everywhere else congealed frost lay
 ten inches thick hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary me,
 struck foot flinty projections, from
 hard, remorseless service soles boots most
 miserable plight. expensive jolly, thought i, pausing one
 moment watch broad glare street, hear sounds of
 tinkling glasses within. go on, ishmael, said last; don’t
 hear? get away door; patched boots are
 stopping way. went. now instinct followed streets
 took waterward, there, doubtless, cheapest, not
 cheeriest inns.
 
dreary streets! blocks blackness, houses, either hand,
 candle, like candle moving tomb. at
 hour night, last day week, quarter of
 town proved deserted. presently came smoky light
 proceeding low, wide building, door stood
 invitingly open. careless look, meant the
 uses public; so, entering, first thing stumble
 ash-box porch. ha! thought i, ha, flying
 particles almost choked me, ashes destroyed city,
 gomorrah? “the crossed harpoons,” “the sword-fish?”—this, then
 must needs sign “the trap.” however, picked and
 hearing loud voice within, pushed opened second, interior
 door.
 
seemed great black parliament sitting tophet. hundred black
 faces turned round rows peer; beyond, black angel of
 doom beating book pulpit. negro church; the
 preacher’s text blackness darkness, weeping
 wailing teeth-gnashing there. ha, ishmael, muttered i, backing
 out, wretched entertainment sign ‘the trap!’
 
moving on, last came dim sort light far the
 docks, heard forlorn creaking air; looking up, saw a
 swinging sign door white painting upon it, faintly
 representing tall straight jet misty spray, words
 underneath—“the spouter inn:—peter coffin.”
 
coffin?—spouter?—rather ominous particular connexion, thought
 i. common name nantucket, say, suppose this
 peter emigrant there. light looked dim, and
 place, time, looked quiet enough, dilapidated
 little wooden house looked might carted here

 poverty-stricken sort creak it, thought very
 spot cheap lodgings, best pea coffee.
 
queer sort place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied
 were, leaning sadly. stood sharp bleak corner,
 tempestuous wind euroclydon kept worse howling than
 ever poor paul’s tossed craft. euroclydon, nevertheless,
 mighty pleasant zephyr one in-doors, feet the
 hob quietly toasting bed. “in judging tempestuous wind
 called euroclydon,” says old writer—of whose works possess the
 copy extant—“it maketh marvellous difference, whether thou
 lookest glass window frost the
 outside, whether thou observest sashless window, where
 frost sides, wight death only
 glazier.” true enough, thought i, passage occurred my
 mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. yes, eyes are
 windows, body mine house. pity didn’t
 stop chinks crannies though, thrust little lint
 there. it’s late make improvements now. the
 universe finished; copestone on, chips carted
 million years ago. poor lazarus there, chattering teeth
 curbstone pillow, shaking tatters with
 shiverings, might plug ears rags, put a
 corn-cob mouth, yet keep the
 tempestuous euroclydon. euroclydon! says old dives, red silken
 wrapper—(he redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! fine frosty
 night; orion glitters; northern lights! let talk their
 oriental summer climes everlasting conservatories; give the
 privilege making summer coals.
 
thinks lazarus? can warm blue hands holding up
 grand northern lights? lazarus rather sumatra
 here? far rather lay lengthwise along the
 line equator; yea, ye gods! go fiery pit itself, in
 order keep frost?
 
now, lazarus lie stranded curbstone the
 door dives, wonderful iceberg be

 czar ice palace made frozen sighs, president a
 temperance society, drinks tepid tears orphans.
 
blubbering now, going a-whaling, there
 plenty yet come. let us scrape ice frosted
 feet, see sort place “spouter” may be.
 

chapter 3. spouter-inn.
 
entering gable-ended spouter-inn, found wide,
 low, straggling entry old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of
 bulwarks condemned old craft. one side hung large
 oilpainting thoroughly besmoked, every way defaced, the
 unequal crosslights viewed it, diligent
 study series systematic visits it, careful inquiry of
 neighbors, way arrive understanding its
 purpose. unaccountable masses shades shadows, first
 almost thought ambitious young artist, time new

 much earnest contemplation, oft repeated ponderings, and
 especially throwing open little window towards back the
 entry, last come conclusion idea, however
 wild, might altogether unwarranted.
 
puzzled confounded long, limber,
 portentous, black mass something hovering centre the
 picture three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating a
 nameless yeast. boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough drive
 nervous man distracted. yet sort indefinite,
 half-attained, unimaginable sublimity fairly froze to
 it, till involuntarily took oath find what
 marvellous painting meant. ever anon bright, but, alas,
 deceptive idea dart through.—it’s black midnight
 gale.—it’s unnatural combat four primal elements.—it’s a
 blasted heath.—it’s hyperborean winter scene.—it’s breaking-up of
 icebound stream time. last fancies yielded to
 one portentous something picture’s midst. _that_ found
 out, rest plain. stop; bear faint
 resemblance gigantic fish? even great leviathan himself?
 
fact, artist’s design seemed this: final theory own,
 partly based upon aggregated opinions many aged persons with
 conversed upon subject. picture represents cape-horner
 great hurricane; half-foundered ship weltering its
 three dismantled masts alone visible; exasperated whale,
 purposing spring clean craft, enormous act of
 impaling upon three mast-heads.
 
opposite wall entry hung heathenish
 array monstrous clubs spears. thickly set with
 glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others tufted knots
 human hair; one sickle-shaped, vast handle sweeping
 round like segment made new-mown grass long-armed
 mower. shuddered gazed, wondered monstrous cannibal

 sojourning body man, travelled full forty feet, last
 found imbedded hump.
 
crossing dusky entry, yon low-arched way—cut
 old times must great central chimney with
 fireplaces round—you enter public room. still duskier place
 this, low ponderous beams above, old wrinkled
 planks beneath, almost fancy trod old craft’s
 cockpits, especially howling night, corner-anchored
 old ark rocked furiously. one side stood long, low, shelf-like
 table covered cracked glass cases, filled dusty rarities
 gathered wide world’s remotest nooks. projecting the
 angle room stands dark-looking den—the bar—a rude
 attempt right whale’s head. may, stands the
 vast arched bone whale’s jaw, wide, coach might almost
 drive beneath it. within shabby shelves, ranged round old
 decanters, bottles, flasks; jaws swift destruction,
 like another cursed jonah (by name indeed called him),
 bustles little withered old man, who, money, dearly sells
 sailors deliriums death.
 
abominable tumblers pours poison. though true
 cylinders without—within, villanous green goggling glasses
 deceitfully tapered downwards cheating bottom. parallel meridians
 rudely pecked glass, surround footpads’ goblets. fill to
 _this_ mark, charge penny; _this_ penny more;
 full glass—the cape horn measure, may gulp

upon entering place found number young seamen gathered about
 table, examining dim light divers specimens _skrimshander_. i
 sought landlord, telling desired accommodated with
 room, received answer house full—not bed
 unoccupied. “but avast,” added, tapping forehead, “you haint no
 objections sharing harpooneer’s blanket, ye? s’pose are
 goin’ a-whalin’, you’d better get used sort thing.”
 
told never liked sleep two bed; should
 ever so, depend upon harpooneer might be, that

 harpooneer decidedly objectionable, rather wander

 half decent man’s blanket.
 
“i thought so. right; take seat. supper?—you want supper?
 supper’ll ready directly.”
 
sat old wooden settle, carved like bench the
 battery. one end ruminating tar still adorning with
 jack-knife, stooping diligently working away space
 legs. trying hand ship full sail, but
 didn’t make much headway, thought.
 
last four five us summoned meal an
 adjoining room. cold iceland—no fire all—the landlord said
 couldn’t afford it. nothing two dismal tallow candles, a
 winding sheet. fain button monkey jackets, hold
 lips cups scalding tea half frozen fingers. the
 fare substantial kind—not meat potatoes, but
 dumplings; good heavens! dumplings supper! one young fellow a
 green box coat, addressed dumplings direful
 manner.
 
“my boy,” said landlord, “you’ll nightmare dead
 sartainty.”
 
“landlord,” whispered, “that aint harpooneer it?”
 
“oh, no,” said he, looking sort diabolically funny, “the
 harpooneer dark complexioned chap. never eats dumplings, he
 don’t—he eats nothing steaks, likes ’em rare.”
 
“the devil does,” says i. “where harpooneer? here?”
 
“he’ll afore long,” answer.
 
help it, began feel suspicious “dark
 complexioned” harpooneer. rate, made mind so
 turned sleep together, must undress get into
 bed did.
 
supper over, company went back bar-room, when, knowing not
 else myself, resolved spend rest the
 evening looker on.
 
presently rioting noise heard without. starting up, landlord
 cried, “that’s grampus’s crew. seed reported offing
 morning; three years’ voyage, full ship. hurrah, boys; now
 we’ll latest news feegees.”
 
tramping boots heard entry; door flung
 open, rolled wild set mariners enough. enveloped their
 shaggy watch coats, heads muffled woollen comforters,
 bedarned ragged, beards stiff icicles, they
 seemed eruption bears labrador. just landed from
 boat, first house entered. wonder, then,
 made straight wake whale’s mouth—the bar—when the
 wrinkled little old jonah, officiating, soon poured out
 brimmers round. one complained bad cold head, upon

 swore sovereign cure colds catarrhs whatsoever, never

liquor soon mounted heads, generally even
 arrantest topers newly landed sea, began
 capering obstreperously.
 
observed, however, one held somewhat aloof, though
 seemed desirous spoil hilarity shipmates his
 sober face, yet upon whole refrained making much
 noise rest. man interested once; since the
 sea-gods ordained soon become shipmate (though
 sleeping-partner one, far narrative concerned), i
 will venture upon little description him. stood full six
 feet height, noble shoulders, chest like coffer-dam. i
 seldom seen brawn man. face deeply brown and
 burnt, making white teeth dazzling contrast; the
 deep shadows eyes floated reminiscences seem
 give much joy. voice announced a
 southerner, fine stature, thought must one of
 tall mountaineers alleghanian ridge virginia. when
 revelry companions mounted height, man
 slipped away unobserved, saw till became my
 comrade sea. minutes, however, missed his
 shipmates, being, seems, reason huge favourite with
 them, raised cry “bulkington! bulkington! where’s
 bulkington?” darted house pursuit him.
 
now nine o’clock, room seeming almost
 supernaturally quiet orgies, began congratulate myself
 upon little plan occurred just previous the
 entrance seamen.
 
man prefers sleep two bed. fact, good deal
 rather sleep brother. don’t know is, but
 people like private sleeping. comes to
 sleeping unknown stranger, strange inn, strange town,
 stranger harpooneer, objections indefinitely
 multiply. earthly reason sailor should
 sleep two bed, anybody else; sailors sleep
 two bed sea, bachelor kings ashore. sure all
 sleep together one apartment, hammock, and
 cover blanket, sleep skin.
 
pondered harpooneer, abominated the
 thought sleeping him. fair presume a
 harpooneer, linen woollen, case might be, of
 tidiest, certainly none finest. began twitch over.
 besides, getting late, decent harpooneer home
 going bedwards. suppose now, tumble upon at
 midnight—how tell vile hole coming?
 
“landlord! i’ve changed mind harpooneer.—i shan’t sleep
 him. i’ll try bench here.”
 
“just please; i’m sorry can’t spare ye tablecloth a
 mattress, it’s plaguy rough board here”—feeling knots and
 notches. “but wait bit, skrimshander; i’ve got carpenter’s plane
 bar—wait, say, i’ll make ye snug enough.” saying
 procured plane; old silk handkerchief first dusting
 bench, vigorously set planing away bed, grinning
 like ape. shavings flew right left; till last the
 plane-iron came bump indestructible knot. landlord was
 near spraining wrist, told heaven’s sake quit—the
 bed soft enough suit me, know planing
 world make eider pine plank. gathering the
 shavings another grin, throwing great stove in
 middle room, went business, left a
 brown study.
 
now took measure bench, found foot too
 short; mended chair. foot too
 narrow, bench room four inches higher
 planed one—so yoking them. placed the
 first bench lengthwise along clear space wall,
 leaving little interval between, back settle in. i
 soon found came draught cold air from
 sill window, plan never all,
 especially another current rickety door met one from
 window, together formed series small whirlwinds in
 immediate vicinity spot thought spend the
 night.
 
devil fetch harpooneer, thought i, stop, couldn’t steal
 march him—bolt door inside, jump bed, be
 wakened violent knockings? seemed bad idea; upon
 second thoughts dismissed it. tell next
 morning, soon popped room, harpooneer might be
 standing entry, ready knock down!
 
still, looking round again, seeing possible chance of
 spending sufferable night unless person’s bed, began
 think might cherishing unwarrantable prejudices
 unknown harpooneer. thinks i, i’ll wait awhile; must be
 dropping long. i’ll good look then, perhaps
 may become jolly good bedfellows all—there’s telling.
 
though boarders kept coming ones, twos, threes,
 going bed, yet sign harpooneer.
 
“landlord!” said i, “what sort chap he—does always keep such
 late hours?” now hard upon twelve o’clock.
 
landlord chuckled lean chuckle, seemed be
 mightily tickled something beyond comprehension. “no,” he
 answered, “generally he’s early bird—airley bed airley to
 rise—yes, he’s bird catches worm. to-night went out
 peddling, see, don’t see airth keeps late,
 unless, may be, can’t sell head.”
 
“can’t sell head?—what sort bamboozingly story are
 telling me?” getting towering rage. “do pretend say,
 landlord, harpooneer actually engaged blessed
 saturday night, rather sunday morning, peddling head around
 town?”
 
“that’s precisely it,” said landlord, “and told couldn’t
 sell here, market’s overstocked.”
 
“with what?” shouted i.
 
“with heads sure; ain’t many heads world?”
 
“i tell is, landlord,” said quite calmly, “you’d better
 stop spinning yarn me—i’m green.”
 
“may not,” taking stick whittling toothpick, “but i
 rayther guess you’ll done _brown_ ere harpooneer hears a
 slanderin’ head.”
 
“i’ll break him,” said i, now flying passion at
 unaccountable farrago landlord’s.
 
“it’s broke a’ready,” said he.
 
“broke,” said i—“_broke_, mean?”
 
“sartain, that’s reason can’t sell it, guess.”
 
“landlord,” said i, going cool mt. hecla a
 snow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. must understand one
 another, without delay. come house want a
 bed; tell can give half one; half
 belongs certain harpooneer. harpooneer, have
 yet seen, persist telling mystifying and
 exasperating stories tending beget uncomfortable feeling
 towards man design bedfellow—a sort connexion,
 landlord, intimate confidential one highest

 harpooneer is, whether shall respects safe spend the
 night him. first place, will good unsay
 story selling head, true take good
 evidence harpooneer stark mad, i’ve idea of
 sleeping madman; you, sir, _you_ mean, landlord, _you_,
 sir, trying induce knowingly, thereby render
 liable criminal prosecution.”
 
“wall,” said landlord, fetching long breath, “that’s purty long
 sarmon chap rips little now then. easy, be
 easy, harpooneer tellin’ just arrived
 south seas, bought lot ’balmed new zealand
 heads (great curios, know), he’s sold ’em one, and
 one he’s trying sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s sunday, it
 sellin’ human heads streets folks is
 goin’ churches. wanted to, last sunday, stopped just as
 goin’ door four heads strung string, for
 airth like string inions.”
 
account cleared otherwise unaccountable mystery, showed
 landlord, all, idea fooling me—but the
 time think harpooneer stayed a
 saturday night clean holy sabbath, engaged cannibal
 business selling heads dead idolators?
 
“depend upon it, landlord, harpooneer dangerous man.”
 
“he pays reg’lar,” rejoinder. “but come, it’s getting dreadful
 late, better turning flukes—it’s nice bed; sal me
 slept ere bed night spliced. there’s plenty room
 two kick bed; it’s almighty big bed that. why,
 afore give up, sal used put sam little johnny the

 somehow, sam got pitched floor, came near breaking arm.
 arter that, sal said wouldn’t do. come along here, i’ll give ye a

 me, offering lead way. stood irresolute; looking a
 clock corner, exclaimed “i vum it’s sunday—you won’t see that
 harpooneer to-night; he’s come anchor somewhere—come along then;
 _do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”
 
considered matter moment, stairs went, was
 ushered small room, cold clam, furnished, sure enough,
 prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed four
 harpooneers sleep abreast.
 
“there,” said landlord, placing candle crazy old chest
 double duty wash-stand centre table; “there, make
 comfortable now, good night ye.” turned round from
 eyeing bed, disappeared.
 
folding back counterpane, stooped bed. though none of
 elegant, yet stood scrutiny tolerably well. then
 glanced round room; besides bedstead centre table,
 see furniture belonging place, rude shelf,
 four walls, papered fireboard representing man striking a
 whale. things properly belonging room, a
 hammock lashed up, thrown upon floor one corner; also a
 large seaman’s bag, containing harpooneer’s wardrobe, doubt in
 lieu land trunk. likewise, parcel outlandish bone
 fish hooks shelf fire-place, tall harpoon
 standing head bed.
 
chest? took up, held close the
 light, felt it, smelt it, tried every way possible to
 arrive satisfactory conclusion concerning it. can compare it
 nothing large door mat, ornamented edges little
 tinkling tags something like stained porcupine quills round an
 indian moccasin. hole slit middle mat, as
 see south american ponchos. possible
 sober harpooneer get door mat, parade the

 try it, weighed like hamper, uncommonly shaggy

sat side bed, commenced thinking this
 head-peddling harpooneer, door mat. thinking time on
 bed-side, got took monkey jacket, stood in
 middle room thinking. took coat, thought a

 half undressed was, remembering landlord said about
 harpooneer’s coming home night, very
 late, made ado, jumped pantaloons boots,
 blowing light tumbled bed, commended myself
 care heaven.
 
whether mattress stuffed corn-cobs broken crockery,
 telling, rolled good deal, not
 sleep long time. last slid light doze, had
 pretty nearly made good offing towards land nod, heard
 heavy footfall passage, saw glimmer light come into
 room door.
 
lord save me, thinks i, must harpooneer, infernal
 head-peddler. lay perfectly still, resolved say word
 till spoken to. holding light one hand, identical new
 zealand head other, stranger entered room, without
 looking towards bed, placed candle good way on
 floor one corner, began working away knotted
 cords large bag spoke room. was
 eagerness see face, kept averted time
 employed unlacing bag’s mouth. accomplished, however,
 turned round—when, good heavens! sight! face! was
 dark, purplish, yellow colour, stuck with
 large blackish looking squares. yes, it’s just thought, he’s a
 terrible bedfellow; he’s fight, got dreadfully cut, here
 is, just surgeon. moment chanced turn his
 face towards light, plainly saw be
 sticking-plasters all, black squares cheeks. were
 stains sort other. first knew make this;
 soon inkling truth occurred me. remembered story
 white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among cannibals, had
 tattooed them. concluded harpooneer, course
 distant voyages, must met similar adventure. and
 it, thought i, all! it’s outside; man can be
 honest sort skin. then, make unearthly
 complexion, part it, mean, lying round about, completely
 independent squares tattooing. sure, might be
 nothing good coat tropical tanning; never heard hot
 sun’s tanning white man purplish yellow one. however, had
 never south seas; perhaps sun produced these
 extraordinary effects upon skin. now, ideas were
 passing like lightning, harpooneer never noticed at
 all. but, difficulty opened bag, commenced
 fumbling it, presently pulled sort tomahawk, a
 seal-skin wallet hair on. placing old chest in
 middle room, took new zealand head—a ghastly
 thing enough—and crammed bag. now took his
 hat—a new beaver hat—when came nigh singing fresh surprise.
 hair head—none speak least—nothing a
 small scalp-knot twisted forehead. bald purplish head now
 looked world like mildewed skull. stranger
 stood door, bolted quicker
 ever bolted dinner.
 
even was, thought something slipping window, but
 second floor back. coward, make this
 head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed comprehension.
 ignorance parent fear, completely nonplussed and
 confounded stranger, confess now much afraid of
 devil thus broken room at
 dead night. fact, afraid game
 enough just address him, demand satisfactory answer
 concerning seemed inexplicable him.
 
meanwhile, continued business undressing, last showed
 chest arms. live, covered parts were
 checkered squares face; back, too, all
 dark squares; seemed thirty years’
 war, just escaped sticking-plaster shirt. still
 more, legs marked, parcel dark green frogs
 running trunks young palms. now quite plain that
 must abominable savage shipped aboard whaleman
 south seas, landed christian country. quaked to
 think it. peddler heads too—perhaps heads own
 brothers. might take fancy mine—heavens! look tomahawk!
 
time shuddering, now savage went about
 something completely fascinated attention, convinced me
 must indeed heathen. going heavy grego, wrapall,
 dreadnaught, previously hung chair, fumbled in
 pockets, produced length curious little deformed image
 hunch back, exactly colour three days’ old
 congo baby. remembering embalmed head, first almost thought
 black manikin real baby preserved similar
 manner. seeing limber, glistened
 good deal like polished ebony, concluded must nothing
 wooden idol, indeed proved be. now savage
 goes empty fire-place, removing papered fire-board,
 sets little hunch-backed image, like tenpin, the
 andirons. chimney jambs bricks inside sooty,
 thought fire-place made appropriate little shrine
 chapel congo idol.
 
now screwed eyes hard towards half hidden image, feeling but
 ill ease meantime—to see next follow. first takes
 double handful shavings grego pocket, places
 carefully idol; laying bit ship biscuit on
 top applying flame lamp, kindled shavings into
 sacrificial blaze. presently, many hasty snatches the
 fire, still hastier withdrawals fingers (whereby seemed
 scorching badly), last succeeded drawing the
 biscuit; blowing heat ashes little, made polite
 offer little negro. little devil seem to
 fancy dry sort fare all; never moved lips. these
 strange antics accompanied still stranger guttural noises from
 devotee, seemed praying sing-song else singing
 pagan psalmody other, face twitched in
 unnatural manner. last extinguishing fire, took the
 idol unceremoniously, bagged grego pocket
 carelessly sportsman bagging dead woodcock.
 
queer proceedings increased uncomfortableness, seeing
 now exhibiting strong symptoms concluding business
 operations, jumping bed me, thought high time,
 now never, light put out, break spell which
 long bound.
 
interval spent deliberating say, fatal one.
 taking tomahawk table, examined head for
 instant, holding light, mouth the
 handle, puffed great clouds tobacco smoke. next moment
 light extinguished, wild cannibal, tomahawk between
 teeth, sprang bed me. sang out, help it
 now; giving sudden grunt astonishment began feeling me.
 
stammering something, knew what, rolled away him
 wall, conjured him, whoever whatever might
 be, keep quiet, let get light lamp again. his
 guttural responses satisfied ill comprehended my
 meaning.
 
“who-e debel you?”—he last said—“you speak-e, dam-me, kill-e.”
 saying lighted tomahawk began flourishing the
 dark.
 
“landlord, god’s sake, peter coffin!” shouted i. “landlord! watch!
 coffin! angels! save me!”
 
“speak-e! tell-ee who-ee be, dam-me, kill-e!” growled the
 cannibal, horrid flourishings tomahawk scattered the
 hot tobacco ashes till thought linen get fire.
 thank heaven, moment landlord came room light
 hand, leaping bed ran him.

 maintained profound silence. that, looked
 embarrassed. yes, set sea-dogs, many without the
 slightest bashfulness boarded great whales high seas—entire
 strangers them—and duelled dead without winking; yet, here
 sat social breakfast table—all calling, of
 kindred tastes—looking round sheepishly though they
 never sight sheepfold among green
 mountains. curious sight; bashful bears, timid warrior
 whalemen!
 
queequeg—why, queequeg sat among them—at head of

 cordially justified bringing harpoon breakfast him,

 sailors; new bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting street

 flesh. makes stranger stare.
 
but, besides feegeeans, tongatobooarrs, erromanggoans, pannangians,
 brighggians, and, besides wild specimens whaling-craft
 unheeded reel streets, will see sights still
 curious, certainly comical. weekly arrive town

 like canaan; land, also, corn wine. streets run

 yet, spite this, nowhere america will find more
 patrician-like houses; parks gardens opulent, new
 bedford. whence came they? planted upon scraggy scoria of

returning first morning stroll, sallied upon this
 special errand. sky changed clear, sunny cold, driving
 sleet mist. wrapping shaggy jacket cloth called
 bearskin, fought way stubborn storm. entering, found
 small scattered congregation sailors, sailors’ wives and
 widows. muffled silence reigned, broken times shrieks
 storm. silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart

 incommunicable. chaplain yet arrived; these
 silent islands men women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble
 tablets, black borders, masoned wall either side the

oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath green grass; standing

chapter 8. pulpit.
 
seated long ere man certain venerable
 robustness entered; immediately storm-pelted door flew back upon
 admitting him, quick regardful eyeing congregation,
 sufficiently attested fine old man chaplain. yes, it
 famous father mapple, called whalemen, among he
 great favourite. sailor harpooneer in
 youth, many years past dedicated life the
 ministry. time now write of, father mapple hardy

 second flowering youth, among fissures his

 when, arrayed decent suit, quietly approached pulpit.
 
like old fashioned pulpits, lofty one, since a
 regular stairs height would, long angle the
 floor, seriously contract already small area chapel, the
 architect, seemed, acted upon hint father mapple, and
 finished pulpit without stairs, substituting perpendicular side
 ladder, like used mounting ship boat sea. wife
 whaling captain provided chapel handsome pair of
 red worsted man-ropes ladder, which, nicely
 headed, stained mahogany colour, whole contrivance,
 considering manner chapel was, seemed means bad
 taste. halting instant foot ladder, both
 hands grasping ornamental knobs man-ropes, father mapple
 cast look upwards, truly sailor-like still
 reverential dexterity, hand hand, mounted steps if
 ascending main-top vessel.
 
perpendicular parts side ladder, usually case
 swinging ones, cloth-covered rope, rounds of
 wood, every step joint. first glimpse of

 impregnable little quebec.

 adorned large painting representing gallant ship beating
 terrible storm lee coast black rocks snowy

 seemed say, “beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, bear hardy

pulpit without trace sea-taste that
 achieved ladder picture. panelled front the

 projecting piece scroll work, fashioned ship’s fiddle-headed
 beak.
 
full meaning?—for pulpit ever earth’s

 world. thence storm god’s quick wrath first
 descried, bow must bear earliest brunt. thence is
 god breezes fair foul first invoked favourable winds.
 yes, world’s ship passage out, voyage complete;

 large brown hands across chest, uplifted closed eyes, and
 offered prayer deeply devout seemed kneeling praying

 commenced reading following hymn; changing manner towards

“i saw opening maw hell, endless pains sorrows there;

“with speed flew relief, radiant dolphin borne;

“my song ever shall record terrible, joyful hour; i
 give glory god, mercy power.”
 



nearly joined singing hymn, swelled high the
 howling storm. brief pause ensued; preacher slowly turned

 stuff; though sadly vitiated, fear, cannibal propensity he

 wild desire visit christendom, captain last relented, and

chapter 13. wheelbarrow.
 
next morning, monday, disposing embalmed head barber,

 comrade’s money. grinning landlord, well boarders, seemed
 amazingly tickled sudden friendship sprung between
 queequeg—especially peter coffin’s cock bull stories
 previously much alarmed concerning person
 now companied with.
 
borrowed wheelbarrow, embarking things, including own
 poor carpet-bag, queequeg’s canvas sack hammock, away went
 “the moss,” little nantucket packet schooner moored the
 wharf. going along people stared; queequeg so
 much—for used seeing cannibals like their
 streets,—but seeing upon confidential terms. we
 heeded not, going along wheeling barrow turns, queequeg
 now stopping adjust sheath harpoon barbs. i
 asked carried troublesome thing ashore, and
 whether whaling ships find harpoons. this, in
 substance, replied, though hinted true enough, yet
 particular affection harpoon, of
 assured stuff, well tried many mortal combat, deeply intimate
 hearts whales. short, like many inland reapers and
 mowers, go farmers’ meadows armed own
 scythes—though wise obliged furnish them—even so, queequeg,
 private reasons, preferred harpoon.
 
shifting barrow hand his, told funny story about
 first wheelbarrow ever seen. sag harbor. the
 owners ship, seems, lent one, carry his
 heavy chest boarding house. seem ignorant the
 thing—though truth entirely so, concerning precise way in
 manage barrow—queequeg puts chest upon it; lashes it
 fast; shoulders barrow marches wharf. “why,”
 said i, “queequeg, might known better that, one would
 think. didn’t people laugh?”
 
upon this, told another story. people island of
 rokovoko, seems, wedding feasts express fragrant water
 young cocoanuts large stained calabash like punchbowl; and
 punchbowl always forms great central ornament braided
 mat feast held. now certain grand merchant ship once
 touched rokovoko, commander—from accounts, very
 stately punctilious gentleman, least captain—this
 commander invited wedding feast queequeg’s sister, a
 pretty young princess just turned ten. well; wedding
 guests assembled bride’s bamboo cottage, captain
 marches in, assigned post honor, placed over
 punchbowl, high priest majesty the
 king, queequeg’s father. grace said,—for people their
 grace well we—though queequeg told unlike us, such
 times look downwards platters, they, contrary, copying
 ducks, glance upwards great giver feasts—grace, i
 say, said, high priest opens banquet immemorial
 ceremony island; is, dipping consecrated and
 consecrating fingers bowl blessed beverage
 circulates. seeing placed next priest, noting the
 ceremony, thinking himself—being captain ship—as plain
 precedence mere island king, especially king’s own
 house—the captain coolly proceeds wash hands the
 punchbowl;—taking suppose huge finger-glass. “now,” said
 queequeg, “what tink now?—didn’t people laugh?”
 
last, passage paid, luggage safe, stood board the
 schooner. hoisting sail, glided acushnet river. one

 glittering clear, cold air. huge hills mountains of

 young saplings mimicking behind back. thought bumpkin’s

“capting! capting!” yelled bumpkin, running towards officer;
 “capting, capting, here’s devil.”
 
“hallo, _you_ sir,” cried captain, gaunt rib sea, stalking

“what say?” said queequeg, mildly turned me.
 
“he say,” said i, “that came near kill-e man there,” pointing

“kill-e,” cried queequeg, twisting tattooed face unearthly

 small-e fish-e; queequeg kill-e big whale!”
 
“look you,” roared captain, “i’ll kill-e _you_, cannibal, if

happened just then, high time captain to
 mind eye. prodigious strain upon main-sail parted

 asked water—fresh water—something wipe brine off; that
 done, put dry clothes, lighted pipe, leaning the
 bulwarks, mildly eyeing around him, seemed saying to
 himself—“it’s mutual, joint-stock world, meridians. we
 cannibals must help christians.”
 

chapter 14. nantucket.
 
nothing happened passage worthy mentioning; so, a
 fine run, safely arrived nantucket.
 
nantucket! take map look it. see real corner of
 world occupies; stands there, away shore, lonely
 eddystone lighthouse. look it—a mere hillock, elbow of
 sand; beach, without background. sand than
 use twenty years substitute blotting paper. some
 gamesome wights will tell plant weeds there, they
 don’t grow naturally; import canada thistles; have
 send beyond seas spile stop leak oil cask; that
 pieces wood nantucket carried like bits true
 cross rome; people plant toadstools houses,
 get shade summer time; one blade grass makes an
 oasis, three blades day’s walk prairie; wear quicksand
 shoes, something like laplander snow-shoes; shut up,
 belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, made utter island
 ocean, chairs tables small clams will
 sometimes found adhering, backs turtles. these
 extravaganzas show nantucket illinois.
 
look now wondrous traditional story island was
 settled red-men. thus goes legend. olden times eagle
 swooped upon new england coast, carried infant
 indian talons. loud lament parents saw child
 borne sight wide waters. resolved follow the
 direction. setting canoes, perilous passage
 discovered island, found empty ivory
 casket,—the poor little indian’s skeleton.
 
wonder, then, nantucketers, born beach, should
 take livelihood! first caught crabs quohogs
 sand; grown bolder, waded nets mackerel; more
 experienced, pushed boats captured cod; last,
 launching navy great ships sea, explored watery world;
 put incessant belt circumnavigations round it; peeped at
 behring’s straits; seasons oceans declared
 everlasting war mightiest animated mass survived the
 flood; monstrous mountainous! himmalehan, salt-sea
 mastodon, clothed portentousness unconscious power, that
 panics dreaded fearless and
 malicious assaults!
 
thus naked nantucketers, hermits, issuing from
 ant-hill sea, overrun conquered watery world like
 many alexanders; parcelling among atlantic, pacific,
 indian oceans, three pirate powers poland. let america

quite late evening little moss came snugly to

 mrs. hussey entirely competent attend affairs. upon
 making known desires supper bed, mrs. hussey,
 postponing scolding present, ushered us little

“what’s cods, ma’am?” said i, much politeness.
 
“clam cod?” repeated.
 
“a clam supper? cold clam; _that_ mean, mrs. hussey?”
 says i, “but that’s rather cold clammy reception winter

great hurry resume scolding man purple

“queequeg,” said i, “do think can make supper us

however, warm savory steam kitchen served belie the
 apparently cheerless prospect us. smoking chowder

going forward glancing weather bow, perceived the
 ship swinging anchor flood-tide, now obliquely
 pointing towards open ocean. prospect unlimited, but
 exceedingly monotonous forbidding; slightest variety i

“well, what’s report?” said peleg came back; “what ye

“not much,” replied—“nothing water; considerable horizon though,
 there’s squall coming up, think.”
 
“well, thou think seeing world? ye wish go

“and thou mayest well sign papers right off,” added—“come

like captain peleg, captain bildad well-to-do, retired whaleman.
 unlike captain peleg—who cared rush called

 conscientious scruples, bear arms land invaders, yet himself

 before, concluded adventurous career wholly retiring from

 days quiet receiving well-earned income.
 
now, bildad, sorry say, reputation an
 incorrigible old hunks, sea-going days, bitter, hard
 task-master. told nantucket, though certainly seems a
 curious story, sailed old categut whaleman, crew,
 upon arriving home, mostly carried ashore hospital,

such, then, person saw seated transom i
 followed captain peleg cabin. space decks
 small; there, bolt-upright, sat old bildad, always sat so,
 never leaned, save coat tails. broad-brim was
 placed beside him; legs stiffly crossed; drab vesture was
 buttoned chin; spectacles nose, seemed absorbed in
 reading ponderous volume.
 
“bildad,” cried captain peleg, “at again, bildad, eh? ye been
 studying scriptures, now, last thirty years, my
 certain knowledge. far ye got, bildad?”
 
long habituated profane talk old shipmate,
 bildad, without noticing present irreverence, quietly looked up,
 seeing me, glanced inquiringly towards peleg.
 
“he says he’s man, bildad,” said peleg, “he wants ship.”
 
“dost thee?” said bildad, hollow tone, turning round me.
 
“i _dost_,” said unconsciously, intense quaker.
 
“what ye think him, bildad?” said peleg.
 
“he’ll do,” said bildad, eyeing me, went spelling away at
 book mumbling tone quite audible.
 
thought queerest old quaker ever saw, especially peleg,
 friend old shipmate, seemed blusterer. said
 nothing, looking round sharply. peleg now threw open chest,
 drawing forth ship’s articles, placed pen ink him,
 seated little table. began think high time

 whatever might eventually amount to. though 275th lay was

 grim sign thunder cloud. upon whole, thought the
 275th lay fair thing, been
 surprised offered 200th, considering a
 broad-shouldered make.
 
one thing, nevertheless, made little distrustful about
 receiving generous share profits this: ashore, heard
 something captain peleg unaccountable old crony bildad;
 principal proprietors pequod, therefore
 inconsiderable scattered owners, left nearly the
 whole management ship’s affairs two. know
 stingy old bildad might mighty deal say about
 shipping hands, especially now found board pequod,
 quite home cabin, reading bible his
 fireside. now peleg vainly trying mend pen his
 jack-knife, old bildad, small surprise, considering he
 interested party proceedings; bildad never heeded
 us, went mumbling book, “_lay_ for
 treasures upon earth, moth—”
 
“well, captain bildad,” interrupted peleg, “what d’ye say, lay
 shall give young man?”
 
“thou knowest best,” sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and
 seventy-seventh wouldn’t much, it?—‘where moth rust do
 corrupt, _lay_—’”
 
_lay_, indeed, thought i, lay! seven hundred and
 seventy-seventh! well, old bildad, determined i, one,
 shall _lay_ many _lays_ below, moth rust do
 corrupt. exceedingly _long lay_ that, indeed; though from
 magnitude figure might first deceive landsman, yet
 slightest consideration will show though seven hundred and
 seventy-seven pretty large number, yet, come make a

 seventy-seventh part farthing good deal less seven
 hundred seventy-seven gold doubloons; thought time.
 
“why, blast eyes, bildad,” cried peleg, “thou dost want to
 swindle young man! must that.”
 
“seven hundred seventy-seventh,” said bildad, without lifting
 eyes; went mumbling—“for treasure is, there
 will heart also.”
 
“i going put three hundredth,” said peleg, “do
 ye hear that, bildad! three hundredth lay, say.”
 
bildad laid book, turning solemnly towards said,
 “captain peleg, thou hast generous heart; thou must consider the

 many them—and abundantly reward labors this
 young man, may taking bread widows those

“thou bildad!” roared peleg, starting clattering the
 cabin. “blast ye, captain bildad, followed thy advice these
 matters, afore now conscience lug be

“captain peleg,” said bildad steadily, “thy conscience may drawing

“fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past natural bearing, ye

 responsible owners ship, feeling half mind give all

 made doubt, eagerness vanish awakened

 transom quietly, seemed slightest intention of

 peleg, letting rage had, seemed more

“captain peleg,” said i, “i friend wants ship

“to sure,” said peleg. “fetch along, we’ll look him.”
 
“what lay want?” groaned bildad, glancing book in
 burying himself.
 
“oh! never thee mind that, bildad,” said peleg. “has ever

“killed whales can count, captain peleg.”
 
“well, bring along then.”

 indeed, many cases, whale-ship will completely fitted out, and

 arriving take command; sometimes voyages prolonged,
 shore intervals home exceedingly brief, the
 captain family, absorbing concernment sort, he
 trouble much ship port, leaves to
 owners till ready sea. however, always well to
 look irrevocably committing his
 hands. turning back accosted captain peleg, inquiring captain
 ahab found.
 
“and dost thou want captain ahab? it’s right enough; thou
 art shipped.”
 
“yes, like see him.”
 
“but don’t think thou wilt able present. don’t know
 exactly what’s matter him; keeps close inside the
 house; sort sick, yet don’t look so. fact, ain’t
 sick; no, isn’t well either. how, young man, won’t always
 see me, don’t suppose will thee. he’s queer man, captain
 ahab—so think—but good one. oh, thou’lt like well enough; no
 fear, fear. he’s grand, ungodly, god-like man, captain ahab;
 doesn’t speak much; but, speak, may well listen.
 mark ye, forewarned; ahab’s common; ahab’s in
 colleges, well ’mong cannibals; used deeper wonders

 _he’s ahab_, boy; ahab old, thou knowest, crowned king!”
 
“and vile one. wicked king slain, dogs, did
 lick blood?”
 
“come hither me—hither, hither,” said peleg, significance in
 eye almost startled me. “look ye, lad; never say board
 pequod. never say anywhere. captain ahab name himself.
 ’twas foolish, ignorant whim crazy, widowed mother, died

 perhaps, fools like may tell thee same. wish warn

walked away, full thoughtfulness; been
 incidentally revealed captain ahab, filled certain
 wild vagueness painfulness concerning him. somehow, time,
 felt sympathy sorrow him, don’t know what,
 unless cruel loss leg. yet also felt strange

“queequeg!—queequeg!”—all still. something must happened.
 apoplexy! tried burst open door; stubbornly resisted.

mrs. hussey soon appeared, mustard-pot one hand a

“wood-house!” cried i, “which way it? run god’s sake, fetch

“what’s matter you, young man?”
 
“get axe! god’s sake, run doctor, one, pry

“look here,” said landlady, quickly putting vinegar-cruet,

calm, rapid manner possible, gave understand

chapter 18. mark.
 
walking end wharf towards ship, queequeg
 carrying harpoon, captain peleg gruff voice loudly hailed us
 wigwam, saying suspected friend cannibal,
 furthermore announcing let cannibals board that
 craft, unless previously produced papers.
 
“what mean that, captain peleg?” said i, now jumping the
 bulwarks, leaving comrade standing wharf.
 
“i mean,” replied, “he must show papers.”
 
“yes,” said captain bildad hollow voice, sticking head from
 behind peleg’s, wigwam. “he must show he’s converted.
 darkness,” added, turning queequeg, “art thou present
 communion christian church?”
 
“why,” said i, “he’s member first congregational church.” here
 said, many tattooed savages sailing nantucket ships at
 last come converted churches.
 
“first congregational church,” cried bildad, “what! worships in
 deacon deuteronomy coleman’s meeting-house?” saying, taking out
 spectacles, rubbed great yellow bandana
 handkerchief, putting carefully, came the
 wigwam, leaning stiffly bulwarks, took good long look at
 queequeg.
 
“how long hath member?” said, turning me; “not
 long, rather guess, young man.”
 
“no,” said peleg, “and hasn’t baptized right either, it
 washed devil’s blue face.”
 
“do tell, now,” cried bildad, “is philistine regular member of
 deacon deuteronomy’s meeting? never saw going there, pass
 every lord’s day.”
 
“i don’t know anything deacon deuteronomy meeting,” said
 i; “all know is, queequeg born member first
 congregational church. deacon himself, queequeg is.”
 
“young man,” said bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking me—explain
 thyself, thou young hittite. church dost thee mean? answer me.”
 
finding thus hard pushed, replied. “i mean, sir, same
 ancient catholic church i, captain peleg there,
 queequeg here, us, every mother’s soul us
 belong; great everlasting first congregation whole
 worshipping world; belong that; us cherish some
 queer crotchets ways touching grand belief; _that_ all
 join hands.”
 
“splice, thou mean’st _splice_ hands,” cried peleg, drawing nearer.
 “young man, you’d better ship missionary, instead fore-mast
 hand; never heard better sermon. deacon deuteronomy—why father
 mapple couldn’t beat it, he’s reckoned something. come
 aboard, come aboard; never mind papers. say, tell quohog
 there—what’s call him? tell quohog step along. great
 anchor, harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and
 handles right. say, quohog, whatever name is, did
 ever stand head whale-boat? ever strike a
 fish?”
 
without saying word, queequeg, wild sort way, jumped upon
 bulwarks, thence bows one whale-boats
 hanging side; bracing left knee, poising his
 harpoon, cried way this:—
 
“cap’ain, see small drop tar water dere? see him? well,
 spose one whale eye, well, den!” taking sharp aim it, he
 darted iron right old bildad’s broad brim, clean across the
 ship’s decks, struck glistening tar spot sight.
 
“now,” said queequeg, quietly hauling line, “spos-ee whale-e
 eye; why, dad whale dead.”
 
“quick, bildad,” said peleg, partner, who, aghast close
 vicinity flying harpoon, retreated towards cabin
 gangway. “quick, say, bildad, get ship’s papers. must
 hedgehog there, mean quohog, one boats. look ye,
 quohog, we’ll give ye ninetieth lay, that’s ever was
 given harpooneer yet nantucket.”
 
went cabin, great joy queequeg soon
 enrolled among ship’s company belonged.
 
preliminaries peleg got everything ready for
 signing, turned said, “i guess, quohog don’t know
 write, he? say, quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name
 make thy mark?”
 
question, queequeg, twice thrice taken
 part similar ceremonies, looked ways abashed; taking the
 offered pen, copied upon paper, proper place, exact
 counterpart queer round figure tattooed upon arm; so
 captain peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his
 appellative, stood something like this:—
 
quohog. x mark.
 
meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly steadfastly eyeing queequeg,
 last rising solemnly fumbling huge pockets his
 broad-skirted drab coat, took bundle tracts, selecting one
 entitled “the latter day coming; time lose,” placed in
 queequeg’s hands, grasping book his,
 looked earnestly eyes, said, “son darkness, must do
 duty thee; part owner ship, feel concerned for
 souls crew; thou still clingest thy pagan ways,
 sadly fear, beseech thee, remain aye belial
 bondsman. spurn idol bell, hideous dragon; turn the
 wrath come; mind thine eye, say; oh! goodness gracious! steer
 clear fiery pit!”
 
something salt yet lingered old bildad’s language,
 heterogeneously mixed scriptural domestic phrases.
 
“avast there, avast there, bildad, avast now spoiling harpooneer,”
 cried peleg. “pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the
 shark ’em; harpooneer worth straw aint pretty
 sharkish. young nat swaine, bravest boat-header out
 nantucket vineyard; joined meeting, never
 came good. got frightened plaguy soul, he
 shrinked sheered away whales, fear after-claps, case
 got stove went davy jones.”
 
“peleg! peleg!” said bildad, lifting eyes hands, “thou thyself,
 myself, hast seen many perilous time; thou knowest, peleg, what
 fear death; how, then, can’st thou prate this
 ungodly guise. thou beliest thine heart, peleg. tell me, this
 pequod three masts overboard typhoon on
 japan, voyage thou went mate captain ahab, did’st
 thou think death judgment then?”
 
“hear him, hear now,” cried peleg, marching across cabin, and
 thrusting hands far pockets,—“hear him, ye.
 think that! every moment thought ship sink! death
 judgment then? what? three masts making an
 everlasting thundering side; every breaking over
 us, fore aft. think death judgment then? no! time to
 think death then. life captain ahab thinking
 of; save hands—how rig jury-masts—how get the
 nearest port; thinking of.”
 
bildad said more, buttoning coat, stalked deck, where
 followed him. stood, quietly overlooking some
 sailmakers mending top-sail waist. now he
 stooped pick patch, save end tarred twine, which
 otherwise might wasted.

“shipmates, ye shipped ship?”
 
queequeg just left pequod, sauntering away from

 levelled massive forefinger vessel question. but
 shabbily apparelled faded jacket patched trowsers; rag a

“have ye shipped her?” repeated.
 
“you mean ship pequod, suppose,” said i, trying gain little

“aye, pequod—that ship there,” said, drawing back whole arm,
 rapidly shoving straight him, fixed
 bayonet pointed finger darted full object.
 
“yes,” said i, “we just signed articles.”
 
“anything souls?”
 
“about what?”
 
“oh, perhaps hav’n’t got any,” said quickly. “no matter though,
 know many chaps hav’n’t got any,—good luck ’em; are
 better it. soul’s sort fifth wheel a

“what jabbering about, shipmate?” said i.
 
“_he’s_ got enough, though, make deficiencies that
 sort chaps,” abruptly said stranger, placing nervous
 emphasis upon word _he_.
 
“queequeg,” said i, “let’s go; fellow broken loose from
 somewhere; he’s talking something somebody don’t know.”
 
“stop!” cried stranger. “ye said true—ye hav’n’t seen old thunder
 yet, ye?”
 
“who’s old thunder?” said i, riveted insane earnestness
 manner.
 
“captain ahab.”
 
“what! captain ship, pequod?”
 
“aye, among us old sailor chaps, goes name. ye
 hav’n’t seen yet, ye?”
 
“no, hav’n’t. he’s sick say, getting better, will be
 right long.”
 
“all right long!” laughed stranger, solemnly
 derisive sort laugh. “look ye; captain ahab right, then
 left arm mine will right; before.”
 
“what know him?”
 
“what _tell_ him? say that!”
 
“they didn’t tell much anything him; i’ve heard he’s
 good whale-hunter, good captain crew.”
 
“that’s true, that’s true—yes, true enough. must jump when
 gives order. step growl; growl go—that’s word with
 captain ahab. nothing thing happened off
 cape horn, long ago, lay like dead three days nights;
 nothing deadly skrimmage spaniard afore altar

 calabash spat into? nothing losing leg last
 voyage, according prophecy. didn’t ye hear word them
 matters something more, eh? no, don’t think ye did; ye?
 knows it? nantucket, guess. hows’ever, mayhap, ye’ve
 heard tell leg, lost it; aye, ye heard of
 that, dare say. oh yes, _that_ every one knows a’most—i mean they
 know he’s one leg; parmacetti took off.”
 
“my friend,” said i, “what gibberish about, i
 don’t know, don’t much care; seems must be

 ship there, pequod, let tell you, know all

“_all_ it, eh—sure do?—all?”
 
“pretty sure.”
 
finger pointed eye levelled pequod, beggar-like
 stranger stood moment, troubled reverie; starting a
 little, turned said:—“ye’ve shipped, ye? names the
 papers? well, well, what’s signed, signed; what’s be, will
 be; again, perhaps won’t be, all. anyhow, it’s all
 fixed arranged a’ready; sailors must go him,
 suppose; well men, god pity ’em! morning ye,
 shipmates, morning; ineffable heavens bless ye; i’m sorry stopped

“look here, friend,” said i, “if anything important tell
 us, it; trying bamboozle us, are
 mistaken game; that’s say.”
 
“and it’s said well, like hear chap talk way;
 just man him—the likes ye. morning ye, shipmates,

“ah, dear fellow, can’t fool us way—you can’t fool us. it

“morning ye, shipmates, morning.”
 
“morning is,” said i. “come along, queequeg, let’s leave crazy
 man. stop, tell name, will you?”
 
“elijah.”
 
elijah! thought i, walked away, commenting, each
 other’s fashion, upon ragged old sailor; agreed was
 nothing humbug, trying bugbear. gone
 perhaps hundred yards, chancing turn corner, and
 looking back so, seen elijah following us,
 though distance. somehow, sight struck so, i
 said nothing queequeg behind, passed my
 comrade, anxious see whether stranger turn corner

 circumstance, coupled ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,
 shrouded sort talk, now begat kinds vague wonderments
 half-apprehensions, connected pequod; captain
 ahab; leg lost; cape horn fit; silver

resolved satisfy whether ragged elijah really

 without seeming notice us. relieved me; more, and
 finally seemed me, pronounced heart, humbug.
 

chapter 20. astir.
 
day two passed, great activity aboard pequod.
 old sails mended, new sails coming on
 board, bolts canvas, coils rigging; short, everything
 betokened ship’s preparations hurrying close.
 captain peleg seldom never went ashore, sat wigwam
 keeping sharp look-out upon hands: bildad purchasing
 providing stores; men employed hold on
 rigging working till long night-fall.
 
day following queequeg’s signing articles, word given at
 inns ship’s company stopping, chests
 must board night, telling soon the
 vessel might sailing. queequeg got traps,
 resolving, however, sleep ashore till last. seems they
 always give long notice cases, ship sail
 several days. wonder; good deal done, and
 telling many things thought of, pequod
 fully equipped.
 
every one knows multitude things—beds, sauce-pans, knives and
 forks, shovels tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, not, are
 indispensable business housekeeping. just whaling,
 necessitates three-years’ housekeeping upon wide ocean, far
 grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, bankers. and
 though also holds true merchant vessels, yet means
 extent whalemen. besides great length of
 whaling voyage, numerous articles peculiar prosecution
 fishery, impossibility replacing remote
 harbors usually frequented, must remembered, ships,
 whaling vessels exposed accidents kinds, and
 especially destruction loss things upon which
 success voyage depends. hence, spare boats, spare
 spars, spare lines harpoons, spare everythings, almost, but
 spare captain duplicate ship.
 
period arrival island, heaviest storage the
 pequod almost completed; comprising beef, bread, water,
 fuel, iron hoops staves. but, hinted, time
 continual fetching carrying board divers odds and
 ends things, large small.
 
chief among fetching carrying captain
 bildad’s sister, lean old lady determined indefatigable
 spirit, withal kindhearted, seemed resolved that, _she_
 help it, nothing found wanting pequod, after
 fairly getting sea. one time come board a
 jar pickles steward’s pantry; another time bunch of
 quills chief mate’s desk, kept log; third time
 roll flannel small one’s rheumatic back.
 never woman better deserve name, charity—aunt
 charity, everybody called her. like sister charity this
 charitable aunt charity bustle hither thither, ready turn
 hand heart anything promised yield safety, comfort,
 consolation board ship beloved brother
 bildad concerned, owned score two of
 well-saved dollars.
 
startling see excellent hearted quakeress coming on
 board, last day, long oil-ladle one hand, and
 still longer whaling lance other. bildad nor
 captain peleg backward. bildad, carried him
 long list articles needed, every fresh arrival, down
 went mark opposite article upon paper. every a
 peleg came hobbling whalebone den, roaring men
 hatchways, roaring riggers mast-head, and
 concluded roaring back wigwam.
 
days preparation, queequeg often visited the
 craft, often asked captain ahab, was, and
 going come board ship. questions they
 answer, getting better better, expected
 aboard every day; meantime, two captains, peleg bildad, could
 attend everything necessary fit vessel voyage. i
 downright honest myself, seen plainly
 heart half fancy committed way so
 long voyage, without laying eyes man the
 absolute dictator it, soon ship sailed upon open
 sea. man suspects wrong, sometimes happens he
 already involved matter, insensibly strives cover up
 suspicions even himself. much way me. i
 said nothing, tried think nothing.
 
last given time next day ship would
 certainly sail. next morning, queequeg took early
 start.
 

chapter 21. going aboard.
 
nearly six o’clock, grey imperfect misty dawn, we
 drew nigh wharf.
 
“there sailors running ahead there, see right,” said to
 queequeg, “it can’t shadows; she’s sunrise, guess; come
 on!”
 
“avast!” cried voice, whose owner time coming close
 behind us, laid hand upon shoulders, insinuating
 us, stood stooping forward little, uncertain
 twilight, strangely peering queequeg me. elijah.
 
“going aboard?”
 
“hands off, will you,” said i.
 
“lookee here,” said queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”
 
“ain’t going aboard, then?”
 
“yes, are,” said i, “but business yours? you
 know, mr. elijah, consider little impertinent?”
 
“no, no, no; wasn’t aware that,” said elijah, slowly and
 wonderingly looking queequeg, unaccountable
 glances.
 
“elijah,” said i, “you will oblige friend withdrawing. we
 going indian pacific oceans, prefer be
 detained.”
 
“ye be, ye? coming back afore breakfast?”
 
“he’s cracked, queequeg,” said i, “come on.”
 
“holloa!” cried stationary elijah, hailing us removed few
 paces.
 
“never mind him,” said i, “queequeg, come on.”
 
stole us again, suddenly clapping hand my
 shoulder, said—“did ye see anything looking like men going towards that
 ship ago?”
 
struck plain matter-of-fact question, answered, saying, “yes,
 thought see four five men; dim sure.”
 
“very dim, dim,” said elijah. “morning ye.”
 
quitted him; came softly us; and
 touching shoulder again, said, “see can find ’em now, will
 ye?
 
“find who?”
 
“morning ye! morning ye!” rejoined, moving off. “oh! i
 going warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—it’s one,
 family too;—sharp frost morning, ain’t it? good-bye to
 ye. shan’t see ye soon, guess; unless it’s the
 grand jury.” cracked words finally departed, leaving
 me, moment, small wonderment frantic impudence.
 
last, stepping board pequod, found everything profound
 quiet, soul moving. cabin entrance locked within; the
 hatches on, lumbered coils rigging. going forward
 forecastle, found slide scuttle open. seeing a
 light, went down, found old rigger there, wrapped a
 tattered pea-jacket. thrown whole length upon two chests, his
 face downwards inclosed folded arms. profoundest slumber
 slept upon him.
 
“those sailors saw, queequeg, can gone to?” said i,
 looking dubiously sleeper. seemed that, the
 wharf, queequeg noticed now alluded to; hence i
 thought optically deceived that
 matter, elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question. i
 beat thing down; marking sleeper, jocularly hinted to
 queequeg perhaps best sit body; telling to
 establish accordingly. put hand upon sleeper’s rear,
 though feeling soft enough; then, without ado,
 sat quietly there.
 
“gracious! queequeg, don’t sit there,” said i.
 
“oh! perry dood seat,” said queequeg, “my country way; won’t hurt him
 face.”
 
“face!” said i, “call face? benevolent countenance then;
 hard breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, queequeg, you
 heavy, it’s grinding face poor. get off, queequeg! look,
 he’ll twitch soon. wonder don’t wake.”
 
queequeg removed just beyond head sleeper, and
 lighted tomahawk pipe. sat feet. kept pipe passing
 sleeper, one other. meanwhile, upon questioning
 broken fashion, queequeg gave understand that, his
 land, owing absence settees sofas sorts, king,
 chiefs, great people generally, custom fattening
 lower orders ottomans; furnish house
 comfortably respect, buy eight ten lazy
 fellows, lay round piers alcoves. besides, was
 convenient excursion; much better garden-chairs
 convertible walking-sticks; upon occasion, chief
 calling attendant, desiring make settee himself
 spreading tree, perhaps damp marshy place.
 
narrating things, every time queequeg received tomahawk
 me, flourished hatchet-side sleeper’s head.
 
“what’s for, queequeg?”
 
“perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”
 
going wild reminiscences tomahawk-pipe,
 which, seemed, two uses brained foes soothed
 soul, directly attracted sleeping rigger. the
 strong vapor now completely filling contracted hole, began to
 tell upon him. breathed sort muffledness; seemed
 troubled nose; revolved twice; sat and
 rubbed eyes.
 
“holloa!” breathed last, “who ye smokers?”
 
“shipped men,” answered i, “when sail?”
 
“aye, aye, ye going her, ye? sails to-day. captain
 came aboard last night.”
 
“what captain?—ahab?”
 
“who indeed?”
 
going ask questions concerning ahab, we
 heard noise deck.
 
“holloa! starbuck’s astir,” said rigger. “he’s lively chief mate,
 that; good man, pious; alive now, must turn to.” so
 saying went deck, followed.
 
now clear sunrise. soon crew came board twos and
 threes; riggers bestirred themselves; mates actively
 engaged; several shore people busy bringing various
 last things board. meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly
 enshrined within cabin.
 

chapter 22. merry christmas.
 
length, towards noon, upon final dismissal ship’s
 riggers, pequod hauled wharf, and
 ever-thoughtful charity come whale-boat, with
 last gift—a night-cap stubb, second mate, her
 brother-in-law, spare bible steward—after this, the
 two captains, peleg bildad, issued cabin, turning to
 chief mate, peleg said:
 
“now, mr. starbuck, sure everything right? captain ahab is
 ready—just spoke him—nothing got shore, eh?
 well, call hands, then. muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”
 
“no need profane words, however great hurry, peleg,” said
 bildad, “but away thee, friend starbuck, bidding.”
 
now! upon point starting voyage, captain
 peleg captain bildad going high hand the
 quarter-deck, just joint-commanders sea, as
 well appearances port. and, captain ahab, sign
 yet seen; only, said cabin. but
 then, idea was, presence means necessary in
 getting ship weigh, steering well sea. indeed,
 proper business, pilot’s; he
 yet completely recovered—so said—therefore, captain ahab
 stayed below. seemed natural enough; especially the
 merchant service many captains never show deck a
 considerable time heaving anchor, remain the
 cabin table, farewell merry-making shore friends,
 quit ship good pilot.
 
much chance think matter, captain
 peleg now alive. seemed talking and
 commanding, bildad.
 
“aft here, ye sons bachelors,” cried, sailors lingered at
 main-mast. “mr. starbuck, drive ’em aft.”
 
“strike tent there!”—was next order. hinted before, this
 whalebone marquee never pitched except port; board the
 pequod, thirty years, order strike tent well known
 next thing heaving anchor.
 
“man capstan! blood thunder!—jump!”—was next command, and
 crew sprang handspikes.
 
now getting weigh, station generally occupied pilot
 forward part ship. bildad, who, peleg, be
 known, addition officers, one licensed
 pilots port—he suspected got made pilot
 order save nantucket pilot-fee ships was
 concerned in, never piloted craft—bildad, say, might
 now seen actively engaged looking bows the
 approaching anchor, intervals singing seemed dismal stave
 psalmody, cheer hands windlass, roared forth some
 sort chorus girls booble alley, hearty good
 will. nevertheless, three days previous, bildad told that
 profane songs allowed board pequod, particularly in
 getting weigh; charity, sister, placed small choice
 copy watts seaman’s berth.
 
meantime, overseeing part ship, captain peleg ripped
 swore astern frightful manner. almost thought he
 sink ship anchor got up; involuntarily i
 paused handspike, told queequeg same, thinking of
 perils ran, starting voyage devil for
 pilot. comforting myself, however, thought in
 pious bildad might found salvation, spite seven hundred
 seventy-seventh lay; felt sudden sharp poke rear,
 turning round, horrified apparition captain peleg in
 act withdrawing leg immediate vicinity. my
 first kick.
 
“is way heave marchant service?” roared.
 “spring, thou sheep-head; spring, break thy backbone! don’t ye
 spring, say, ye—spring! quohog! spring, thou chap red
 whiskers; spring there, scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. spring, i
 say, ye, spring eyes out!” saying, moved
 along windlass, using leg freely, while
 imperturbable bildad kept leading psalmody. thinks i,
 captain peleg must drinking something to-day.
 
last anchor up, sails set, glided. it
 short, cold christmas; short northern day merged into
 night, found almost broad upon wintry ocean, whose
 freezing spray cased us ice, polished armor. long rows of
 teeth bulwarks glistened moonlight; like white
 ivory tusks huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from
 bows.
 
lank bildad, pilot, headed first watch, ever anon, as
 old craft deep dived green seas, sent shivering
 frost her, winds howled, cordage rang, his
 steady notes heard,—
 

_“sweet fields beyond swelling flood, stand dressed living
 green. jews old canaan stood, jordan rolled between.”_
 


never sweet words sound sweetly then. they
 full hope fruition. spite frigid winter night in
 boisterous atlantic, spite wet feet wetter jacket, there
 yet, seemed me, many pleasant haven store; and
 meads glades eternally vernal, grass shot the
 spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains midsummer.
 
last gained offing, two pilots needed no
 longer. stout sail-boat accompanied us began ranging
 alongside.
 
curious unpleasing, peleg bildad affected
 juncture, especially captain bildad. loath depart, yet;
 loath leave, good, ship bound long perilous a
 voyage—beyond stormy capes; ship thousands his
 hard earned dollars invested; ship, old shipmate
 sailed captain; man almost old he, starting to
 encounter terrors pitiless jaw; loath say good-bye to
 thing every way brimful every interest him,—poor old bildad
 lingered long; paced deck anxious strides; ran the
 cabin speak another farewell word there; came deck, and
 looked windward; looked towards wide endless waters, only
 bounded far-off unseen eastern continents; looked towards the
 land; looked aloft; looked right left; looked everywhere and
 nowhere; last, mechanically coiling rope upon pin,
 convulsively grasped stout peleg hand, holding lantern,
 moment stood gazing heroically face, much say,
 “nevertheless, friend peleg, can stand it; yes, can.”
 
peleg himself, took like philosopher; all
 philosophy, tear twinkling eye, lantern
 came near. he, too, little run cabin deck—now
 word below, now word starbuck, chief mate.
 
but, last, turned comrade, final sort look about
 him,—“captain bildad—come, old shipmate, must go. back main-yard
 there! boat ahoy! stand come close alongside, now! careful,
 careful!—come, bildad, boy—say last. luck ye, starbuck—luck to
 ye, mr. stubb—luck ye, mr. flask—good-bye good luck ye
 all—and day three years i’ll hot supper smoking ye in
 old nantucket. hurrah away!”
 
“god bless ye, ye holy keeping, men,” murmured old
 bildad, almost incoherently. “i hope ye’ll fine weather now, so
 captain ahab may soon moving among ye—a pleasant sun he
 needs, ye’ll plenty tropic voyage ye go. be

 don’t miss fair chance either, that’s rejecting heaven’s good gifts.

 thought. ye touch islands, mr. flask, beware fornication.
 good-bye, good-bye! don’t keep cheese long hold,
 mr. starbuck; it’ll spoil. careful butter—twenty cents the
 pound was, mind ye, if—”
 
“come, come, captain bildad; stop palavering,—away!” that,

 ere long see word “careful” precisely means used a
 man like stubb, almost whale hunter.
 
starbuck crusader perils; courage a

 terrible experiences remembrances had; nature
 things fail latently engendering element in

 turned in, smoked succession, lighting one from

 legs trowsers, put pipe mouth.
 
say continual smoking must one cause, least, his
 peculiar disposition; every one knows earthly air,

chapter 28. ahab.
 
several days leaving nantucket, nothing hatches was
 seen captain ahab. mates regularly relieved the
 watches, aught seen contrary, seemed
 commanders ship; sometimes issued from
 cabin orders sudden peremptory, was
 plain commanded vicariously. yes, supreme lord and
 dictator there, though hitherto unseen eyes permitted to
 penetrate now sacred retreat cabin.
 
every time ascended deck watches below, instantly
 gazed aft mark strange face visible; first vague
 disquietude touching unknown captain, now seclusion the
 sea, became almost perturbation. strangely heightened at
 times ragged elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
 recurring me, subtle energy conceived
 of. poorly withstand them, much moods was
 almost ready smile solemn whimsicalities outlandish
 prophet wharves. whatever apprehensiveness or
 uneasiness—to call so—which felt, yet whenever came look
 ship, seemed warrantry cherish such
 emotions. though harpooneers, great body crew,
 far barbaric, heathenish, motley set the
 tame merchant-ship companies previous experiences made me
 acquainted with, still ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to the
 fierce uniqueness nature wild scandinavian vocation
 abandonedly embarked. especially the
 aspect three chief officers ship, mates, was
 forcibly calculated allay colourless misgivings, and
 induce confidence cheerfulness every presentment voyage.
 three better, likely sea-officers men, own
 different way, readily found, every one of
 americans; nantucketer, vineyarder, cape man. now, being
 christmas ship shot harbor, space had
 biting polar weather, though time running away the
 southward; every degree minute latitude sailed,
 gradually leaving merciless winter, intolerable
 weather behind us. one less lowering, still grey
 gloomy enough mornings transition, fair wind the
 ship rushing water vindictive sort leaping
 melancholy rapidity, mounted deck call of
 forenoon watch, soon levelled glance towards the
 taffrail, foreboding shivers ran me. reality outran apprehension;
 captain ahab stood upon quarter-deck.
 
seemed sign common bodily illness him, the
 recovery any. looked like man cut away stake, when
 fire overrunningly wasted limbs without consuming them,
 taking away one particle compacted aged robustness. his
 whole high, broad form, seemed made solid bronze, shaped an
 unalterable mould, like cellini’s cast perseus. threading way out
 among grey hairs, continuing right one side his
 tawny scorched face neck, till disappeared clothing, you
 saw slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. resembled that
 perpendicular seam sometimes made straight, lofty trunk a
 great tree, upper lightning tearingly darts it, and
 without wrenching single twig, peels grooves bark from
 top bottom, ere running soil, leaving tree still
 greenly alive, branded. whether mark born him, or
 whether scar left desperate wound, one could
 certainly say. tacit consent, throughout voyage little or
 allusion made it, especially mates. once
 tashtego’s senior, old gay-head indian among crew,
 superstitiously asserted till full forty years old did
 ahab become way branded, came upon him, the
 fury mortal fray, elemental strife sea. yet, this
 wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, grey manxman
 insinuated, old sepulchral man, who, never sailed out
 nantucket, never ere laid eye upon wild ahab. nevertheless,
 old sea-traditions, immemorial credulities, popularly invested
 old manxman preternatural powers discernment. no
 white sailor seriously contradicted said ever
 captain ahab tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to
 pass, muttered—then, whoever last office the
 dead, find birth-mark crown sole.
 
powerfully whole grim aspect ahab affect me, the
 livid brand streaked it, first moments hardly
 noted little overbearing grimness owing the
 barbaric white leg upon partly stood. previously come
 ivory leg fashioned polished

 old gay-head indian once; “but like dismasted craft, shipped

struck singular posture maintained. upon side of
 pequod’s quarter deck, pretty close mizzen shrouds,
 auger hole, bored half inch so, the
 plank. bone leg steadied hole; one arm elevated, and
 holding shroud; captain ahab stood erect, looking straight out
 beyond ship’s ever-pitching prow. infinity firmest
 fortitude, determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, fixed and
 fearless, forward dedication glance. word spoke; nor
 officers say aught him; though minutest
 gestures expressions, plainly showed uneasy, not
 painful, consciousness troubled master-eye. not
 that, moody stricken ahab stood crucifixion
 face; nameless regal overbearing dignity some
 mighty woe.
 
ere long, first visit air, withdrew cabin.
 morning, every day visible crew; either
 standing pivot-hole, seated upon ivory stool had; or
 heavily walking deck. sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to
 grow little genial, became still less less recluse; if,
 ship sailed home, nothing dead wintry
 bleakness kept secluded. and, by, it
 came pass, almost continually air; but, yet,
 said, perceptibly did, last sunny deck, he
 seemed unnecessary another mast. pequod only
 making passage now; regularly cruising; nearly whaling
 preparatives needing supervision mates fully competent to, so
 little nothing, himself, employ excite
 ahab, now; thus chase away, one interval, clouds that
 layer upon layer piled upon brow, ever clouds choose
 loftiest peaks pile upon.
 
nevertheless, ere long, warm, warbling persuasiveness the
 pleasant, holiday weather came to, seemed gradually charm him
 mood. for, red-cheeked, dancing girls, april and
 may, trip home wintry, misanthropic woods; even barest,
 ruggedest, thunder-cloven old oak will least send forth some
 green sprouts, welcome glad-hearted visitants; ahab did,
 end, little respond playful allurings girlish
 air. put forth faint blossom look,
 which, man, soon flowered smile.
 

chapter 29. enter ahab; him, stubb.
 
days elapsed, ice icebergs astern, pequod now went
 rolling bright quito spring, which, sea, almost
 perpetually reigns threshold eternal august the
 tropic. warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,
 redundant days, crystal goblets persian sherbet, heaped
 up—flaked up, rose-water snow. starred stately nights
 seemed haughty dames jewelled velvets, nursing home lonely
 pride, memory absent conquering earls, golden helmeted
 suns! sleeping man, ’twas hard choose winsome days
 seducing nights. witcheries unwaning
 weather merely lend new spells potencies outward
 world. inward turned upon soul, especially still mild
 hours eve came on; then, memory shot crystals clear ice
 forms noiseless twilights. subtle agencies, more
 wrought ahab’s texture.
 
old age always wakeful; if, longer linked life, less
 man aught looks like death. among sea-commanders,
 old greybeards will oftenest leave berths visit the
 night-cloaked deck. ahab; now, late, he
 seemed much live open air, truly speaking, visits
 cabin, cabin planks. “it feels
 like going one’s tomb,”—he mutter himself—“for an
 old captain like descending narrow scuttle, go my
 grave-dug berth.”
 
so, almost every twenty-four hours, watches night were
 set, band deck sentinelled slumbers band below;
 rope hauled upon forecastle, sailors
 flung rudely down, day, cautiousness dropt
 place fear disturbing slumbering shipmates; when
 sort steady quietude begin prevail, habitually, the
 silent steersman watch cabin-scuttle; ere long old
 man emerge, gripping iron banister, help crippled
 way. considering touch humanity him; times like
 these, usually abstained patrolling quarter-deck; because
 wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches ivory
 heel, reverberating crack din bony
 step, dreams crunching teeth of
 sharks. once, mood deep common regardings;
 heavy, lumber-like pace measuring ship from
 taffrail mainmast, stubb, old second mate, came below,
 certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted if
 captain ahab pleased walk planks, then, one say
 nay; might way muffling noise; hinting
 something indistinctly hesitatingly globe tow, the
 insertion it, ivory heel. ah! stubb, thou didst know
 ahab then.
 
“am cannon-ball, stubb,” said ahab, “that thou wouldst wad that
 fashion? go thy ways; forgot. thy nightly grave;
 ye sleep shrouds, use ye filling one at
 last.—down, dog, kennel!”
 
starting unforseen concluding exclamation suddenly
 scornful old man, stubb speechless moment; said excitedly,
 “i used spoken way, sir; less half
 like it, sir.”
 
“avast! gritted ahab set teeth, violently moving away,
 avoid passionate temptation.
 
“no, sir; yet,” said stubb, emboldened, “i will tamely be
 called dog, sir.”
 
“then called ten times donkey, mule, ass, begone,
 i’ll clear world thee!”
 
said this, ahab advanced upon overbearing terrors
 aspect, stubb involuntarily retreated.
 
“i never served without giving hard blow it,”
 muttered stubb, found descending cabin-scuttle. “it’s
 queer. stop, stubb; somehow, now, don’t well know whether go

first: uncertain, unsettled condition science cetology

 fish.” knowledge, know year 1850,

grounds upon linnæus fain banished whales from

 whereas, fish lungless cold blooded.
 
next: shall define whale, obvious externals, as

 however contracted, definition result expanded
 meditation. walrus spouts much like whale, walrus a
 fish, amphibious. last term definition is
 still cogent, coupled first. almost one must have
 noticed fish familiar landsmen flat, a
 vertical, up-and-down tail. whereas, among spouting fish tail,
 though may similarly shaped, invariably assumes horizontal
 position.
 
definition whale is, means exclude
 leviathanic brotherhood creature hitherto identified
 whale best informed nantucketers; nor, other
 hand, link fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as

 must included ground-plan cetology. now, then, come the

first: according magnitude divide whales three primary
 books (subdivisible chapters), shall comprehend them
 all, small large.
 
i. folio whale; ii. octavo whale; iii. duodecimo whale.
 
type folio present _sperm whale_; octavo,
 _grampus_; duodecimo, _porpoise_.
 
folios. among include following chapters:—i. the
 _sperm whale_; ii. _right whale_; iii. _fin-back whale_; iv.
 _hump-backed whale_; v. _razor back whale_; vi. _sulphur
 bottom whale_.
 
book i. (_folio_), chapter i. (_sperm whale_).—this whale, among the
 english old vaguely known trumpa whale, physeter
 whale, anvil headed whale, present cachalot the
 french, pottsfich germans, macrocephalus the
 long words. is, without doubt, largest inhabitant globe;
 formidable whales encounter; majestic in
 aspect; lastly, far valuable commerce; the
 creature valuable substance, spermaceti, is
 obtained. peculiarities will, many places, enlarged
 upon. chiefly name now do. philologically
 considered, absurd. centuries ago, sperm whale was
 almost wholly unknown proper individuality, oil
 accidentally obtained stranded fish; days
 spermaceti, seem, popularly supposed derived a
 creature identical one known england greenland
 right whale. idea also, spermaceti was
 quickening humor greenland whale first syllable
 word literally expresses. times, also, spermaceti was
 exceedingly scarce, used light, ointment

 nowadays buy ounce rhubarb. when, opine, course of
 time, true nature spermaceti became known, original name was
 still retained dealers; doubt enhance value a
 notion strangely significant scarcity. appellation
 must last come bestowed upon whale this
 spermaceti really derived.
 
book i. (_folio_), chapter ii. (_right whale_).—in one respect is
 venerable leviathans, one first regularly
 hunted man. yields article commonly known whalebone or
 baleen; oil specially known “whale oil,” inferior article
 commerce. among fishermen, indiscriminately designated by
 following titles: whale; greenland whale; black
 whale; great whale; true whale; right whale. a
 deal obscurity concerning identity species thus
 multitudinously baptised. whale, include in
 second species folios? great mysticetus the
 english naturalists; greenland whale english whalemen; the
 baleine ordinaire french whalemen; growlands walfish the
 swedes. whale two centuries past been

 world, designated right whale cruising grounds.

 grand features; yet presented single
 determinate fact upon ground radical distinction. by
 endless subdivisions based upon inconclusive differences, that
 departments natural history become repellingly intricate.
 right whale will elsewhere treated length, with
 reference elucidating sperm whale.
 
book i. (_folio_), chapter iii. (_fin-back_).—under head reckon
 monster which, various names fin-back, tall-spout, and
 long-john, seen almost every commonly whale
 whose distant jet often descried passengers crossing the
 atlantic, new york packet-tracks. length attains, and
 baleen, fin-back resembles right whale, less
 portly girth, lighter colour, approaching olive. great
 lips present cable-like aspect, formed intertwisting, slanting
 folds large wrinkles. grand distinguishing feature, fin,

 surface. moderately calm, slightly marked with
 spherical ripples, gnomon-like stands casts shadows
 upon wrinkled surface, may well supposed watery
 circle surrounding somewhat resembles dial, style and
 wavy hour-lines graved it. ahaz-dial shadow often goes
 back. fin-back gregarious. seems whale-hater, some
 men man-haters. shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly
 rising surface remotest sullen waters; his
 straight single lofty jet rising like tall misanthropic spear
 upon barren plain; gifted wondrous power velocity in
 swimming, defy present pursuit man; leviathan seems
 banished unconquerable cain race, bearing mark
 style upon back. baleen mouth, the
 fin-back sometimes included right whale, among theoretic
 species denominated _whalebone whales_, is, whales baleen. of
 called whalebone whales, seem several
 varieties, which, however, little known. broad-nosed whales
 beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed
 whales rostrated whales, fishermen’s names sorts.
 
connection appellative “whalebone whales,” of
 great importance mention, however nomenclature may be
 convenient facilitating allusions kind whales, yet is
 vain attempt clear classification leviathan, founded
 upon either baleen, hump, fin, teeth; notwithstanding that
 marked parts features obviously seem better adapted to
 afford basis regular system cetology other
 detached bodily distinctions, whale, kinds, presents.
 then? baleen, hump, back-fin, teeth; things whose
 peculiarities indiscriminately dispersed among sorts whales,
 without regard may nature structure in
 essential particulars. thus, sperm whale the
 humpbacked whale, hump; similitude ceases.
 then, humpbacked whale greenland whale, these
 baleen; similitude ceases. just the
 parts mentioned. various sorts whales,
 form irregular combinations; or, case one of
 detached, irregular isolation; utterly defy all
 general methodization formed upon basis. rock every one
 whale-naturalists split.
 
may possibly conceived that, internal parts the
 whale, anatomy—there, least, shall able hit the
 right classification. nay; thing, example, the
 greenland whale’s anatomy striking baleen? yet have
 seen baleen impossible correctly classify the
 greenland whale. descend bowels various
 leviathans, will find distinctions fiftieth part as
 available systematizer external ones already
 enumerated. remains? nothing take hold whales

 bibliographical system adopted; only
 one can possibly succeed, alone practicable. proceed.

chapter 33. specksnyder.
 
concerning officers whale-craft, seems good place
 set little domestic peculiarity ship-board, arising

 course marine whale-fleet.
 
large importance attached harpooneer’s vocation evinced
 fact, originally old dutch fishery, two centuries
 ago, command whale ship wholly lodged the
 person now called captain, divided an
 officer called specksnyder. literally word means fat-cutter;
 usage, however, time made equivalent chief harpooneer. in
 days, captain’s authority restricted navigation
 general management vessel; whale-hunting
 department concerns, specksnyder chief harpooneer
 reigned supreme. british greenland fishery, corrupted
 title specksioneer, old dutch official still retained, but
 former dignity sadly abridged. present ranks simply as
 senior harpooneer; such, one captain’s more

 harpooneers success whaling voyage largely depends, since
 american fishery important officer the

 ground) command ship’s deck also his; therefore grand
 political maxim demands, nominally live apart

now, grand distinction drawn officer man sea, is
 this—the first lives aft, last forward. hence, whale-ships and
 merchantmen alike, mates quarters captain; and
 so, too, american whalers harpooneers lodged in
 part ship. say, take meals in
 captain’s cabin, sleep place indirectly communicating with
 it.
 
though long period southern whaling voyage (by far longest
 voyages now ever made man), peculiar perils it, and
 community interest prevailing among company, whom, high

 common luck, together common vigilance, intrepidity, and
 hard work; though things cases tend beget a

chapter 35. mast-head.
 
pleasant weather, due rotation the
 seamen first mast-head came round.
 
american whalemen mast-heads manned almost
 simultaneously vessel’s leaving port; even though may
 fifteen thousand miles, more, sail ere reaching proper
 cruising ground. if, three, four, five years’ voyage she
 drawing nigh home anything empty her—say, empty vial
 even—then, mast-heads kept manned last; till her
 skysail-poles sail among spires port, altogether
 relinquish hope capturing one whale more.
 
now, business standing mast-heads, ashore afloat, a
 ancient interesting one, let us measure expatiate

 though progenitors, builders babel, must doubtless, by
 tower, intended rear loftiest mast-head asia,
 africa either; yet (ere final truck put it) great
 stone mast may said gone board, the
 dread gale god’s wrath; therefore, give babel
 builders priority egyptians. egyptians a
 nation mast-head standers, assertion based upon general
 belief among archæologists, first pyramids founded for
 astronomical purposes: theory singularly supported peculiar

 prodigious long upliftings legs, old astronomers were
 wont mount apex, sing new stars; even the
 look-outs modern ship sing sail, whale just bearing
 sight. saint stylites, famous christian hermit old times,

 dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; driven his

 everything last, literally died post. modern
 standers-of-mast-heads lifeless set; mere stone, iron,
 bronze men; who, though well capable facing stiff gale,
 still entirely incompetent business singing upon
 discovering strange sight. napoleon; who, upon top of
 column vendome, stands arms folded, one hundred and
 fifty feet air; careless, now, rules decks below;
 whether louis philippe, louis blanc, louis devil. great
 washington, too, stands high aloft towering main-mast in
 baltimore, like one hercules’ pillars, column marks that
 point human grandeur beyond mortals will go. admiral
 nelson, also, capstan gun-metal, stands mast-head in
 trafalgar square; ever obscured london smoke,
 token yet given hidden hero there; is
 smoke, must fire. neither great washington, napoleon, nor
 nelson, will answer single hail below, however madly invoked to
 befriend counsels distracted decks upon gaze;
 however may surmised, spirits penetrate the

“sir!” said mate, astonished order seldom never given on

but, eagerness again, ahab, now half-revolving his

 almost convulsively grasping it, addressed thus:—
 
“all ye mast-headers now heard give orders white
 whale. look ye! d’ye see spanish ounce gold?”—holding a

“does fan-tail little curious, sir, goes down?” said the

“and curious spout, too,” said daggoo, “very bushy, even a

“who told thee that?” cried ahab; pausing, “aye, starbuck; aye, my

 terrific, loud, animal sob, like heart-stricken moose;
 “aye, aye! accursed white whale razed me; made poor

“aye, aye!” shouted harpooneers seamen, running closer the

chapter 41. moby dick.
 
i, ishmael, one crew; shouts gone rest;

time past, though intervals only, unaccompanied,
 secluded white whale haunted uncivilized seas mostly
 frequented sperm whale fishermen. knew of
 existence; them, comparatively, knowingly seen

 whale-cruisers; disorderly way sprinkled entire
 watery circumference, many adventurously pushing quest
 along solitary latitudes, seldom never whole twelvemonth
 stretch, encounter single news-telling sail any
 sort; inordinate length separate voyage; irregularity
 times sailing home; these, circumstances,

 world-wide whaling-fleet special individualizing tidings
 concerning moby dick. hardly doubted, several vessels
 reported encountered, time, or

 presumption, say, whale question must other

 various unfrequent instances great ferocity, cunning, and
 malice monster attacked; therefore was, by
 accident ignorantly gave battle moby dick; hunters, perhaps,
 part, content ascribe peculiar terror bred,

who, previously hearing white whale, chance

 whale species. length, calamities ensue
 assaults—not restricted sprained wrists ankles, broken
 limbs, devouring amputations—but fatal last degree of
 fatality; repeated disastrous repulses, accumulating and
 piling terrors upon moby dick; things gone far shake
 fortitude many brave hunters, story white
 whale eventually come.
 
wild rumors sorts fail exaggerate, still more
 horrify true histories deadly encounters. do
 fabulous rumors naturally grow body surprising
 terrible events,—as smitten tree gives birth fungi; but, in
 maritime life, far terra firma, wild rumors
 abound, wherever adequate reality cling to.

 remotest waters, though sailed thousand miles, passed a

 aught hospitable beneath part sun; latitudes and

 wrapped influences tending make fancy pregnant many

wonder, then, ever gathering volume mere transit over

 half-formed fœtal suggestions supernatural agencies, which
 eventually invested moby dick new terrors unborrowed anything

 strike, rumors, least, heard white

still vital practical influences work.
 even present day original prestige sperm
 whale, fearfully distinguished species the
 leviathan, died minds whalemen body. are
 day among them, who, though intelligent courageous
 enough offering battle greenland right whale, would
 perhaps—either professional inexperience, incompetency, or
 timidity, decline contest sperm whale; rate, there
 plenty whalemen, especially among whaling nations not

 restricted ignoble monster primitively pursued north;
 seated hatches, men will hearken childish
 fireside interest awe, wild, strange tales southern

now tested reality might former legendary
 times thrown shadow it; find book
 naturalists—olassen povelson—declaring sperm whale to
 consternation every creature sea, also be
 incredibly ferocious continually athirst human blood.
 even late time cuvier’s, almost
 similar impressions effaced. natural history, baron
 affirms sight sperm whale, fish (sharks
 included) “struck lively terrors,” “often the

 violence cause instantaneous death.” however general
 experiences fishery may amend reports these; yet in
 full terribleness, even bloodthirsty item povelson, the
 superstitious belief is, vicissitudes their
 vocation, revived minds hunters.
 
overawed rumors portents concerning him, few

nevertheless, were, even face things

 chancing hear distantly vaguely, without the
 specific details certain calamity, without superstitious
 accompaniments, sufficiently hardy flee battle if
 offered.
 
one wild suggestions referred to, last coming linked
 white whale minds superstitiously inclined, was
 unearthly conceit moby dick ubiquitous; had
 actually encountered opposite latitudes one same
 instant time.
 
nor, credulous minds must been, conceit
 altogether without faint show superstitious probability. as
 secrets currents seas never yet divulged,
 even erudite research; hidden ways sperm
 whale beneath surface remain, great part, unaccountable to
 pursuers; time time originated curious
 contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning
 mystic modes whereby, sounding great depth, he
 transports vast swiftness widely distant
 points.
 
thing well known american english whale-ships, and
 well thing placed upon authoritative record years ago scoresby,

 bodies found barbs harpoons darted greenland

 times inland strello mountain portugal (near whose top there
 said lake wrecks ships floated the

 fully equalled realities whalemen.
 
forced familiarity, then, prodigies these; and
 knowing repeated, intrepid assaults, white whale had
 escaped alive; much matter surprise whalemen
 go still superstitions; declaring moby dick not
 ubiquitous, immortal (for immortality ubiquity in
 time); though groves spears planted flanks, he
 still swim away unharmed; indeed ever made to
 spout thick blood, sight ghastly deception; for
 unensanguined billows hundreds leagues away, unsullied
 jet seen.
 
even stripped supernatural surmisings, enough in

 shrouded hue, that, end, gained distinctive
 appellation white whale; name, indeed, literally justified by
 vivid aspect, seen gliding high noon dark blue
 sea, leaving milky-way wake creamy foam, spangled golden
 gleamings.
 
unwonted magnitude, remarkable hue, yet his
 deformed lower jaw, much invested whale natural
 terror, unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to
 specific accounts, evinced assaults.
 all, treacherous retreats struck dismay than
 perhaps aught else. for, swimming exulting pursuers,
 every apparent symptom alarm, several times known
 turn round suddenly, and, bearing upon them, either stave their
 boats splinters, drive back consternation ship.
 
already several fatalities attended chase. though similar
 disasters, however little bruited ashore, means unusual in
 fishery; yet, instances, seemed white whale’s
 infernal aforethought ferocity, every dismembering death
 caused, wholly regarded inflicted an
 unintelligent agent.
 
judge, then, pitches inflamed, distracted fury minds of
 desperate hunters impelled, amid chips chewed

 though pre-eminence applies human race itself,
 giving white man ideal mastership every dusky tribe; and
 though, besides, this, whiteness even made significant of

 though mortal sympathies symbolizings, hue is

hence substantiated times, upon well known separate

now, pequod sailed nantucket beginning the

phantoms, seemed, flitting side

 deemed one spare boats, though technically called the
 captain’s, account hanging starboard quarter. the
 figure now stood bows tall swart, one white
 tooth evilly protruding steel-like lips. rumpled chinese

yet wondering ship’s company gazing upon these
 strangers, ahab cried white-turbaned old man head,
 “all ready there, fedallah?”
 
“ready,” half-hissed reply.
 
“lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across deck. “lower away

 sailors, goat-like, leaped rolling ship’s side tossed

hardly pulled ship’s lee, fourth

 showed five strangers rowing ahab, who, standing erect the
 stern, loudly hailed starbuck, stubb, flask, spread themselves
 widely, cover large expanse water. their
 eyes riveted upon swart fedallah crew, inmates of
 boats obeyed command.
 
“captain ahab?—” said starbuck.
 
“spread yourselves,” cried ahab; “give way, four boats. thou,
 flask, pull leeward!”
 
“aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little king-post, sweeping round his
 great steering oar. “lay back!” addressing crew.
 “there!—there!—there again! blows right ahead, boys!—lay
 back!”
 
“never heed yonder yellow boys, archy.”
 
“oh, don’t mind ’em, sir,” said archy; “i knew now.
 didn’t hear ’em hold? didn’t tell cabaco it?
 say ye, cabaco? stowaways, mr. flask.”
 
“pull, pull, fine hearts-alive; pull, children; pull, little

 still showed signs uneasiness. “why don’t break backbones,
 boys? stare at? chaps yonder boat? tut! they

 indolent himself, loungingly managed steering-oar, so
 broadly gaped—open-mouthed times—that mere sight a

“mr. starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! word ye, sir, ye

“halloa!” returned starbuck, turning round single inch he
 spoke; still earnestly whisperingly urging crew; face set

“what think ye yellow boys, sir!”
 
“smuggled board, somehow, ship sailed. (strong, strong,

now advent outlandish strangers critical instant

 awakened sort superstitious amazement ship’s

 abroad among them, though indeed credited then, some

meantime, ahab, hearing officers, sided the
 furthest windward, still ranging ahead boats; a
 circumstance bespeaking potent crew pulling him. tiger
 yellow creatures seemed steel whalebone; like five
 trip-hammers rose fell regular strokes strength, which
 periodically started boat along water like horizontal burst

 fixed, boat’s five oars seen simultaneously peaked. boat
 crew sat motionless sea. instantly three spread boats in
 rear paused way. whales irregularly settled bodily

 movement, though closer vicinity ahab observed it.
 
“every man look along oars!” cried starbuck. “thou, queequeg,
 stand up!”
 
nimbly springing triangular raised box bow, savage
 stood erect there, intensely eager eyes gazed towards the
 spot chase last descried. likewise upon extreme

 eyeing vast blue eye sea.
 
far distant flask’s boat also lying breathlessly still;

“good mast-head any, sir. will mount?”
 
“that will, thank ye much, fine fellow; wish you

 stubb, wont cases, seems, resolved solace the
 languishing interval pipe. withdrew hatband,

“look chap now,” philosophically drawled stubb, who, his
 unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained teeth, a

“give way, men,” whispered starbuck, drawing still aft the

 nevertheless taken private measures touching that

 though herds whales seen night, one whaleman a
 hundred venture lowering them. may think what
 emotions, then, seamen beheld old oriental perched aloft at
 unusual hours; turban moon, companions one sky. but
 when, spending uniform interval several successive
 nights without uttering single sound; when, silence,
 unearthly voice heard announcing silvery, moon-lit jet,
 every reclining mariner started feet winged spirit
 lighted rigging, hailed mortal crew. “there she
 blows!” trump judgment blown, quivered
 more; yet still felt terror; rather pleasure. though was
 unwonted hour, yet impressive cry, deliriously
 exciting, almost every soul board instinctively desired a
 lowering.
 
walking deck quick, side-lunging strides, ahab commanded the
 t’gallant sails royals set, every stunsail spread. the
 best man ship must take helm. then, every mast-head
 manned, piled-up craft rolled wind. strange,
 upheaving, lifting tendency taffrail breeze filling hollows
 many sails, made buoyant, hovering deck feel like air

 influences struggling her—one mount direct heaven, the
 drive yawingly horizontal goal. watched
 ahab’s face night, thought also two
 different things warring. one live leg made lively
 echoes along deck, every stroke dead limb sounded like a
 coffin-tap. life death old man walked. though ship
 swiftly sped, though every eye, like arrows, eager
 glances shot, yet silvery jet seen night. every
 sailor swore saw once, second time.
 
midnight-spout almost grown forgotten thing, when, days

 descried all; upon making sail overtake it, it
 disappeared never been. served us night after

 somehow seeming every distinct repetition advancing still

 treacherously beckoning us on, order the
 monster might turn round upon us, rend us last remotest

temporary apprehensions, vague awful, derived a
 wondrous potency contrasting serenity weather, in
 which, beneath blue blandness, thought lurked a
 devilish charm, days days voyaged along, seas so
 wearily, lonesomely mild, space, repugnance vengeful

but, last, turning eastward, cape winds began
 howling around us, rose fell upon long, troubled seas

 blast, gored dark waves madness, till, like showers of
 silver chips, foam-flakes flew bulwarks; this
 desolate vacuity life went away, gave place sights more
 dismal before.
 
close bows, strange forms water darted hither thither
 us; thick rear flew inscrutable sea-ravens. and
 every morning, perched stays, rows birds seen; and
 spite hootings, long time obstinately clung hemp,
 though deemed ship drifting, uninhabited craft; a
 thing appointed desolation, therefore fit roosting-place for
 homeless selves. heaved heaved, still unrestingly heaved
 black sea, vast tides conscience; great

cape good hope, call ye? rather cape tormentoso, called

blackness elements, ahab, though assuming for
 time almost continual command drenched dangerous

 addressed mates. tempestuous times like these, everything
 aloft secured, nothing can done but
 passively await issue gale. captain crew become
 practical fatalists. so, ivory leg inserted its
 accustomed hole, one hand firmly grasping shroud, ahab for

chapter 53. gam.
 
ostensible reason ahab go board whaler had
 spoken this: wind betokened storms. even this
 case, all, perhaps, boarded
 her—judging subsequent conduct similar occasions—if had
 that, process hailing, obtained negative answer
 question put. for, eventually turned out, cared not
 consort, even five minutes, stranger captain, except he
 contribute information absorbingly sought. but
 might remain inadequately estimated, something said
 peculiar usages whaling-vessels meeting other
 foreign seas, especially common cruising-ground.
 
two strangers crossing pine barrens new york state, the
 equally desolate salisbury plain england; casually encountering
 inhospitable wilds, twain, life of
 them, well avoid mutual salutation; stopping moment
 interchange news; and, perhaps, sitting and
 resting concert: then, much natural upon the
 illimitable pine barrens salisbury plains sea, two whaling
 vessels descrying ends earth—off lone
 fanning’s island, far away king’s mills; much natural,
 say, circumstances ships only
 interchange hails, come still closer, friendly and
 sociable contact. especially seem matter of
 course, case vessels owned one seaport, whose
 captains, officers, men personally known to
 other; consequently, sorts dear domestic things to
 talk about.
 
long absent ship, outward-bounder, perhaps, letters on

 whaling vessels crossing other’s track cruising-ground

 agreeable chat. meet the
 sympathies sailors, likewise peculiar
 congenialities arising common pursuit mutually shared

difference country make essential difference;
 is, long parties speak one language, case
 americans english. though, sure, small number
 english whalers, meetings often occur, when
 occur apt sort shyness them;
 englishman rather reserved, yankee, not
 fancy sort thing anybody himself. besides, english
 whalers sometimes affect kind metropolitan superiority the
 american whalers; regarding long, lean nantucketer, his
 nondescript provincialisms, sort sea-peasant. this
 superiority english whalemen really consist, be
 hard say, seeing yankees one day, collectively, kill
 whales english, collectively, ten years. this
 harmless little foible english whale-hunters, the
 nantucketer take much heart; probably, knows
 foibles himself.
 
so, then, see ships separately sailing sea, the
 whalers reason sociable—and so. whereas, some
 merchant ships crossing other’s wake mid-atlantic, will
 oftentimes pass without much single word recognition,
 mutually cutting high seas, like brace dandies
 broadway; time indulging, perhaps, finical criticism
 upon other’s rig. men-of-war, chance meet at

quitting unprofessional attempts, let us glance those

 know. old harris’s collection voyages some
 plates whales extracted dutch book voyages, a.d. 1671,
 entitled “a whaling voyage spitzbergen ship jonas the
 whale, peter peterson friesland, master.” one plates the
 whales, like great rafts logs, represented lying among
 ice-isles, white bears running living backs. another
 plate, prodigious blunder made representing whale with
 perpendicular flukes.
 
again, imposing quarto, written one captain
 colnett, post captain english navy, entitled “a voyage round
 cape horn south seas, purpose extending the
 spermaceti whale fisheries.” book outline purporting to
 “picture physeter spermaceti whale, drawn scale from
 one killed coast mexico, august, 1793, hoisted deck.”
 doubt captain veracious picture taken the

 eye applied, according accompanying scale,
 full grown sperm whale, make eye whale a

 give us jonah looking eye!
 
conscientious compilations natural history the
 benefit young tender, free heinousness of
 mistake. look popular work “goldsmith’s animated nature.” in
 abridged london edition 1807, plates alleged
 “whale” “narwhale.” wish seem inelegant, this
 unsightly whale looks much like amputated sow; and, the
 narwhale, one glimpse enough amaze one, this
 nineteenth century hippogriff palmed genuine upon

then, again, 1825, bernard germain, count lacépède, great
 naturalist, published scientific systemized whale book, wherein are

manifold mistakes depicting whale very

 though elephants stood full-lengths, living

 leviathan’s articulated bones. fact, great hunter says, the
 mere skeleton whale bears relation fully

 also curiously displayed side fin, bones which
 almost exactly answer bones human hand, minus the
 thumb. four regular bone-fingers, index, middle, ring,
 little finger. permanently lodged fleshy

 recklessly whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous stubb one
 day, “he can never truly said handle us without mittens.”
 
reasons, then, way may look it, must needs
 conclude great leviathan one creature world

 considerable degree exactness. earthly way finding

but, yet, stubb heeded mumblings banquet was

“cook, cook!—where’s old fleece?” cried length, widening his
 legs still further, form secure base supper;
 and, time darting fork dish, stabbing
 lance; “cook, cook!—sail way, cook!”
 
old black, high glee previously
 roused warm hammock unseasonable hour, came
 shambling along galley, for, like many old blacks, was
 something matter knee-pans, keep well
 scoured like pans; old fleece, called him, came
 shuffling limping along, assisting step tongs, which,
 clumsy fashion, made straightened iron hoops; old
 ebony floundered along, obedience word command, came
 dead stop opposite side stubb’s sideboard; when, with
 hands folded him, resting two-legged cane, he
 bowed arched back still over, time sideways
 inclining head, bring best ear play.
 
“cook,” said stubb, rapidly lifting rather reddish morsel his
 mouth, “don’t think steak rather overdone? you’ve been
 beating steak much, cook; it’s tender. don’t always say
 good, whale-steak must tough? sharks
 now side, don’t see prefer tough rare? a
 shindy kicking up! cook, go talk ’em; tell ’em are
 welcome help civilly, moderation, must
 keep quiet. blast me, can hear voice. away, cook, and
 deliver message. here, take lantern,” snatching one his
 sideboard; “now then, go preach ’em!”
 
sullenly taking offered lantern, old fleece limped across deck
 bulwarks; then, one hand dropping light low over
 sea, get good view congregation, other
 hand solemnly flourished tongs, leaning far side in
 mumbling voice began addressing sharks, stubb, softly
 crawling behind, overheard said.
 
“fellow-critters: i’se ordered say dat must stop dat dam

 dat can fill dam bellies hatchings, gor! you

“cook,” interposed stubb, accompanying word sudden slap
 shoulder,—“cook! why, damn eyes, mustn’t swear way
 you’re preaching. that’s way convert sinners, cook!”
 
“who dat? den preach yourself,” sullenly turning go.
 
“no, cook; go on, go on.”
 
“well, den, belubed fellow-critters:”—
 
“right!” exclaimed stubb, approvingly, “coax ’em it; try that,” and
 fleece continued.
 
“do sharks, natur wery woracious, yet zay you,
 fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness—’top dat dam slappin’ ob de
 tail! tink hear, spose keep dam slappin’ and
 bitin’ dare?”
 
“cook,” cried stubb, collaring him, “i won’t swearing. talk
 ’em gentlemanly.”
 
sermon proceeded.
 
“your woraciousness, fellow-critters, don’t blame ye much for; dat
 natur, can’t helped; gobern dat wicked natur, dat is
 pint. sharks, sartin; gobern shark you, why

“well done, old fleece!” cried stubb, “that’s christianity; go on.”
 
“no use goin’ on; dam willains will keep scougin’ slappin’

“upon soul, opinion; give benediction,

upon this, fleece, holding hands fishy mob, raised his

“cussed fellow-critters! kick damndest row ever can; fill

“now, cook,” said stubb, resuming supper capstan; “stand

“all dention,” said fleece, stooping upon tongs the
 desired position.
 
“well,” said stubb, helping freely meanwhile; “i shall now go
 back subject steak. first place, old you,
 cook?”
 
“what dat wid ’teak,” said old black, testily.
 
“silence! old you, cook?”
 
“’bout ninety, dey say,” gloomily muttered.
 
“and lived world hard upon one hundred years, cook,
 don’t know yet cook whale-steak?” rapidly bolting another
 mouthful last word, morsel seemed continuation the

“’hind hatchway, ferry-boat, goin’ ober roanoke.”
 
“born ferry-boat! that’s queer, too. want know what
 country born in, cook!”
 
“didn’t say roanoke country?” cried sharply.
 
“no, didn’t, cook; i’ll tell i’m coming to, cook. you
 must go home born again; don’t know cook a
 whale-steak yet.”
 
“bress soul, cook noder one,” growled, angrily, turning
 round depart.
 
“come back, cook;—here, hand tongs;—now take bit steak
 there, tell think steak cooked be? take
 it, say”—holding tongs towards him—“take it, taste it.”
 
faintly smacking withered lips moment, old negro
 muttered, “best cooked ’teak eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”
 
“cook,” said stubb, squaring more; “do belong the
 church?”
 
“passed one cape-down,” said old man sullenly.
 
“and life passed holy church cape-town,
 doubtless overheard holy parson addressing hearers as
 beloved fellow-creatures, you, cook! yet come here,
 tell dreadful lie just now, eh?” said stubb.
 “where expect go to, cook?”
 
“go bed berry soon,” mumbled, half-turning spoke.
 
“avast! heave to! mean die, cook. it’s awful question.
 now what’s answer?”
 
“when dis old brack man dies,” said negro slowly, changing his
 whole air demeanor, “he hisself won’t go nowhere; bressed
 angel will come fetch him.”
 
“fetch him? how? coach four, fetched elijah? fetch
 where?”
 
“up dere,” said fleece, holding tongs straight head, and
 keeping solemnly.
 
“so, then, expect go main-top, you, cook, when
 dead? don’t know higher climb, colder it
 gets? main-top, eh?”
 
“didn’t say dat t’all,” said fleece, sulks.
 
“you said there, didn’t you? now look yourself, see where

 crawling lubber’s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, don’t
 get there, except go regular way, round rigging. it’s a
 ticklish business, must done, else it’s go. none us

“all ’dention,” said old black, hands placed desired,
 vainly wriggling grizzled head, get ears front at
 one time.
 
“well then, cook, see whale-steak bad,
 put sight soon possible; see that,
 don’t you? well, future, cook another whale-steak for

fleece hardly got three paces off, recalled.
 
“cook, give cutlets supper to-morrow night mid-watch.
 d’ye hear? away sail, then.—halloa! stop! make bow you
 go.—avast heaving again! whale-balls breakfast—don’t forget.”
 
“wish, gor! whale eat him, ’stead eat whale. i’m bressed if

 limping away; sage ejaculation went hammock.

now gabriel started feet.
 
“think, think fevers, yellow bilious! beware horrible
 plague!”
 
“gabriel! gabriel!” cried captain mayhew; “thou must either—” that
 instant headlong wave shot boat far ahead, seethings

“hast thou seen white whale?” demanded ahab, boat drifted

“think, think thy whale-boat, stoven sunk! beware the

“i tell thee again, gabriel, that—” boat tore ahead if

seemed jeroboam long left home, upon speaking

 sometimes, nothing injured man thus annihilated;

whole calamity, falling form macey, plainly

mayhew concluded narration, ahab put questions him,
 stranger captain forbear inquiring whether he
 intended hunt white whale, opportunity offer. which
 ahab answered—“aye.” straightway, then, gabriel started to
 feet, glaring upon old man, vehemently exclaimed, with
 downward pointed finger—“think, think blasphemer—dead, down
 there!—beware blasphemer’s end!”
 
ahab stolidly turned aside; said mayhew, “captain, just
 bethought letter-bag; letter one thy
 officers, mistake not. starbuck, look bag.”
 
every whale-ship takes goodly number letters various
 ships, whose delivery persons may addressed,
 depends upon mere chance encountering four oceans.
 thus, letters never reach mark; many received

soon starbuck returned letter hand. sorely

 consequence kept dark locker cabin. a
 letter, death might well post-boy.
 
“can’st read it?” cried ahab. “give me, man. aye, aye, it’s but
 dim scrawl;—what’s this?” studying out, starbuck took a
 long cutting-spade pole, knife slightly split end, to
 insert letter there, way, hand boat, without
 coming closer ship.
 
meantime, ahab holding letter, muttered, “mr. har—yes, mr. harry—(a
 woman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, i’ll wager)—aye—mr. harry macey,
 ship jeroboam;—why it’s macey, he’s dead!”
 
“poor fellow! poor fellow! wife,” sighed mayhew; “but let
 it.”
 
“nay, keep thyself,” cried gabriel ahab; “thou art soon going
 way.”
 
“curses throttle thee!” yelled ahab. “captain mayhew, stand now to
 receive it”; taking fatal missive starbuck’s hands, he
 caught slit pole, reached towards the
 boat. so, oarsmen expectantly desisted rowing;
 boat drifted little towards ship’s stern; that, by
 magic, letter suddenly ranged along gabriel’s eager hand. he
 clutched instant, seized boat-knife, impaling the
 letter it, sent thus loaded back ship. fell ahab’s
 feet. gabriel shrieked comrades give way their

 boats must fast. interval passed boats in
 plain sight, act dragged right towards ship the

 flinging drippings, drops fell like bits broken

 boats free fly. fagged whale abated speed,
 blindly altering course, went round stern ship
 towing two boats him, performed complete

meantime, hauled upon lines, till close
 flanking sides, stubb answered flask lance lance;
 thus round round pequod battle went, the
 multitudes sharks swum round sperm whale’s body,
 rushed fresh blood spilled, thirstily drinking every

last spout grew thick, frightful roll vomit, he
 turned upon back corpse.
 
two headsmen engaged making fast cords flukes,
 ways getting mass readiness towing, some
 conversation ensued them.
 
“i wonder old man wants lump foul lard,” said
 stubb, without disgust thought so
 ignoble leviathan.
 
“wants it?” said flask, coiling spare line boat’s bow,
 “did never hear ship sperm whale’s
 head hoisted starboard side, time right
 whale’s larboard; never hear, stubb, ship can
 never afterwards capsize?”
 
“why not?
 
“i don’t know, heard gamboge ghost fedallah saying so,

 he’ll charm ship good last. don’t half like chap,
 stubb. ever notice tusk sort carved

“sink him! never look all; ever get chance a

“he sleeps boots, don’t he? hasn’t got hammock; i’ve

“no doubt, it’s cursed tail; coils down, ye
 see, eye rigging.”
 
“what’s old man much for?”
 
“striking swap bargain, suppose.”
 
“bargain?—about what?”
 
“why, ye see, old man hard bent white whale, and
 devil trying come round him, get swap away

 he’ll surrender moby dick.”
 
“pooh! stubb, skylarking; can fedallah that?”
 
“i don’t know, flask, devil curious chap, wicked
 one, tell ye. why, say went sauntering old
 flag-ship once, switching tail devilish easy and
 gentlemanlike, inquiring old governor home. well, he
 home, asked devil wanted. devil, switching
 hoofs, says, ‘i want john.’ ‘what for?’ says old
 governor. ‘what business yours,’ says devil, getting
 mad,—‘i want use him.’ ‘take him,’ says governor—and the
 lord, flask, devil didn’t give john asiatic cholera before

 sharp—ain’t ready there? well, then, pull ahead, let’s get
 whale alongside.”
 
“i think remember story telling,” said flask,
 last two boats slowly advancing burden
 towards ship, “but can’t remember where.”
 
“three spaniards? adventures three bloody-minded soldadoes?
 ye read there, flask? guess ye did?”
 
“no: never saw book; heard it, though. now, tell me,
 stubb, suppose devil speaking just now, was

“am man helped kill whale? doesn’t devil live

“how old suppose fedallah is, stubb?”
 
“do see mainmast there?” pointing ship; “well, that’s
 figure one; now take hoops pequod’s hold, string
 along row mast, oughts, see; well, that
 wouldn’t begin fedallah’s age. coopers creation
 couldn’t show hoops enough make oughts enough.”
 
“but see here, stubb, thought little boasted just now, you
 meant give fedallah sea-toss, got good chance. now, if
 he’s old hoops come to, going to

 that?
 
“give good ducking, anyhow.”
 
“but he’d crawl back.”
 
“duck again; keep ducking him.”
 
“suppose take head duck you, though—yes, and
 drown you—what then?”
 
“i like see try it; i’d give pair black

“do suppose fedallah wants kidnap captain ahab?”
 
“do suppose it? you’ll know long, flask. going now

 i’ll make grab pocket tail, take capstan,

“and will tail, stubb?”
 
“do it? sell ox whip get home;—what else?”
 
“now, mean say, saying along, stubb?”
 
“mean mean, ship.”
 
boats hailed, tow whale larboard side,
 fluke chains necessaries already prepared for
 securing him.
 
“didn’t tell so?” said flask; “yes, you’ll soon see right
 whale’s head hoisted opposite parmacetti’s.”
 
good time, flask’s saying proved true. before, pequod steeply
 leaned towards sperm whale’s head, now, counterpoise of
 heads, regained even keel; though sorely strained, may
 well believe. so, one side hoist locke’s head, go
 way; now, side, hoist kant’s come
 back again; poor plight. thus, minds ever keep
 trimming boat. oh, ye foolish! throw thunder-heads overboard,

first place, struck general contrast between
 heads. massive enough conscience; a
 certain mathematical symmetry sperm whale’s right

 dignity heightened pepper salt colour head the

 fishermen technically call “grey-headed whale.”
 
let us now note least dissimilar heads—namely, two
 important organs, eye ear. far back side the
 head, low down, near angle either whale’s jaw, you
 narrowly search, will last see lashless eye, would
 fancy young colt’s eye; proportion the

now, peculiar sideway position whale’s eyes, is

moreover, animals can now think of, eyes
 planted imperceptibly blend visual power, to
 produce one picture two brain; peculiar position of
 whale’s eyes, effectually divided many cubic feet of

chapter 75. right whale’s head—contrasted view.
 
crossing deck, let us now good long look right
 whale’s head.
 
general shape noble sperm whale’s head may compared a
 roman war-chariot (especially front, broadly
 rounded); so, broad view, right whale’s head bears rather
 inelegant resemblance gigantic galliot-toed shoe. two hundred

 must grant far greater age right whale first glance
 will seem reasonable.
 
old times, seem prevailed curious fancies
 concerning blinds. one voyager purchas calls wondrous
 “whiskers” inside whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a
 third old gentleman hackluyt uses following elegant language:
 “there two hundred fifty fins growing side his
 upper _chop_, arch tongue side mouth.”
 
*this reminds us right whale really sort whisker, or
 rather moustache, consisting scattered white hairs the

every one knows, “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”
 “blinds,” whatever please, furnish ladies busks and

 ancient dames moved gaily, though jaws whale, as
 may say; even so, shower, like thoughtlessness, we

chapter 76. battering-ram.
 
ere quitting, nonce, sperm whale’s head, you,

chapter 77. great heidelburgh tun.
 
now comes baling case. comprehend aright, must
 know something curious internal structure thing operated
 upon.
 
regarding sperm whale’s head solid oblong, may, an
 inclined plane, sideways divide two quoins,* whereof lower

 unctuous mass wholly free bones; broad forward end forming the
 expanded vertical apparent forehead whale. middle the

lower subdivided part, called junk, one immense honeycomb of

 heidelburgh tun sperm whale. famous great tierce is

 innumerable strange devices emblematical adornment his
 wondrous tun. moreover, heidelburgh always replenished
 excellent wines rhenish valleys, tun
 whale contains far precious oily
 vintages; namely, highly-prized spermaceti, absolutely pure,
 limpid, odoriferous state. precious substance found
 unalloyed part creature. though life remains
 perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure air, death, soon
 begins concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, when
 first thin delicate ice just forming water. large whale’s
 case generally yields five hundred gallons sperm, though from
 unavoidable circumstances, considerable spilled, leaks, and
 dribbles away, otherwise irrevocably lost ticklish
 business securing can.
 
know fine costly material heidelburgh tun was
 coated within, superlative richness coating not
 possibly compared silken pearl-coloured membrane, like
 lining fine pelisse, forming inner surface sperm
 whale’s case.
 
will seen heidelburgh tun sperm whale
 embraces entire length entire top head; since—as
 elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third whole
 length creature, setting length eighty feet
 good sized whale, twenty-six feet the
 depth tun, lengthwise hoisted a
 ship’s side.
 
decapitating whale, operator’s instrument brought
 close spot entrance subsequently forced the

 careless, untimely stroke invade sanctuary wastingly
 let invaluable contents. decapitated end the
 head, also, last elevated water, retained in
 position enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen
 combinations, one side, make quite wilderness ropes that
 quarter.
 
thus much said, attend now, pray you, marvellous and—in
 particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby sperm
 whale’s great heidelburgh tun tapped.
 

chapter 78. cistern buckets.
 
nimble cat, tashtego mounts aloft; without altering erect

 travelling single-sheaved block. securing block, that
 hangs yard-arm, swings one end rope, till it

 three alert hands. last now hoist bucket within grasp the
 indian, another person reached long pole.
 inserting pole bucket, tashtego downward guides the

 whether place stood treacherous oozy; or
 whether evil one fall so, without

“man overboard!” cried daggoo, amid general consternation first

 terrible tumult. looking side, saw before
 lifeless head throbbing heaving just surface sea,

instant, daggoo, summit head, clearing
 whip—which somehow got foul great cutting tackles—a
 sharp cracking noise heard; unspeakable horror all,

“come down, come down!” yelled seamen daggoo, one hand

“in heaven’s name, man,” cried stubb, “are ramming home cartridge

 top head? avast, will ye!”
 
“stand clear tackle!” cried voice like bursting a
 rocket.
 
almost instant, thunder-boom, enormous mass
 dropped sea, like niagara’s table-rock whirlpool; the
 suddenly relieved hull rolled away it, far glittering
 copper; caught breath, half swinging—now the
 sailors’ heads, now water—daggoo, thick mist of
 spray, dimly beheld clinging pendulous tackles, poor,
 buried-alive tashtego sinking utterly bottom the
 sea! hardly blinding vapor cleared away, naked
 figure boarding-sword hand, one swift moment seen

 now jumped boat alongside, pushed little the

“ha! ha!” cried daggoo, once, now quiet, swinging perch

“both! both!—it both!”—cried daggoo joyful shout; and
 soon after, queequeg seen boldly striking one hand, and

now, noble rescue accomplished? why, diving the

 lunges near bottom, scuttle large hole there; then
 dropping sword, thrust long arm far inwards upwards,
 hauled poor tash head. averred, upon first

 be, might occasion great trouble;—he had
 thrust back leg, dexterous heave toss, wrought a

 good old way—head foremost. great head itself, was
 well expected.
 
thus, courage great skill obstetrics of

 however, starbuck, ordering affairs, hung to

 snap, every fastening went adrift; ship righted, carcase sank.
 
now, occasional inevitable sinking recently killed sperm
 whale curious thing; fisherman yet adequately
 accounted it. usually dead sperm whale floats great

 broken-hearted creatures, pads lard diminished their

 sinking caused uncommon specific gravity fish so
 sinking, consequent upon absence buoyant matter him. it
 so. young whales, highest health, swelling with
 noble aspirations, prematurely cut warm flush may of

 buoyant heroes sometimes sink.
 
said, however, sperm whale far less liable this
 accident species. one sort go down, twenty
 right whales do. difference species doubt imputable
 small degree greater quantity bone right whale;
 venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing ton; this
 incumbrance sperm whale wholly free. instances

gallant perseus, jupiter, first whaleman; to
 eternal honor calling said, first whale
 attacked brotherhood killed sordid intent.
 knightly days profession, bore arms
 succor distressed, fill men’s lamp-feeders. every one
 knows fine story perseus andromeda; lovely
 andromeda, daughter king, tied rock sea-coast,
 leviathan act carrying off, perseus, the
 prince whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned monster, and
 delivered married maid. admirable artistic exploit,
 rarely achieved best harpooneers present day; inasmuch as
 leviathan slain first dart. let man doubt
 arkite story; ancient joppa, now jaffa, syrian
 coast, one pagan temples, stood many ages vast
 skeleton whale, city’s legends inhabitants
 asserted identical bones monster perseus slew.
 romans took joppa, skeleton carried italy in
 triumph. seems singular suggestively important this
 story, this: joppa jonah set sail.
 
akin adventure perseus andromeda—indeed, supposed
 indirectly derived it—is famous story st. george and
 dragon; dragon maintain whale; many
 old chronicles whales dragons strangely jumbled together, and
 often stand other. “thou art lion waters, a
 dragon sea,” saith ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning whale; in
 truth, versions bible use word itself. besides, it
 much subtract glory exploit st. george but
 encountered crawling reptile land, instead battle
 great monster deep. man may kill snake, only
 perseus, st. george, coffin, heart march
 boldly whale.
 
let modern paintings scene mislead us; though the
 creature encountered valiant whaleman old vaguely
 represented griffin-like shape, though battle depicted
 land saint horseback, yet considering great ignorance
 times, true form whale unknown artists;
 considering perseus’ case, st. george’s whale might have
 crawled beach; considering animal
 ridden st. george might large seal, sea-horse;
 bearing mind, will appear altogether incompatible

 hold so-called dragon great leviathan himself.
 fact, placed strict piercing truth, whole story
 will fare like fish, flesh, fowl idol philistines,

 stump fishy part remained. thus, then, one noble
 stamp, even whaleman, tutelary guardian england; by
 good rights, harpooneers nantucket enrolled most
 noble order st. george. therefore, let knights that
 honorable company (none whom, venture say, ever do
 whale like great patron), let never eye nantucketer
 disdain, since even woollen frocks tarred trowsers we
 much better entitled st. george’s decoration they.
 
whether admit hercules among us not, concerning long
 remained dubious: though according greek mythologies, that
 antique crockett kit carson—that brawny doer rejoicing good
 deeds, swallowed thrown whale; still, whether that
 strictly makes whaleman him, might mooted. nowhere
 appears ever actually harpooned fish, unless, indeed, from
 inside. nevertheless, may deemed sort involuntary
 whaleman; rate whale caught him, whale. i
 claim one clan.
 
but, best contradictory authorities, grecian story of
 hercules whale considered derived still more
 ancient hebrew story jonah whale; vice versâ; certainly
 similar. claim demi-god then, the
 prophet?
 
heroes, saints, demigods, prophets alone comprise whole
 roll order. grand master still named; like
 royal kings old times, find head waters fraternity in
 nothing short great gods themselves. wondrous oriental
 story now rehearsed shaster, gives us dread

 us divine vishnoo lord;—vishnoo, who, first
 ten earthly incarnations, ever set apart sanctified

 vedas lying bottom waters; vishnoo became

 man rides horse called horseman?
 
perseus, st. george, hercules, jonah, vishnoo! there’s a
 member-roll you! club whaleman’s can head like
 that?
 

chapter 83. jonah historically regarded.
 
reference made historical story jonah whale in
 preceding chapter. now nantucketers rather distrust this
 historical story jonah whale. some
 sceptical greeks romans, who, standing orthodox pagans
 times, equally doubted story hercules whale,
 arion dolphin; yet doubting traditions did
 make traditions one whit less facts, that.
 
one old sag-harbor whaleman’s chief reason questioning hebrew
 story this:—he one quaint old-fashioned bibles,
 embellished curious, unscientific plates; one represented
 jonah’s whale two spouts head—a peculiarity true with
 respect species leviathan (the right whale, the
 varieties order), concerning fishermen this
 saying, “a penny roll choke him”; swallow small.
 but, this, bishop jebb’s anticipative answer ready. not
 necessary, hints bishop, consider jonah tombed the
 whale’s belly, temporarily lodged part mouth. and
 seems reasonable enough good bishop. truly, right
 whale’s mouth accommodate couple whist-tables, and
 comfortably seat players. possibly, too, jonah might have
 ensconced hollow tooth; but, second thoughts, right
 whale toothless.
 
another reason sag-harbor (he went name) urged his
 want faith matter prophet, something obscurely in
 reference incarcerated body whale’s gastric juices. but
 objection likewise falls ground, german exegetist
 supposes jonah must taken refuge floating body a
 _dead_ whale—even french soldiers russian campaign turned
 dead horses tents, crawled them. besides, has
 divined continental commentators, jonah was
 thrown overboard joppa ship, straightway effected his
 escape another vessel near by, vessel whale a
 figure-head; and, add, possibly called “the whale,” some
 craft nowadays christened “shark,” “gull,” “eagle.” nor
 wanting learned exegetists opined the
 whale mentioned book jonah merely meant life-preserver—an
 inflated bag wind—which endangered prophet swam to, was
 saved watery doom. poor sag-harbor, therefore, seems worsted all
 round. still another reason want faith. was
 this, remember right: jonah swallowed whale the
 mediterranean sea, three days vomited somewhere
 within three days’ journey nineveh, city tigris, much
 three days’ journey across nearest point the
 mediterranean coast. that?
 
way whale land prophet within
 short distance nineveh? yes. might carried round by
 way cape good hope. speak passage
 whole length mediterranean, another passage up
 persian gulf red sea, supposition involve the
 complete circumnavigation africa three days, speak of
 tigris waters, near site nineveh, shallow any
 whale swim in. besides, idea jonah’s weathering cape of
 good hope early day wrest honor discovery of
 great headland bartholomew diaz, reputed discoverer, and
 make modern history liar.
 
foolish arguments old sag-harbor evinced his
 foolish pride reason—a thing still reprehensible him, seeing
 little learning except picked the
 sun sea. say shows foolish, impious pride, and
 abominable, devilish rebellion reverend clergy. a
 portuguese catholic priest, idea jonah’s going nineveh
 via cape good hope advanced signal magnification the
 general miracle. was. besides, day, highly
 enlightened turks devoutly believe historical story jonah.

 voyages, speaks turkish mosque built honor jonah, which
 mosque miraculous lamp burnt without oil.
 

chapter 84. pitchpoling.
 
make run easily swiftly, axles carriages are
 anointed; much purpose, whalers perform an
 analogous operation upon boat; grease bottom. it
 doubted procedure can harm, may possibly
 contemptible advantage; considering oil water are
 hostile; oil sliding thing, object view to
 make boat slide bravely. queequeg believed strongly anointing
 boat, one morning long german ship jungfrau
 disappeared, took customary pains occupation;
 crawling bottom, hung side, rubbing in
 unctuousness though diligently seeking insure crop hair
 craft’s bald keel. seemed working obedience to
 particular presentiment. remain unwarranted the
 event.
 
towards noon whales raised; soon ship sailed to
 them, turned fled swift precipitancy; disordered
 flight, cleopatra’s barges actium.
 
nevertheless, boats pursued, stubb’s foremost. great
 exertion, tashtego last succeeded planting one iron; the
 stricken whale, without sounding, still continued horizontal
 flight, added fleetness. unintermitted strainings upon the
 planted iron must sooner later inevitably extract it. became
 imperative lance flying whale, content lose him. to
 haul boat flank impossible, swam fast and
 furious. remained?
 
wondrous devices dexterities, sleights hand and
 countless subtleties, veteran whaleman often forced,
 none exceed fine manœuvre lance called pitchpoling. small
 sword, broad sword, exercises boasts nothing like it. it
 indispensable inveterate running whale; grand fact
 feature wonderful distance long lance is
 accurately darted violently rocking, jerking boat, extreme
 headway. steel wood included, entire spear ten or
 twelve feet length; staff much slighter the
 harpoon, also lighter material—pine. furnished a
 small rope called warp, considerable length, can be
 hauled back hand darting.
 
going further, important mention here, though
 harpoon may pitchpoled way lance, yet is
 seldom done; done, still less frequently successful, on
 account greater weight inferior length harpoon as
 compared lance, effect become serious drawbacks. a
 general thing, therefore, must first get fast whale, before
 pitchpoling comes play.
 
look now stubb; man humorous, deliberate coolness and
 equanimity direst emergencies, specially qualified excel
 pitchpoling. look him; stands upright tossed bow the
 flying boat; wrapt fleecy foam, towing whale forty feet
 ahead. handling long lance lightly, glancing twice thrice along
 length see exactly straight, stubb whistlingly gathers
 coil warp one hand, secure free end in
 grasp, leaving rest unobstructed. holding lance full
 waistband’s middle, levels whale; when,
 covering it, steadily depresses butt-end hand,
 thereby elevating point till weapon stands fairly balanced upon
 palm, fifteen feet air. minds somewhat juggler,
 balancing long staff chin. next moment rapid, nameless
 impulse, superb lofty arch bright steel spans foaming
 distance, quivers life spot whale. instead of
 sparkling water, now spouts red blood.
 
“that drove spigot him!” cried stubb. “’tis july’s immortal
 fourth; fountains must run wine today! now, old
 orleans whiskey, old ohio, unspeakable old monongahela! then,
 tashtego, lad, i’d ye hold canakin jet, we’d drink
 round it! yea, verily, hearts alive, we’d brew choice punch the
 spread spout-hole there, live punch-bowl quaff the
 living stuff.”
 
gamesome talk, dexterous dart repeated,
 spear returning master like greyhound held skilful
 leash. agonized whale goes flurry; tow-line is
 slackened, pitchpoler dropping astern, folds hands, and
 mutely watches monster die.
 

chapter 85. fountain.
 
six thousand years—and one knows many millions ages
 before—the great whales spouting sea, and
 sprinkling mistifying gardens deep, many
 sprinkling mistifying pots; centuries back,
 thousands hunters close fountain the
 whale, watching sprinklings spoutings—that should
 be, yet, blessed minute (fifteen quarter
 minutes past one o’clock p.m. sixteenth day december, a.d.
 1851), still remain problem, whether spoutings are,
 all, really water, nothing vapor—this surely a
 noteworthy thing.
 
let us, then, look matter, along interesting items
 contingent. every one knows peculiar cunning their
 gills, finny tribes general breathe air times
 combined element swim; hence, herring a
 cod might live century, never raise head the
 surface. owing marked internal structure gives him
 regular lungs, like human being’s, whale can live by
 inhaling disengaged air open atmosphere. wherefore the
 necessity periodical visits upper world. cannot
 degree breathe mouth, for, ordinary attitude,
 sperm whale’s mouth buried least eight feet beneath the
 surface; still more, windpipe connexion his
 mouth. no, breathes spiracle alone; the

 assume it, follows blood man be
 aerated one breath, might seal nostrils not

 live without breathing. anomalous may seem, precisely the
 case whale, systematically lives, intervals, full
 hour (when bottom) without drawing single breath, or
 much way inhaling particle air; for, remember, has
 gills. this? ribs side spine

 inexplicable obstinacy leviathan _having spoutings out_,
 fishermen phrase it. mean. unmolested, upon
 rising surface, sperm whale will continue period
 time exactly uniform unmolested risings. say he
 stays eleven minutes, jets seventy times, is, respires seventy
 breaths; whenever rises again, will sure his
 seventy breaths again, minute. now, fetches few

 seventy breaths told, will finally go stay full

 thus insist upon spoutings out, unless replenish
 reservoir air, ere descending good? obvious it, too,
 necessity whale’s rising exposes fatal
 hazards chase. hook net vast
 leviathan caught, sailing thousand fathoms beneath the
 sunlight. much thy skill, then, hunter, great
 necessities strike victory thee!
 
man, breathing incessantly going on—one breath serving for
 two three pulsations; whatever business to
 attend to, waking sleeping, breathe must, die will. the
 sperm whale breathes one seventh sunday time.
 
said whale breathes spout-hole;
 truthfully added spouts mixed water,
 opine furnished reason sense of
 smell seems obliterated him; thing at
 answers nose identical spout-hole; so
 clogged two elements, expected power
 smelling. owing mystery spout—whether water
 whether vapor—no absolute certainty can yet arrived at
 head. sure is, nevertheless, sperm whale no
 proper olfactories. want them? roses, no
 violets, cologne-water sea.
 
furthermore, windpipe solely opens tube spouting
 canal, long canal—like grand erie canal—is furnished
 sort locks (that open shut) downward retention of
 air upward exclusion water, therefore whale voice;
 unless insult saying, strangely rumbles, he
 talks nose. again, whale say?
 seldom known profound anything say this
 world, unless forced stammer something way getting a
 living. oh! happy world excellent listener!
 
now, spouting canal sperm whale, chiefly intended is
 conveyance air, several feet laid along,
 horizontally, just beneath upper surface head, little
 one side; curious canal much like gas-pipe laid down
 city one side street. question returns whether
 gas-pipe also water-pipe; words, whether spout
 sperm whale mere vapor exhaled breath, whether
 exhaled breath mixed water taken mouth, and
 discharged spiracle. certain mouth
 indirectly communicates spouting canal; be
 proved purpose discharging water the
 spiracle. greatest necessity seem be,
 feeding accidentally takes water. sperm whale’s
 food far beneath surface, spout even he
 would. besides, regard closely, time your
 watch, will find unmolested, undeviating
 rhyme periods jets ordinary periods of
 respiration.
 
pester one reasoning subject? speak out!
 seen spout; declare spout is; can not
 tell water air? dear sir, world easy to
 settle plain things. ever found plain things the
 knottiest all. whale spout, might almost stand
 it, yet undecided precisely.
 
central body hidden snowy sparkling mist enveloping
 it; can certainly tell whether water falls it,
 when, always, close enough whale get close view

 even tranquilly swimming mid-day calm, with
 elevated hump sun-dried dromedary’s desert; even then,
 whale always carries small basin water head, a
 blazing sun will sometimes see cavity rock filled with
 rain.
 
prudent hunter curious touching the
 precise nature whale spout. will peering

 slight contact outer, vapory shreds jet, will
 often happen, skin will feverishly smart, acridness of
 thing touching it. know one, coming still closer
 contact spout, whether scientific object view, or
 otherwise, say, skin peeled cheek arm.
 wherefore, among whalemen, spout deemed poisonous; try to
 evade it. another thing; heard said, much doubt
 it, jet fairly spouted eyes, will blind
 you. wisest thing investigator can then, seems me, is
 let deadly spout alone.

chapter 86. tail.
 
poets warbled praises soft eye antelope,
 lovely plumage bird never alights; less celestial,
 celebrate tail.
 
reckoning largest sized sperm whale’s tail begin point

 compact round body root expands two broad, firm, flat
 palms flukes, gradually shoaling away less inch in

 fairy’s arm can transcend it.
 
five great motions peculiar it. first, used for
 progression; second, used mace battle; third, sweeping;
 fourth, lobtailing; fifth, peaking flukes.
 
first: horizontal position, leviathan’s tail acts a
 different manner tails creatures. never

 whale, tail sole means propulsion. scroll-wise coiled

second: little significant, one sperm whale only
 fights another sperm whale head jaw, nevertheless, his
 conflicts man, chiefly contemptuously uses tail. in

 blow inflicted recoil. made unobstructed

third: demonstrate it, seems me, whale

fourth: stealing unawares upon whale fancied security the

 sperm whale presents thick curled bush white mist, continually

seen pequod’s deck, then, rise high hill of

 like thousand cheerful chimneys dense metropolis, descried

marching armies approaching unfriendly defile mountains,
 accelerate march, eagerness place perilous passage in
 rear, expand comparative security upon the
 plain; even vast fleet whales now seem hurrying forward

 semicircle, swimming on, one solid, still crescentic centre.
 
crowding sail pequod pressed them; harpooneers
 handling weapons, loudly cheering heads yet
 suspended boats. wind held, little doubt they, that
 chased straits sunda, vast host deploy

 harpooneers seemed grieve swift whales been

 keels them,—though yet mile rear,—than
 rallied again, forming close ranks battalions, that
 spouts looked like flashing lines stacked bayonets, moved

stripped shirts drawers, sprang white-ash, and
 several hours’ pulling almost disposed renounce the
 chase, general pausing commotion among whales gave animating
 token now last influence strange
 perplexity inert irresolution, which, fishermen perceive it
 whale, say gallied. compact martial columns in
 hitherto rapidly steadily swimming, now
 broken one measureless rout; like king porus’ elephants in
 indian battle alexander, seemed going mad with
 consternation. directions expanding vast irregular circles,
 aimlessly swimming hither thither, short thick
 spoutings, plainly betrayed distraction panic. was

 paralysed were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled

though many whales, said, violent motion,

 many minor contingencies, partaking one grand feature. for
 example,—after weary perilous chase capture whale, the
 body may get loose ship reason violent storm; and
 drifting far away leeward, retaken second whaler, who, a
 calm, snugly tows alongside, without risk life line. thus the
 vexatious violent disputes often arise the
 fishermen, written unwritten, universal,

first: fast-fish? alive dead fish technically fast,

 same. likewise fish technically fast bears waif, any

 plainly evince ability time take alongside, well

scientific commentaries; commentaries whalemen
 sometimes consist hard words harder knocks—the
 coke-upon-littleton fist. true, among upright and
 honorable whalemen allowances always made peculiar cases, where
 outrageous moral injustice one party claim
 possession whale previously chased killed another party. but
 others means scrupulous.
 
fifty years ago curious case whale-trover litigated
 england, wherein plaintiffs set forth hard chase of
 whale northern seas; indeed (the plaintiffs) had
 succeeded harpooning fish; last, peril of
 lives, obliged forsake lines, boat
 itself. ultimately defendants (the crew another ship) came up
 whale, struck, killed, seized, finally appropriated it
 eyes plaintiffs. defendants were
 remonstrated with, captain snapped fingers plaintiffs’
 teeth, assured way doxology deed had
 done, now retain line, harpoons, boat, had
 remained attached whale time seizure. wherefore
 plaintiffs now sued recovery value whale,
 line, harpoons, boat.

 supported saying, though gentleman originally

 great stress plunging viciousness, last abandoned

 therefore subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, lady then
 became subsequent gentleman’s property, along whatever
 harpoon might found sticking her.
 
now present case erskine contended examples the
 whale lady reciprocally illustrative other.
 
pleadings, counter pleadings, duly heard, very

 awarded plaintiffs, merely abandoned to

 harpoons, line, belonged defendants; whale, because
 loose-fish time final capture; harpoons
 line fish made them, (the fish)
 acquired property articles; hence anybody afterwards
 took fish right them. now defendants afterwards took
 fish; ergo, aforesaid articles theirs.
 
common man looking decision learned judge, might
 possibly object it. ploughed primary rock the

 cited case; two laws touching fast-fish loose-fish,
 say, will, reflection, found fundamentals human

chapter 91. pequod meets rose-bud.
 
“in vain rake ambergriese paunch this
 leviathan, insufferable fetor denying inquiry.” _sir t. browne,
 v.e._
 
week two last whaling scene recounted, when
 slowly sailing sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, the
 many noses pequod’s deck proved vigilant discoverers than
 three pairs eyes aloft. peculiar pleasant smell
 smelt sea.
 
“i will bet something now,” said stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are
 drugged whales tickled day. thought they
 keel long.”
 
presently, vapors advance slid aside; distance
 lay ship, whose furled sails betokened sort whale must
 alongside. glided nearer, stranger showed french colours
 peak; eddying cloud vulture sea-fowl that
 circled, hovered, swooped around him, plain the
 whale alongside must fishermen call blasted whale, that
 is, whale died unmolested sea, floated an
 unappropriated corpse. may well conceived, unsavory odor
 mass must exhale; worse assyrian city plague,
 living incompetent bury departed. intolerable
 indeed regarded some, cupidity persuade to
 moor alongside it. yet will still it;
 notwithstanding fact oil obtained subjects of
 inferior quality, means nature of
 attar-of-rose.
 
coming still nearer expiring breeze, saw frenchman
 second whale alongside; second whale seemed even of
 nosegay first. truth, turned one those
 problematical whales seem dry die sort of
 prodigious dyspepsia, indigestion; leaving defunct bodies
 almost entirely bankrupt anything like oil. nevertheless, the
 proper place shall see knowing fisherman will ever turn up
 nose whale this, however much may shun blasted
 whales general.
 
pequod now swept nigh stranger, stubb vowed he
 recognised cutting spade-pole entangled lines were
 knotted round tail one whales.
 
“there’s pretty fellow, now,” banteringly laughed, standing the
 ship’s bows, “there’s jackal ye! well know crappoes

 he’ll get bundle bones; though, now think of
 it, may contain something worth good deal oil; yes,
 ambergris. wonder now old man thought that. it’s worth
 trying. yes, i’m it;” saying started the
 quarter-deck.
 
time faint air become complete calm; whether
 no, pequod now fairly entrapped smell, hope
 escaping except breezing again. issuing cabin,
 stubb now called boat’s crew, pulled stranger.
 drawing across bow, perceived accordance the
 fanciful french taste, upper part stem-piece carved in

 thorns copper spikes projecting there; whole
 terminating symmetrical folded bulb bright red colour. upon
 head boards, large gilt letters, read “bouton de
 rose,”—rose-button, rose-bud; romantic name this
 aromatic ship.
 
though stubb understand _bouton_ part inscription,
 yet word _rose_, bulbous figure-head put together,
 sufficiently explained whole him.
 
“a wooden rose-bud, eh?” cried hand nose, “that will
 well; like creation smells!”
 
now order hold direct communication people deck, he
 pull round bows starboard side, thus come close

arrived spot, one hand still nose, he
 bawled—“bouton-de-rose, ahoy! bouton-de-roses that
 speak english?”
 
“yes,” rejoined guernsey-man bulwarks, turned be
 chief-mate.
 
“well, then, bouton-de-rose-bud, seen white whale?”
 
“_what_ whale?”
 
“the _white_ whale—a sperm whale—moby dick, ye seen him?
 
“never heard whale. cachalot blanche! white whale—no.”
 
“very good, then; good bye now, i’ll call minute.”
 
rapidly pulling back towards pequod, seeing ahab leaning
 quarter-deck rail awaiting report, moulded two
 hands trumpet shouted—“no, sir! no!” upon ahab
 retired, stubb returned frenchman.
 
now perceived guernsey-man, just got the
 chains, using cutting-spade, slung nose sort of
 bag.
 
“what’s matter nose, there?” said stubb. “broke it?”
 
“i wish broken, didn’t nose all!” answered
 guernsey-man, seem relish job very
 much. “but holding _yours_ for?”
 
“oh, nothing! it’s wax nose; hold on. fine day, ain’t
 it? air rather gardenny, say; throw us bunch posies, will
 ye, bouton-de-rose?”
 
“what devil’s name want here?” roared guernseyman,
 flying sudden passion.
 
“oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s word! don’t pack those
 whales ice you’re working ’em? joking aside, though; do
 know, rose-bud, it’s nonsense trying get oil of
 whales? dried one, there, hasn’t gill his
 whole carcase.”
 
“i know well enough; but, d’ye see, captain won’t believe
 it; first voyage; cologne manufacturer before. but
 come aboard, mayhap he’ll believe you, won’t me; i’ll
 get dirty scrape.”
 
“anything oblige ye, sweet pleasant fellow,” rejoined stubb,
 soon mounted deck. queer scene
 presented itself. sailors, tasselled caps red worsted, were
 getting heavy tackles readiness whales. worked
 rather slow talked fast, seemed anything good
 humor. noses upwardly projected faces like many
 jib-booms. now pairs drop work, run up
 mast-head get fresh air. thinking catch
 plague, dipped oakum coal-tar, intervals held their
 nostrils. others broken stems pipes almost short
 bowl, vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, it
 constantly filled olfactories.
 
stubb struck shower outcries anathemas proceeding from
 captain’s round-house abaft; looking direction saw a
 fiery face thrust behind door, held ajar from
 within. tormented surgeon, who, vain
 remonstrating proceedings day, betaken himself
 captain’s round-house (_cabinet_ called it) avoid the
 pest; still, help yelling entreaties and
 indignations times.
 
marking this, stubb argued well scheme, turning the
 guernsey-man little chat him, stranger mate
 expressed detestation captain conceited ignoramus, who
 brought unsavory unprofitable pickle.
 sounding carefully, stubb perceived guernsey-man
 slightest suspicion concerning ambergris. therefore
 held peace head, otherwise quite frank and
 confidential him, two quickly concocted little plan
 circumventing satirizing captain, without all
 dreaming distrusting sincerity. according little plan
 theirs, guernsey-man, cover interpreter’s office,
 tell captain pleased, coming stubb; and
 stubb, utter nonsense come uppermost
 interview.
 
time destined victim appeared cabin. a
 small dark, rather delicate looking man sea-captain, with
 large whiskers moustache, however; wore red cotton velvet
 vest watch-seals side. gentleman, stubb now
 politely introduced guernsey-man, ostentatiously put
 aspect interpreting them.
 
“what shall say first?” said he.
 
“why,” said stubb, eyeing velvet vest watch seals, “you
 may well begin telling looks sort babyish me,
 though don’t pretend judge.”
 
“he says, monsieur,” said guernsey-man, french, turning his
 captain, “that yesterday ship spoke vessel, whose captain
 chief-mate, six sailors, died fever caught a
 blasted whale brought alongside.”
 
upon captain started, eagerly desired know more.
 
“what now?” said guernsey-man stubb.
 
“why, since takes easy, tell now eyed him
 carefully, i’m quite certain he’s fit command a
 whale-ship st. jago monkey. fact, tell he’s a
 baboon.”
 
“he vows declares, monsieur, whale, dried one,
 far deadly blasted one; fine, monsieur, conjures
 us, value lives, cut loose fish.”
 
instantly captain ran forward, loud voice commanded his
 crew desist hoisting cutting-tackles, cast
 loose cables chains confining whales ship.
 
“what now?” said guernsey-man, captain returned to
 them.
 
“why, let see; yes, may well tell now that—that—in fact,
 tell i’ve diddled him, (aside himself) perhaps somebody
 else.”
 
“he says, monsieur, he’s happy service to
 us.”
 
hearing this, captain vowed grateful parties
 (meaning mate) concluded inviting stubb into
 cabin drink bottle bordeaux.
 
“he wants take glass wine him,” said interpreter.
 
“thank heartily; tell it’s principles drink

“he says, monsieur, principles won’t admit drinking;
 monsieur wants live another day drink, monsieur
 best drop four boats, pull ship away whales,
 it’s calm won’t drift.”
 
time stubb side, getting boat, hailed
 guernsey-man effect,—that long tow-line his
 boat, help them, pulling the
 lighter whale two ship’s side. frenchman’s
 boats, then, engaged towing ship one way, stubb
 benevolently towed away whale way, ostentatiously
 slacking unusually long tow-line.
 
presently breeze sprang up; stubb feigned cast whale;
 hoisting boats, frenchman soon increased distance, while
 pequod slid stubb’s whale. whereupon stubb
 quickly pulled floating body, hailing pequod give
 notice intentions, proceeded reap fruit his
 unrighteous cunning. seizing sharp boat-spade, commenced an
 excavation body, little behind side fin. almost
 thought digging cellar sea; at
 length spade struck gaunt ribs, like turning up
 old roman tiles pottery buried fat english loam. boat’s crew
 high excitement, eagerly helping chief, looking
 anxious gold-hunters.
 
time numberless fowls diving, ducking, and
 screaming, yelling, fighting around them. stubb beginning
 look disappointed, especially horrible nosegay increased,
 suddenly heart plague, stole a
 faint stream perfume, flowed tide bad smells
 without absorbed it, one river will flow then
 along another, without blending time.
 
“i it, it,” cried stubb, delight, striking something
 subterranean regions, “a purse! purse!”
 
dropping spade, thrust hands in, drew handfuls of
 something looked like ripe windsor soap, rich mottled old
 cheese; unctuous savory withal. might easily dent with
 thumb; hue yellow ash colour. this,
 good friends, ambergris, worth gold guinea ounce any
 druggist. six handfuls obtained; unavoidably
 lost sea, still more, perhaps, might secured were
 impatient ahab’s loud command stubb desist, come

chapter 92. ambergris.
 
now ambergris curious substance, important an
 article commerce, 1791 certain nantucket-born captain
 coffin examined bar english house commons that
 subject. time, indeed comparatively late day,
 precise origin ambergris remained, like amber itself, problem
 learned. though word ambergris french compound
 grey amber, yet two substances quite distinct. amber,
 though times found sea-coast, also dug far
 inland soils, whereas ambergris never found except upon sea.
 besides, amber hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,
 used mouth-pieces pipes, beads ornaments; ambergris
 soft, waxy, highly fragrant spicy, largely
 used perfumery, pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and
 pomatum. turks use cooking, also carry mecca, for
 purpose frankincense carried st. peter’s rome.
 wine merchants drop grains claret, flavor it.
 
think, then, fine ladies gentlemen should
 regale essence found inglorious bowels a
 sick whale! yet is. some, ambergris supposed the
 cause, others effect, dyspepsia whale. to
 cure dyspepsia hard say, unless administering
 three four boat loads brandreth’s pills, running of
 harm’s way, laborers blasting rocks.
 
forgotten say found ambergris,

 sown dishonor, raised glory. likewise
 call mind saying paracelsus maketh the
 best musk. also forget strange fact things of

 worst.
 
like conclude chapter appeal, but
 cannot, owing anxiety repel charge often made against
 whalemen, which, estimation already biased minds,
 might considered indirectly substantiated said
 frenchman’s two whales. elsewhere volume slanderous
 aspersion disproved, vocation whaling is
 throughout slatternly, untidy business. another thing to
 rebut. hint whales always smell bad. now this
 odious stigma originate?
 
opine, plainly traceable first arrival the
 greenland whaling ships london, two centuries ago. because
 whalemen then, now, try oil sea
 southern ships always done; cutting fresh
 blubber small bits, thrust bung holes large casks,
 carry home manner; shortness season those

 forbidding course. consequence is, upon breaking

partly surmise also, wicked charge whalers may be
 likewise imputed existence coast greenland, former

 quite different south sperm whaler; a

 truth is, living dead, decently treated, whales a

chapter 93. castaway.
 
days encountering frenchman, most
 significant event befell insignificant pequod’s crew;
 event lamentable; ended providing sometimes
 madly merry predestinated craft living ever accompanying
 prophecy whatever shattered sequel might prove own.
 
now, whale ship, every one goes boats.

 timorous wight ship, wight certain made a
 ship-keeper. pequod little negro pippin by
 nick-name, pip abbreviation. poor pip! ye heard before;
 ye must remember tambourine dramatic midnight, so
 gloomy-jolly.
 
outer aspect, pip dough-boy made match, like black pony and
 white one, equal developments, though dissimilar colour, driven
 one eccentric span. hapless dough-boy nature dull
 torpid intellects, pip, though tender-hearted, at
 bottom bright, pleasant, genial, jolly brightness

 festivities finer, freer relish race. blacks,
 year’s calendar show naught three hundred sixty-five

 little black brilliant, even blackness brilliancy;
 behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled king’s cabinets. pip loved
 life, life’s peaceable securities; panic-striking
 business somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had
 sadly blurred brightness; though, ere long will seen,
 thus temporarily subdued him, end destined be
 luridly illumined strange wild fires, fictitiously showed him
 ten times natural lustre native tolland

 clear air day, suspended blue-veined neck, the
 pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, cunning
 jeweller show diamond impressive lustre, he
 lays gloomy ground, lights up, sun,
 unnatural gases. come fiery effulgences,
 infernally superb; evil-blazing diamond, divinest
 symbol crystal skies, looks like crown-jewel stolen from
 king hell. let us story.
 
came pass, ambergris affair stubb’s after-oarsman
 chanced sprain hand, time become quite maimed;
 and, temporarily, pip put place.
 
first time stubb lowered him, pip evinced much nervousness;
 happily, time, escaped close contact whale; and
 therefore came altogether discreditably; though stubb observing
 him, took care, afterwards, exhort cherish courageousness
 utmost, might often find needful.
 
now upon second lowering, boat paddled upon whale; as
 fish received darted iron, gave customary rap, which
 happened, instance, right poor pip’s seat. the
 involuntary consternation moment caused leap, paddle in
 hand, boat; way, part slack whale
 line coming chest, breasted overboard him, as
 become entangled it, last plumping water. that
 instant stricken whale started fierce run, line swiftly
 straightened; presto! poor pip came foaming chocks of
 boat, remorselessly dragged line, taken
 several turns around chest neck.
 
tashtego stood bows. full fire hunt. he
 hated pip poltroon. snatching boat-knife sheath, he
 suspended sharp edge line, turning towards stubb,
 exclaimed interrogatively, “cut?” meantime pip’s blue, choked face
 plainly looked, do, god’s sake! passed flash. less than
 half minute, entire thing happened.
 
“damn him, cut!” roared stubb; whale lost pip was
 saved.
 
soon recovered himself, poor little negro assailed by
 yells execrations crew. tranquilly permitting these
 irregular cursings evaporate, stubb plain, business-like,
 still half humorous manner, cursed pip officially; done,
 unofficially gave much wholesome advice. substance was, never
 jump boat, pip, except—but rest indefinite, the
 soundest advice ever is. now, general, _stick boat_, your
 true motto whaling; cases will sometimes happen _leap from
 boat_, still better. moreover, perceiving last if
 give undiluted conscientious advice pip, be
 leaving wide margin jump future; stubb suddenly
 dropped advice, concluded peremptory command, “stick to
 boat, pip, lord, won’t pick jump; mind
 that. can’t afford lose whales likes you; whale would
 sell thirty times would, pip, alabama. bear in
 mind, don’t jump more.” hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted,
 though man loved fellow, yet man money-making animal,
 propensity often interferes benevolence.
 
hands gods; pip jumped again. was
 similar circumstances first performance; this
 time breast line; hence, whale started
 run, pip left behind sea, like hurried traveller’s
 trunk. alas! stubb true word. beautiful,
 bounteous, blue day; spangled calm cool, flatly
 stretching away, round, horizon, like gold-beater’s skin
 hammered extremest. bobbing sea, pip’s
 ebon head showed like head cloves. boat-knife lifted when
 fell rapidly astern. stubb’s inexorable back turned upon him;
 whale winged. three minutes, whole mile shoreless
 ocean pip stubb. centre sea, poor
 pip turned crisp, curling, black head sun, another lonely
 castaway, though loftiest brightest.
 
now, calm weather, swim open ocean easy the
 practised swimmer ride spring-carriage ashore. awful
 lonesomeness intolerable. intense concentration self the
 middle heartless immensity, god! can tell it? mark,
 sailors dead calm bathe open sea—mark closely
 hug ship coast along sides.
 
stubb really abandoned poor little negro fate? no;
 mean to, least. two boats wake,
 supposed, doubt, course come pip
 quickly, pick up; though, indeed, considerations
 towards oarsmen jeopardized timidity, always
 manifested hunters similar instances; instances
 unfrequently occur; almost invariably fishery, coward, so
 called, marked ruthless detestation peculiar to
 military navies armies.
 
happened, boats, without seeing pip, suddenly
 spying whales close one side, turned, gave chase; and
 stubb’s boat now far away, crew intent
 upon fish, pip’s ringed horizon began expand around him
 miserably. merest chance ship last rescued him;
 hour little negro went deck idiot; such,
 least, said was. jeeringly kept finite body
 up, drowned infinite soul. drowned entirely, though.
 rather carried alive wondrous depths, strange shapes of
 unwarped primal world glided fro passive eyes;
 miser-merman, wisdom, revealed hoarded heaps; among the
 joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, pip saw multitudinous,
 god-omnipresent, coral insects, firmament waters

keep squeezing sperm ever! now, since

chapter 95. cassock.
 
stepped board pequod certain juncture this
 post-mortemizing whale; strolled forward nigh the
 windlass, pretty sure scanned small
 curiosity strange, enigmatical object, seen
 there, lying along lengthwise lee scuppers. wondrous
 cistern whale’s huge head; prodigy unhinged lower
 jaw; miracle symmetrical tail; none so
 surprise you, half glimpse unaccountable cone,—longer than
 kentuckian tall, nigh foot diameter base, and
 jet-black yojo, ebony idol queequeg. idol, indeed, it

chapter 96. try-works.
 
besides hoisted boats, american whaler outwardly
 distinguished try-works. presents curious anomaly the
 solid masonry joining oak hemp constituting the
 completed ship. open field brick-kiln were
 transported planks.
 
try-works planted foremast mainmast, most
 roomy part deck. timbers beneath peculiar strength,
 fitted sustain weight almost solid mass brick and
 mortar, ten feet eight square, five height. the
 foundation penetrate deck, masonry firmly
 secured surface ponderous knees iron bracing all
 sides, screwing timbers. flanks cased
 wood, top completely covered large, sloping, battened
 hatchway. removing hatch expose great try-pots, two in
 number, several barrels’ capacity. use, they
 kept remarkably clean. sometimes polished soapstone
 sand, till shine within like silver punch-bowls. the
 night-watches cynical old sailors will crawl coil

 man pot, side side—many confidential communications are
 carried on, iron lips. place also profound
 mathematical meditation. left hand try-pot pequod,
 soapstone diligently circling round me, first

 communicating deck, means shallow reservoir
 extending entire inclosed surface works. tunnel
 inserted rear, reservoir kept replenished water as
 fast evaporates. external chimneys; open direct
 rear wall. let us go back moment.
 
nine o’clock night pequod’s try-works were
 first started present voyage. belonged stubb oversee
 business.
 
“all ready there? hatch, then, start her. cook, fire the
 works.” easy thing, carpenter thrusting
 shavings furnace throughout passage. said
 whaling voyage first fire try-works fed
 time wood. wood used, except means of
 quick ignition staple fuel. word, tried out,
 crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps fritters, still
 contains considerable unctuous properties. fritters feed
 flames. like plethoric burning martyr, self-consuming
 misanthrope, ignited, whale supplies fuel burns by
 body. consumed smoke! smoke is
 horrible inhale, inhale must, that, you
 must live time. unspeakable, wild, hindoo odor
 it, may lurk vicinity funereal pyres. smells
 like left wing day judgment; argument the
 pit.
 
midnight works full operation. clear the
 carcase; sail made; wind freshening; wild ocean
 darkness intense. darkness licked fierce
 flames, intervals forked forth sooty flues, and
 illuminated every lofty rope rigging, famed greek
 fire. burning ship drove on, remorselessly commissioned to
 vengeful deed. pitch sulphur-freighted brigs the
 bold hydriote, canaris, issuing midnight harbors, broad
 sheets flame sails, bore upon turkish frigates, and
 folded conflagrations.
 
hatch, removed top works, now afforded wide
 hearth front them. standing tartarean shapes of
 pagan harpooneers, always whale-ship’s stokers. huge
 pronged poles pitched hissing masses blubber scalding
 pots, stirred fires beneath, till snaky flames darted,
 curling, doors catch feet. smoke rolled
 away sullen heaps. every pitch ship pitch of
 boiling oil, seemed eagerness leap faces.
 opposite mouth works, side wide wooden
 hearth, windlass. served sea-sofa. lounged the
 watch, otherwise employed, looking red heat the
 fire, till eyes felt scorched heads. tawny
 features, now begrimed smoke sweat, matted beards,
 contrasting barbaric brilliancy teeth, were
 strangely revealed capricious emblazonings works. they
 narrated unholy adventures, tales terror
 told words mirth; uncivilized laughter forked upwards
 them, like flames furnace; fro, their
 front, harpooneers wildly gesticulated huge pronged
 forks dippers; wind howled on, leaped, the
 ship groaned dived, yet steadfastly shot red hell further
 blackness night, scornfully
 champed white bone mouth, viciously spat round on
 sides; rushing pequod, freighted savages, laden
 fire, burning corpse, plunging blackness of
 darkness, seemed material counterpart monomaniac commander’s
 soul.
 
seemed me, stood helm, long hours silently
 guided way fire-ship sea. wrapped, that
 interval, darkness myself, better saw redness, the
 madness, ghastliness others. continual sight fiend
 shapes me, capering half smoke half fire, at
 last begat kindred visions soul, soon began yield to
 unaccountable drowsiness ever come a
 midnight helm.
 
night, particular, strange (and ever since inexplicable)
 thing occurred me. starting brief standing sleep, was
 horribly conscious something fatally wrong. jaw-bone tiller
 smote side, leaned it; ears low hum of
 sails, just beginning shake wind; thought eyes were
 open; half conscious putting fingers lids and
 mechanically stretching still apart. but, spite all
 this, see compass steer by; though seemed
 minute since watching card, steady binnacle
 lamp illuminating it. nothing seemed jet gloom, now and
 made ghastly flashes redness. uppermost impression,
 whatever swift, rushing thing stood much bound to
 haven ahead rushing havens astern. stark, bewildered
 feeling, death, came me. convulsively hands grasped the
 tiller, crazy conceit tiller was, somehow, in
 enchanted way, inverted. god! matter me?
 thought i. lo! brief sleep turned about, was
 fronting ship’s stern, back prow compass. in
 instant faced back, just time prevent vessel flying
 wind, probably capsizing her. glad how
 grateful relief unnatural hallucination night, and
 fatal contingency brought lee!
 
look long face fire, man! never dream thy
 hand helm! turn thy back compass; accept first
 hint hitching tiller; believe artificial fire, its
 redness makes things look ghastly. to-morrow, natural sun,
 skies will bright; glared like devils forking
 flames, morn will show far other, least gentler, relief; the
 glorious, golden, glad sun, true lamp—all others liars!
 
nevertheless sun hides virginia’s dismal swamp, rome’s
 accursed campagna, wide sahara, millions miles of
 deserts griefs beneath moon. sun hides ocean,
 dark side earth, two thirds this
 earth. so, therefore, mortal man hath joy sorrow
 him, mortal man true—not true, undeveloped. with
 books same. truest men man sorrows, the
 truest books solomon’s, ecclesiastes fine hammered
 steel woe. “all vanity.” all. wilful world hath got hold
 unchristian solomon’s wisdom yet. dodges hospitals and
 jails, walks fast crossing graveyards, rather talk of
 operas hell; calls cowper, young, pascal, rousseau, poor devils
 sick men; throughout care-free lifetime swears rabelais
 passing wise, therefore jolly;—not man fitted sit
 tomb-stones, break green damp mould unfathomably
 wondrous solomon.
 
even solomon, says, “the man wandereth way of
 understanding shall remain” (_i.e._, even living) “in the
 congregation dead.” give thyself up, then, fire, lest it
 invert thee, deaden thee; time me. wisdom
 woe; woe madness. a
 catskill eagle souls can alike dive blackest
 gorges, soar become invisible sunny
 spaces. even ever flies within gorge, gorge is
 mountains; even lowest swoop mountain eagle
 still higher birds upon plain, even though soar.
 

chapter 97. lamp.
 
descended pequod’s try-works pequod’s
 forecastle, duty watch sleeping, one single
 moment almost thought standing some
 illuminated shrine canonized kings counsellors. lay
 triangular oaken vaults, mariner chiselled muteness; a
 score lamps flashing upon hooded eyes.
 
merchantmen, oil sailor scarce milk of
 queens. dress dark, eat dark, stumble in
 darkness pallet, usual lot. whaleman, he
 seeks food light, lives light. makes berth an
 aladdin’s lamp, lays it; pitchiest night
 ship’s black hull still houses illumination.
 
see entire freedom whaleman takes handful of
 lamps—often old bottles vials, though—to copper cooler at
 try-works, replenishes there, mugs ale vat. he
 burns, too, purest oil, unmanufactured, and, therefore,
 unvitiated state; fluid unknown solar, lunar, astral
 contrivances ashore. sweet early grass butter april. he
 goes hunts oil, sure freshness and
 genuineness, even traveller prairie hunts own
 supper game.
 

chapter 98. stowing clearing up.
 
already related great leviathan afar off
 descried mast-head; chased watery moors,
 slaughtered valleys deep; towed
 alongside beheaded; (on principle entitled the
 headsman old garments beheaded killed) his
 great padded surtout becomes property executioner; how, in
 due time, condemned pots, and, like shadrach, meshach, and
 abednego, spermaceti, oil, bone pass unscathed the

 description rehearsing—singing, may—the romantic proceeding
 decanting oil casks striking the
 hold, leviathan returns native profundities,
 sliding along beneath surface before; but, alas! never to
 rise blow.
 
still warm, oil, like hot punch, received the
 six-barrel casks; while, perhaps, ship pitching rolling
 way midnight sea, enormous casks slewed
 round headed over, end end, sometimes perilously scoot
 across slippery deck, like many land slides, till last
 man-handled stayed course; round hoops, rap,
 rap, go many hammers can play upon them, now, _ex officio_,
 every sailor cooper.
 
length, last pint casked, cool, the
 great hatchways unsealed, bowels ship thrown open,
 go casks final rest sea. done, the
 hatches replaced, hermetically closed, like closet walled up.
 
sperm fishery, perhaps one remarkable

 freshets blood oil; sacred quarter-deck enormous
 masses whale’s head profanely piled; great rusty casks lie
 about, brewery yard; smoke try-works besooted
 bulwarks; mariners go suffused unctuousness; the
 entire ship seems great leviathan himself; hands din
 deafening.
 
day two after, look you, prick ears this
 self-same ship; tell-tale boats try-works,
 swear trod silent merchant vessel, a
 scrupulously neat commander. unmanufactured sperm oil
 possesses singularly cleansing virtue. reason the
 decks never look white just call affair of
 oil. besides, ashes burned scraps whale, a
 potent lye readily made; whenever adhesiveness back
 whale remains clinging side, lye quickly
 exterminates it. hands go diligently along bulwarks, with
 buckets water rags restore full tidiness. soot
 brushed lower rigging. numerous implements which
 use likewise faithfully cleansed put away. the
 great hatch scrubbed placed upon try-works, completely
 hiding pots; every cask sight; tackles coiled in
 unseen nooks; combined simultaneous industry of
 almost entire ship’s company, whole conscientious duty
 last concluded, crew proceed own
 ablutions; shift top toe; finally issue the
 immaculate deck, fresh aglow, bridegrooms new-leaped from
 daintiest holland.
 
now, elated step, pace planks twos threes, and
 humorously discourse parlors, sofas, carpets, fine cambrics;
 propose mat deck; think hanging top; object not
 taking tea moonlight piazza forecastle. hint to
 musked mariners oil, bone, blubber, little short

 bring us napkins!
 
mark: aloft there, three mast heads, stand three men intent
 spying whales, which, caught, infallibly will soil
 old oaken furniture, drop least one small grease-spot
 somewhere. yes; many time, when, severest
 uninterrupted labors, know night; continuing straight through
 ninety-six hours; boat, swelled their

 yea, sweatings smoked burned anew the

 sixty thereabouts, dressed spacious roundabout, hung round

“hast seen white whale?”
 
“see this?” withdrawing folds hidden it,

“man boat!” cried ahab, impetuously, tossing oars near
 him—“stand lower!”

good luck it, whale alongside day two

 us shake bones together!—an arm leg!—an arm never can
 shrink, d’ye see; leg never can run. did’st thou see
 white whale?—how long ago?”
 
“the white whale,” said englishman, pointing ivory arm towards
 east, taking rueful sight along it, a
 telescope; “there saw him, line, last season.”
 
“and took arm off, he?” asked ahab, now sliding from
 capstan, resting englishman’s shoulder, so.
 
“aye, cause it, least; leg, too?”
 
“spin yarn,” said ahab; “how it?”
 
“it first time life ever cruised line,”
 began englishman. “i ignorant white whale time.

“it he, he!” cried ahab, suddenly letting suspended

“and harpoons sticking near starboard fin.”
 
“aye, aye—they mine—_my_ irons,” cried ahab, exultingly—“but on!”
 
“give chance, then,” said englishman, good-humoredly. “well,

“aye, see!—wanted part it; free fast-fish—an old trick—i know

“it shocking bad wound,” began whale-surgeon; “and, taking my

“samuel enderby name ship,” interrupted one-armed
 captain, addressing ahab; “go on, boy.”
 
“stood old sammy northward, get blazing

“my captain, must ere perceived, respected sir”—said the
 imperturbable godly-looking bunger, slightly bowing ahab—“is apt to

 say, jack bunger, late reverend clergy—am strict total

“water!” cried captain; “he never drinks it; it’s sort fits to

“yes, may well,” said surgeon, coolly. “i observing,
 sir, captain boomer’s facetious interruption, spite my

“no, don’t,” said captain, “but mother did; born with

“what became white whale?” now cried ahab, thus far been
 impatiently listening by-play two englishmen.
 
“oh!” cried one-armed captain, “oh, yes! well; sounded, we
 didn’t see time; fact, hinted, i

“well, then,” interrupted bunger, “give left arm bait to

“no, thank ye, bunger,” said english captain, “he’s welcome the

 subjects, contained interesting account whale fishery.
 chapter was, headed, “smeer,” “fat,” found a

first place, wish lay particular, plain
 statement, touching living bulk leviathan, whose skeleton
 briefly exhibit. statement may prove useful here.
 
according careful calculation made, partly base
 upon captain scoresby’s estimate, seventy tons largest sized
 greenland whale sixty feet length; according careful
 calculation, say, sperm whale largest magnitude, between
 eighty-five ninety feet length, something less forty
 feet fullest circumference, whale will weigh least
 ninety tons; that, reckoning thirteen men ton, would
 considerably outweigh combined population whole village one
 thousand one hundred inhabitants.
 
think brains, like yoked cattle, put to
 leviathan, make budge landsman’s imagination?
 
already various ways put skull, spout-hole,
 jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, divers parts, shall now
 simply point interesting general bulk his
 unobstructed bones. colossal skull embraces large a

length, sperm whale’s skeleton tranque measured seventy-two
 feet; fully invested extended life, must have
 ninety feet long; whale, skeleton loses one
 fifth length compared living body. seventy-two
 feet, skull jaw comprised twenty feet, leaving fifty
 feet plain back-bone. attached back-bone, something less
 third length, mighty circular basket ribs
 enclosed vitals.
 
vast ivory-ribbed chest, long, unrelieved spine,
 extending far away straight line, little resembled

 twenty naked bow-ribs inserted, keel otherwise,

 seemly correspondence length. middle ribs most
 arched. arsacides used beams whereon lay

considering ribs, struck anew the
 circumstance, variously repeated book, skeleton of

 now saw naked spine, wrapped round with

 venerable john leo, old barbary traveller.
 
“not far sea-side, temple, rafters beams

chapter 105. whale’s magnitude diminish?—will perish?
 
inasmuch, then, leviathan comes floundering upon us from
 head-waters eternities, may fitly inquired, whether,
 long course generations, degenerated the
 original bulk sires.
 
upon investigation find, whales the
 present day superior magnitude whose fossil remains are
 found tertiary system (embracing distinct geological period
 prior man), whales found tertiary system, those
 belonging latter formations exceed size earlier
 ones.
 
pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, far largest the
 alabama one mentioned last chapter, less than
 seventy feet length skeleton. whereas, already seen,
 tape-measure gives seventy-two feet skeleton a
 large sized modern whale. heard, whalemen’s authority,
 sperm whales captured near hundred feet long the
 time capture.
 
may be, whales present hour an
 advance magnitude upon previous geological periods; may
 be, since adam’s time degenerated?
 
assuredly, must conclude so, credit accounts of
 gentlemen pliny, ancient naturalists generally. for
 pliny tells us whales embraced acres living bulk, and
 aldrovandus others measured eight hundred feet length—rope
 walks thames tunnels whales! even days banks and
 solander, cooke’s naturalists, find danish member academy
 sciences setting certain iceland whales (reydan-siskur, or
 wrinkled bellies) one hundred twenty yards; is, three
 hundred sixty feet. lacépède, french naturalist, his
 elaborate history whales, beginning work (page
 3), sets right whale one hundred metres, three hundred and
 twenty-eight feet. work published late a.d. 1825.
 
will whaleman believe stories? no. whale to-day is
 big ancestors pliny’s time. ever go pliny
 is, i, whaleman (more was), will make bold tell so.
 understand is, egyptian mummies
 buried thousands years even pliny born, not
 measure much coffins modern kentuckian socks;
 cattle animals sculptured oldest
 egyptian nineveh tablets, relative proportions they
 drawn, just plainly prove high-bred, stall-fed, prize
 cattle smithfield, equal, far exceed magnitude the
 fattest pharaoh’s fat kine; face this, will not
 admit animals whale alone degenerated.
 
still another inquiry remains; one often agitated more
 recondite nantucketers. whether owing almost omniscient
 look-outs mast-heads whale-ships, now penetrating even
 behring’s straits, remotest secret drawers and
 lockers world; thousand harpoons lances darted along
 continental coasts; moot point is, whether leviathan can long
 endure wide chase, remorseless havoc; whether must not
 last exterminated waters, last whale, like the
 last man, smoke last pipe, evaporate final
 puff.
 
comparing humped herds whales humped herds buffalo,
 which, forty years ago, overspread tens thousands the
 prairies illinois missouri, shook iron manes and
 scowled thunder-clotted brows upon sites populous
 river-capitals, now polite broker sells land dollar
 inch; comparison irresistible argument seem
 furnished, show hunted whale now escape speedy
 extinction.
 
must look matter every light. though short a
 period ago—not good lifetime—the census buffalo illinois
 exceeded census men now london, though present day
 one horn hoof remains region; though the
 cause wondrous extermination spear man; yet far
 different nature whale-hunt peremptorily forbids inglorious
 end leviathan. forty men one ship hunting sperm whales
 forty-eight months think done extremely well, thank
 god, last carry home oil forty fish. whereas, the
 days old canadian indian hunters trappers west,
 far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) wilderness
 virgin, number moccasined men, number of
 months, mounted horse instead sailing ships, slain
 forty, forty thousand buffaloes; fact that, need
 were, statistically stated.
 
nor, considered aright, seem argument favour the
 gradual extinction sperm whale, example, former
 years (the latter part last century, say) leviathans, in
 small pods, encountered much oftener present, and, in
 consequence, voyages prolonged, also much more
 remunerative. because, elsewhere noticed, whales,
 influenced views safety, now swim seas immense
 caravans, large degree scattered solitaries, yokes,
 pods, schools days now aggregated vast but
 widely separated, unfrequent armies. all. equally
 fallacious seems conceit, so-called whale-bone
 whales longer haunt many grounds former years abounding with
 them, hence species also declining. being
 driven promontory cape; one coast longer enlivened
 jets, then, sure, remoter strand been
 recently startled unfamiliar spectacle.
 
furthermore: concerning last mentioned leviathans, two
 firm fortresses, which, human probability, will ever remain
 impregnable. upon invasion valleys, frosty
 swiss retreated mountains; so, hunted savannas
 glades middle seas, whale-bone whales can last resort
 polar citadels, diving ultimate glassy barriers
 walls there, come among icy fields floes; charmed
 circle everlasting december, bid defiance pursuit man.
 
perhaps fifty whale-bone whales harpooned one
 cachalot, philosophers forecastle concluded this
 positive havoc already seriously diminished battalions.
 though time past number whales, less than
 13,000, annually slain nor’ west coast the
 americans alone; yet considerations render even this
 circumstance little account opposing argument this
 matter.
 
natural somewhat incredulous concerning populousness
 enormous creatures globe, yet shall say to
 harto, historian goa, tells us one hunting the
 king siam took 4,000 elephants; regions elephants are
 numerous droves cattle temperate climes. seems
 reason doubt elephants, now hunted
 thousands years, semiramis, porus, hannibal, all
 successive monarchs east—if still survive in
 great numbers, much may great whale outlast hunting, since
 pasture expatiate in, precisely twice large as
 asia, americas, europe africa, new holland, the
 isles combined.
 
moreover: consider, presumed great longevity of
 whales, probably attaining age century more,
 therefore one period time, several distinct adult generations
 must contemporary. is, may soon gain idea of,
 imagining grave-yards, cemeteries, family vaults of
 creation yielding live bodies men, women, and
 children alive seventy-five years ago; adding this
 countless host present human population globe.
 
wherefore, things, account whale immortal his
 species, however perishable individuality. swam seas
 continents broke water; swam site the
 tuileries, windsor castle, kremlin. noah’s flood he
 despised noah’s ark; ever world flooded, like

 joy-childlessness hell’s despair; whereas, guilty mortal
 miseries shall still fertilely beget eternally
 progressive progeny griefs beyond grave; hint of
 this, still seems inequality deeper analysis the
 thing. for, thought ahab, even highest earthly felicities

 bottom, heartwoes, mystic significance, and, men, an
 archangelic grandeur; diligent tracings-out belie the
 obvious deduction. trail genealogies high mortal

now, strange circumstance made known aft, carpenter

 dying men tyrannical; certainly, since will
 shortly trouble us little evermore, poor fellows be

leaning hammock, queequeg long regarded coffin an

“poor rover! will ye never done weary roving? where

chapter 112. blacksmith.
 
availing mild, summer-cool weather now reigned in
 latitudes, preparation peculiarly active pursuits
 shortly anticipated, perth, begrimed, blistered old
 blacksmith, removed portable forge hold again, after
 concluding contributory work ahab’s leg, still retained it

 incessantly invoked headsmen, harpooneers, bowsmen do

 eager circle, waiting served; holding boat-spades,
 pike-heads, harpoons, lances, jealously watching every
 sooty movement, toiled. nevertheless, old man’s a
 patient hammer wielded patient arm. murmur, impatience, no
 petulance come him. silent, slow, solemn; bowing over

 heart. was.—most miserable!
 
peculiar walk old man, certain slight painful appearing
 yawing gait, early period voyage excited the
 curiosity mariners. importunity persisted
 questionings finally given in; came pass every
 one now knew shameful story wretched fate.
 
belated, innocently, one bitter winter’s midnight, road
 running two country towns, blacksmith half-stupidly felt
 deadly numbness stealing him, sought refuge leaning,
 dilapidated barn. issue was, loss extremities both
 feet. revelation, part part, last came four
 acts gladness, one long, yet uncatastrophied
 fifth act grief life’s drama.
 
old man, who, age nearly sixty, postponedly
 encountered thing sorrow’s technicals called ruin. been
 artisan famed excellence, plenty do; owned house
 garden; embraced youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, three
 blithe, ruddy children; every sunday went cheerful-looking church,
 planted grove. one night, cover darkness, further
 concealed cunning disguisement, desperate burglar slid into
 happy home, robbed everything. darker yet to
 tell, blacksmith ignorantly conduct burglar into
 family’s heart. bottle conjuror! upon opening of
 fatal cork, forth flew fiend, shrivelled home. now,
 prudent, wise, economic reasons, blacksmith’s shop was
 basement dwelling, separate entrance it; so
 always young loving healthy wife listened no
 unhappy nervousness, vigorous pleasure, stout ringing
 young-armed old husband’s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled
 passing floors walls, came her, unsweetly,
 nursery; so, stout labor’s iron lullaby, blacksmith’s
 infants rocked slumber.
 
oh, woe woe! oh, death, canst thou sometimes timely?
 hadst thou taken old blacksmith thyself ere full ruin came
 upon him, young widow delicious grief, her
 orphans truly venerable, legendary sire dream after
 years; care-killing competency. death plucked
 virtuous elder brother, whose whistling daily toil solely
 hung responsibilities family, left worse than
 useless old man standing, till hideous rot life make him
 easier harvest.
 
tell whole? blows basement hammer every day grew
 between; blow every day grew fainter the
 last; wife sat frozen window, tearless eyes,
 glitteringly gazing weeping faces children; bellows
 fell; forge choked cinders; house sold; mother
 dived long church-yard grass; children twice followed
 thither; houseless, familyless old man staggered a
 vagabond crape; every woe unreverenced; grey head scorn to
 flaxen curls!
 
death seems desirable sequel career like this; death
 launching region strange untried; but
 first salutation possibilities immense remote, the
 wild, watery, unshored; therefore, death-longing eyes of
 men, still left interior compunctions

 alluringly spread forth whole plain unimaginable, taking
 terrors, wonderful, new-life adventures; hearts of
 infinite pacifics, thousand mermaids sing them—“come hither,

 death; wonders supernatural, without dying them. come

 abhorring, landed world, oblivious death. come hither! put
 _thy_ gravestone, too, within churchyard, come hither, till
 marry thee!”
 
hearkening voices, east west, early sunrise, by
 fall eve, blacksmith’s soul responded, aye, come! perth
 went a-whaling.
 

chapter 113. forge.
 
matted beard, swathed bristling shark-skin apron, about
 mid-day, perth standing forge anvil, latter
 placed upon iron-wood log, one hand holding pike-head the
 coals, forge’s lungs, captain ahab came
 along, carrying hand small rusty-looking leathern bag. while
 yet little distance forge, moody ahab paused; till last,
 perth, withdrawing iron fire, began hammering upon the
 anvil—the red mass sending sparks thick hovering flights,
 flew close ahab.
 
“are thy mother carey’s chickens, perth? always flying
 thy wake; birds good omen, too, all;—look here, they
 burn; thou—thou liv’st among without scorch.”
 
“because scorched over, captain ahab,” answered perth, resting
 moment hammer; “i past scorching; easily can’st
 thou scorch scar.”
 
“well, well; more. thy shrunk voice sounds calmly, sanely woeful
 me. paradise myself, impatient misery others
 mad. thou should’st go mad, blacksmith; say, dost thou
 go mad? can’st thou endure without mad? heavens
 yet hate thee, thou can’st go mad?—what wert thou making
 there?”
 
“welding old pike-head, sir; seams dents it.”
 
“and can’st thou make smooth again, blacksmith, hard
 usage had?”
 
“i think so, sir.”
 
“and suppose thou can’st smoothe almost seams dents; never
 mind hard metal, blacksmith?”
 
“aye, sir, think can; seams dents one.”
 
“look ye here, then,” cried ahab, passionately advancing, leaning
 hands perth’s shoulders; “look ye here—_here_—can ye
 smoothe seam like this, blacksmith,” sweeping one hand across his
 ribbed brow; “if thou could’st, blacksmith, glad enough lay my
 head upon thy anvil, feel thy heaviest hammer eyes.
 answer! can’st thou smoothe seam?”
 
“oh! one, sir! said seams dents one?”
 
“aye, blacksmith, one; aye, man, unsmoothable; for
 though thou see’st flesh, worked into
 bone skull—_that_ wrinkles! but, away child’s
 play; gaffs pikes to-day. look ye here!” jingling the
 leathern bag, full gold coins. “i, too, want harpoon
 made; one thousand yoke fiends part, perth;
 something will stick whale like fin-bone. there’s the
 stuff,” flinging pouch upon anvil. “look ye, blacksmith, these
 gathered nail-stubbs steel shoes racing horses.”
 
“horse-shoe stubbs, sir? why, captain ahab, thou hast here, then, the
 best stubbornest stuff blacksmiths ever work.”
 
“i know it, old man; stubbs will weld together like glue the
 melted bones murderers. quick! forge harpoon. forge me
 first, twelve rods shank; wind, twist, hammer
 twelve together like yarns strands tow-line. quick!
 i’ll blow fire.”
 
last twelve rods made, ahab tried them, one one, by
 spiralling them, hand, round long, heavy iron bolt. “a
 flaw!” rejecting last one. “work again, perth.”
 
done, perth begin welding twelve one, when
 ahab stayed hand, said weld iron. as, then,
 regular, gasping hems, hammered anvil, perth passing to
 glowing rods, one other, hard pressed forge
 shooting intense straight flame, parsee passed silently, and
 bowing head towards fire, seemed invoking curse or
 blessing toil. but, ahab looked up, slid aside.
 
“what’s bunch lucifers dodging for?” muttered
 stubb, looking forecastle. “that parsee smells fire like a
 fusee; smells himself, like hot musket’s powder-pan.”
 
last shank, one complete rod, received final heat; as
 perth, temper it, plunged hissing cask water near
 by, scalding steam shot ahab’s bent face.
 
“would’st thou brand me, perth?” wincing moment pain;
 “have forging branding-iron, then?”
 
“pray god, that; yet fear something, captain ahab. this
 harpoon white whale?”
 
“for white fiend! now barbs; thou must make them
 thyself, man. razors—the best steel; here, make the
 barbs sharp needle-sleet icy sea.”
 
moment, old blacksmith eyed razors though would
 fain use them.
 
“take them, man, need them; now neither shave, sup,
 pray till—but here—to work!”
 
fashioned last arrowy shape, welded perth the
 shank, steel soon pointed end iron; the
 blacksmith giving barbs final heat, prior to
 tempering them, cried ahab place water-cask near.
 
“no, no—no water that; want true death-temper. ahoy,
 there! tashtego, queequeg, daggoo! say ye, pagans! will ye give me
 much blood will cover barb?” holding high up. cluster
 dark nods replied, yes. three punctures made heathen
 flesh, white whale’s barbs tempered.
 
“ego non baptizo nomine patris, sed nomine diaboli!”
 deliriously howled ahab, malignant iron scorchingly devoured the
 baptismal blood.
 
now, mustering spare poles below, selecting one of
 hickory, bark still investing it, ahab fitted end the
 socket iron. coil new tow-line unwound, some
 fathoms taken windlass, stretched great tension.
 pressing foot upon it, till rope hummed like harp-string,
 eagerly bending it, seeing strandings, ahab exclaimed,
 “good! now seizings.”
 
one extremity rope unstranded, separate spread yarns
 braided woven round socket harpoon; pole
 driven hard socket; lower end rope
 traced half-way along pole’s length, firmly secured so,
 intertwistings twine. done, pole, iron, rope—like the
 three fates—remained inseparable, ahab moodily stalked away with
 weapon; sound ivory leg, sound hickory
 pole, hollowly ringing along every plank. ere entered his
 cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet piteous sound was
 heard. oh, pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle unresting eye; thy
 strange mummeries unmeaningly blended black tragedy the
 melancholy ship, mocked it!

 willingly remember, velvet paw conceals a
 remorseless fang.
 
times, whale-boat rover softly feels a
 certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards sea; he
 regards much flowery earth; distant ship revealing

 western emigrants’ horses show erected ears, their

jolly enough sights sounds came bearing down

nantucket ship, bachelor, just wedged her
 last cask oil, bolted bursting hatches; now, in
 glad holiday apparel, joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,
 sailing round among widely-separated ships ground, previous
 pointing prow home.
 
three men mast-head wore long streamers narrow red
 bunting hats; stern, whale-boat suspended,
 bottom down; hanging captive bowsprit seen long
 lower jaw last whale slain. signals, ensigns, jacks

 lashed three basketed tops two barrels sperm;
 which, top-mast cross-trees, saw slender breakers of
 precious fluid; nailed main truck brazen

afterwards learned, bachelor met most
 surprising success; wonderful, cruising in
 seas numerous vessels gone entire months without
 securing single fish. barrels beef bread been
 given away make room far valuable sperm, additional
 supplemental casks bartered for, ships met;
 stowed along deck, captain’s and

 reserved thrust hands into, self-complacent testimony of
 entire satisfaction.
 
glad ship good luck bore upon moody pequod, the

ahab, standing quarter-deck, shaggy black,

 things come—their two captains impersonated the
 whole striking contrast scene.
 
“come aboard, come aboard!” cried gay bachelor’s commander, lifting
 glass bottle air.
 
“hast seen white whale?” gritted ahab reply.
 
“no; heard him; don’t believe all,” said the
 good-humoredly. “come aboard!”
 
“thou art damned jolly. sail on. hast lost men?”
 
“not enough speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come aboard, old
 hearty, come along. i’ll soon take black brow. come
 along, will ye (merry’s play); full ship homeward-bound.”
 
“how wondrous familiar fool!” muttered ahab; aloud, “thou art

 empty ship, outward-bound. go thy ways, will mine. forward
 there! set sail, keep wind!”
 
thus, one ship went cheerily breeze, other
 stubbornly fought it; two vessels parted; crew
 pequod looking grave, lingering glances towards the
 receding bachelor; bachelor’s men never heeding gaze for
 lively revelry in. ahab, leaning the
 taffrail, eyed homeward-bound craft, took pocket a

soothed again, soothed deeper gloom, ahab, sterned
 whale, sat intently watching final wanings the
 now tranquil boat. strange spectacle observable sperm
 whales dying—the turning sunwards head, expiring—that
 strange spectacle, beheld placid evening, somehow ahab
 conveyed wondrousness unknown before.
 
“he turns turns it,—how slowly, steadfastly, his

“then hail, ever hail, sea, whose eternal tossings wild

chapter 117. whale watch.
 
four whales slain evening died wide apart; one, far to
 windward; one, less distant, leeward; one ahead; one astern. these
 last three brought alongside ere nightfall; windward one
 reached till morning; boat killed lay
 side night; boat ahab’s.
 
waif-pole thrust upright dead whale’s spout-hole; and
 lantern hanging top, cast troubled flickering glare upon
 black, glossy back, far upon midnight waves, which
 gently chafed whale’s broad flank, like soft surf upon beach.
 
ahab boat’s crew seemed asleep parsee; who
 crouching bow, sat watching sharks, spectrally played
 round whale, tapped light cedar planks tails. a
 sound like moaning squadrons asphaltites unforgiven
 ghosts gomorrah, ran shuddering air.
 
started slumbers, ahab, face face, saw parsee; and
 hooped round gloom night seemed last men a
 flooded world. “i dreamed again,” said he.
 
“of hearses? said, old man, neither hearse nor
 coffin can thine?”
 
“and hearsed die sea?”
 
“but said, old man, ere thou couldst die voyage, two
 hearses must verily seen thee sea; first made by
 mortal hands; visible wood last one must grown in

“aye, aye! strange sight that, parsee:—a hearse plumes
 floating ocean waves pall-bearers. ha! a

“believe not, thou canst die till seen, old man.”
 
“and saying thyself?”
 
“though come last, shall still go thee thy pilot.”
 
“and thou art gone before—if ever befall—then ere can

 well, then, believe ye say, oh pilot! two

“take another pledge, old man,” said parsee, eyes lighted up
 like fire-flies gloom—“hemp can kill thee.”
 
“the gallows, ye mean.—i immortal then, land sea,” cried
 ahab, laugh derision;—“immortal land sea!”
 
silent again, one man. grey dawn came on, the
 slumbering crew arose boat’s bottom, ere noon dead

season line length drew near; every day ahab,
 coming cabin, cast eyes aloft, vigilant helmsman would
 ostentatiously handle spokes, eager mariners quickly run to
 braces, stand eyes centrally fixed
 nailed doubloon; impatient order point ship’s
 prow equator. good time order came. hard upon
 high noon; ahab, seated bows high-hoisted boat, was
 taking wonted daily observation sun determine his
 latitude.
 
now, japanese sea, days summer freshets of
 effulgences. unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems blazing
 focus glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. sky looks
 lacquered; clouds none; horizon floats; this
 nakedness unrelieved radiance insufferable splendors of
 god’s throne. well ahab’s quadrant furnished coloured
 glasses, take sight solar fire. so, swinging
 seated form roll ship, his
 astrological-looking instrument placed eye, remained that
 posture moments catch precise instant sun
 gain precise meridian. meantime whole attention
 absorbed, parsee kneeling beneath ship’s deck,
 face thrown like ahab’s, eyeing sun him;
 lids eyes half hooded orbs, wild face was
 subdued earthly passionlessness. length desired
 observation taken; pencil upon ivory leg, ahab
 soon calculated latitude must precise instant. then
 falling moment’s revery, looked towards sun and
 murmured himself: “thou sea-mark! thou high mighty pilot! thou
 tellest truly _am_—but canst thou cast least hint where
 _shall_ be? canst thou tell thing besides is
 moment living? moby dick? instant thou must be
 eyeing him. eyes mine look eye even now
 beholding him; aye, eye even now equally beholding
 objects unknown, thither side thee, thou sun!”
 
gazing quadrant, handling, one other, its
 numerous cabalistical contrivances, pondered again, muttered:
 “foolish toy! babies’ plaything haughty admirals, commodores,
 captains; world brags thee, thy cunning might; but
 canst thou do, tell poor, pitiful point, where
 thou thyself happenest wide planet, hand that
 holds thee: no! one jot more! thou canst tell one drop of
 water one grain sand will to-morrow noon; yet thy
 impotence thou insultest sun! science! curse thee, thou vain toy;
 cursed things cast man’s eyes aloft heaven,
 whose live vividness scorches him, old eyes even now
 scorched thy light, sun! level nature earth’s horizon
 glances man’s eyes; shot crown head, as
 god meant gaze firmament. curse thee, thou
 quadrant!” dashing deck, “no longer will guide earthly
 way thee; level ship’s compass, level dead-reckoning, by
 log line; _these_ shall conduct me, show place the
 sea. aye,” lighting boat deck, “thus trample thee,
 thou paltry thing feebly pointest high; thus split and
 destroy thee!”
 
frantic old man thus spoke thus trampled live and
 dead feet, sneering triumph seemed meant ahab, a
 fatalistic despair seemed meant himself—these passed the
 mute, motionless parsee’s face. unobserved rose glided away;
 while, awestruck aspect commander, seamen clustered
 together forecastle, till ahab, troubledly pacing deck,
 shouted out—“to braces! helm!—square in!”
 
instant yards swung round; ship half-wheeled upon
 heel, three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her
 long, ribbed hull, seemed three horatii pirouetting one
 sufficient steed.
 
standing knight-heads, starbuck watched pequod’s
 tumultuous way, ahab’s also, went lurching along deck.
 
“i sat dense coal fire watched aglow, full
 tormented flaming life; seen wane last, down,
 down, dumbest dust. old man oceans! fiery life of
 thine, will length remain one little heap ashes!”
 
“aye,” cried stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, mr.
 starbuck—sea-coal, common charcoal. well, well; heard ahab
 mutter, ‘here one thrusts cards old hands of
 mine; swears must play them, others.’ damn me, ahab,
 thou actest right; live game, die it!”

towards evening day, pequod torn canvas, and
 bare-poled left fight typhoon struck directly

 top cranes, windward quarter boat (ahab’s) did
 escape. great rolling sea, dashing high reeling
 ship’s high teetering side, stove boat’s bottom stern,
 left again, dripping like sieve.
 
“bad work, bad work! mr. starbuck,” said stubb, regarding wreck,
 “but will way. stubb, one, can’t fight it. you
 see, mr. starbuck, wave great long start leaps,

“avast stubb,” cried starbuck, “let typhoon sing, strike his
 harp rigging; thou art brave man thou wilt hold

“but brave man; never said brave man; coward;

 starbuck, there’s way stop singing world cut my

“madman! look eyes thou hast none thine own.”
 
“what! can see better dark night anybody else, never

“here!” cried starbuck, seizing stubb shoulder, pointing his
 hand towards weather bow, “markest thou gale comes
 eastward, course ahab run moby dick? the

“i don’t half understand ye: what’s wind?”
 
“yes, yes, round cape good hope shortest way to

 question. “the gale now hammers us stave us, can turn it

moment one intervals profound darkness, following
 flashes, voice heard side; almost same
 instant volley thunder peals rolled overhead.
 
“who’s there?”
 
“old thunder!” said ahab, groping way along bulwarks his
 pivot-hole; suddenly finding path made plain elbowed
 lances fire.
 
now, lightning rod spire shore intended carry off
 perilous fluid soil; kindred rod some
 ships carry mast, intended conduct water. but
 conductor must descend considerable depth, end may
 avoid contact hull; moreover, kept constantly
 towing there, liable many mishaps, besides interfering
 little rigging, less impeding the
 vessel’s way water; this, lower parts a
 ship’s lightning-rods always overboard; generally made
 long slender links, readily hauled the
 chains outside, thrown sea, occasion may require.
 
“the rods! rods!” cried starbuck crew, suddenly admonished
 vigilance vivid lightning just darting
 flambeaux, light ahab post. “are overboard? drop them
 over, fore aft. quick!”
 
“avast!” cried ahab; “let’s fair play here, though the
 weaker side. yet i’ll contribute raise rods himmalehs and
 andes, world may secured; privileges! let

“look aloft!” cried starbuck. “the corpusants! corpusants!”
 
yard-arms tipped pallid fire; touched each
 tri-pointed lightning-rod-end three tapering white flames, of
 three tall masts silently burning sulphurous air, like
 three gigantic wax tapers altar.
 
“blast boat! let go!” cried stubb instant, swashing
 heaved little craft, gunwale violently
 jammed hand, passing lashing. “blast it!”—but slipping
 backward deck, uplifted eyes caught flames; and
 immediately shifting tone cried—“the corpusants mercy us
 all!”
 
sailors, oaths household words; will swear trance of
 calm, teeth tempest; will imprecate curses
 topsail-yard-arms, teeter seething
 sea; voyagings, seldom heard common oath when
 god’s burning finger laid ship; “mene, mene,
 tekel upharsin” woven shrouds cordage.
 
pallidness burning aloft, words heard the
 enchanted crew; one thick cluster stood forecastle, all
 eyes gleaming pale phosphorescence, like far away
 constellation stars. relieved ghostly light, the
 gigantic jet negro, daggoo, loomed thrice real stature, and
 seemed black cloud thunder come. parted
 mouth tashtego revealed shark-white teeth, strangely
 gleamed tipped corpusants; lit by

“no, no, wasn’t; said corpusants mercy us all; i

moment starbuck caught sight stubb’s face slowly beginning
 glimmer sight. glancing upwards, cried: “see! see!” once
 high tapering flames beheld seemed redoubled
 supernaturalness pallor.
 
“the corpusants mercy us all,” cried stubb, again.
 
base mainmast, full beneath doubloon flame,
 parsee kneeling ahab’s front, head bowed away
 him; near by, arched overhanging rigging, where
 just engaged securing spar, number seamen,
 arrested glare, now cohered together, hung pendulous, like a
 knot numbed wasps drooping, orchard twig. various
 enchanted attitudes, like standing, stepping, running
 skeletons herculaneum, others remained rooted deck; all
 eyes upcast.
 
“aye, aye, men!” cried ahab. “look it; mark well; white
 flame lights way white whale! hand mainmast
 links there; fain feel pulse, let mine beat against
 it; blood fire! so.”
 
turning—the last link held fast left hand, put foot
 upon parsee; fixed upward eye, high-flung right arm,
 stood erect lofty tri-pointed trinity flames.
 
“oh! thou clear spirit clear fire, seas persian

[_sudden, repeated flashes lightning; nine flames leap
 lengthwise thrice previous height; ahab, rest, closes
 eyes, right hand pressed hard upon them._]
 
“i thy speechless, placeless power; said so? wrung

 haughty agony, read sire. leap! leap up, lick sky! leap

“the boat! boat!” cried starbuck, “look thy boat, old man!”
 
ahab’s harpoon, one forged perth’s fire, remained firmly lashed
 conspicuous crotch, projected beyond whale-boat’s
 bow; stove bottom caused loose leather
 sheath drop off; keen steel barb now came a
 levelled flame pale, forked fire. silent harpoon burned there
 like serpent’s tongue, starbuck grasped ahab arm—“god, god is
 thee, old man; forbear! ’tis ill voyage! ill begun, ill
 continued; let square yards, may, old man, make a
 fair wind homewards, go better voyage this.”
 
overhearing starbuck, panic-stricken crew instantly ran the
 braces—though sail left aloft. moment aghast
 mate’s thoughts seemed theirs; raised half mutinous cry. but
 dashing rattling lightning links deck, snatching the
 burning harpoon, ahab waved like torch among them; swearing to
 transfix first sailor cast loose rope’s end.
 petrified aspect, still shrinking fiery dart
 held, men fell back dismay, ahab spoke:—
 
“all oaths hunt white whale binding mine; and
 heart, soul, body, lungs life, old ahab bound. ye
 may know tune heart beats; look ye here; thus blow out
 last fear!” one blast breath extinguished the
 flame.
 
hurricane sweeps plain, men fly neighborhood of
 lone, gigantic elm, whose height strength render it
 much unsafe, much mark for
 thunderbolts; last words ahab’s many mariners did
 run terror dismay.

“yes, fellow’s soaked through, it’s hard sensible, that’s

hours midnight, typhoon abated much, the

 cut adrift spars, went eddying away leeward, like

compliance standing order commander—to report

 mechanically went apprise captain ahab circumstance.
 
ere knocking state-room, involuntarily paused a
 moment. cabin lamp—taking long swings way that—was burning
 fitfully, casting fitful shadows upon old man’s bolted door,—a
 thin one, fixed blinds inserted, place upper panels. the
 isolated subterraneousness cabin made certain humming silence
 reign there, though hooped round roar the
 elements. loaded muskets rack shiningly revealed, as
 stood upright forward bulkhead. starbuck an
 honest, upright man; starbuck’s heart, instant when
 saw muskets, strangely evolved evil thought; so
 blent neutral good accompaniments instant he
 hardly knew itself.
 
“he shot once,” murmured, “yes, there’s very

 placed death-tube rack, left place.

chapter 124. needle.
 
next morning not-yet-subsided rolled long slow billows of
 mighty bulk, striving pequod’s gurgling track, pushed on
 like giants’ palms outspread. strong, unstaggering breeze abounded
 so, sky air seemed vast outbellying sails; whole world
 boomed wind. muffled full morning light, the
 invisible sun known spread intensity place;
 bayonet rays moved stacks. emblazonings, crowned
 babylonian kings queens, reigned everything. a
 crucible molten gold, bubblingly leaps light heat.
 
long maintaining enchanted silence, ahab stood apart; every time
 tetering ship loweringly pitched bowsprit, turned to
 eye bright sun’s rays produced ahead; profoundly
 settled stern, turned behind, saw sun’s rearward
 place, yellow rays blending undeviating
 wake.
 
“ha, ha, ship! thou mightest well taken now sea-chariot
 sun. ho, ho! ye nations prow, bring sun to
 ye! yoke billows; hallo! tandem, drive sea!”
 
suddenly reined back counter thought, hurried towards
 helm, huskily demanding ship heading.
 
“east-sou-east, sir,” said frightened steersman.
 
“thou liest!” smiting clenched fist. “heading east this
 hour morning, sun astern?”
 
upon every soul confounded; phenomenon just then
 observed ahab unaccountably escaped every one else; very
 blinding palpableness must cause.
 
thrusting head half way binnacle, ahab caught one glimpse
 compasses; uplifted arm slowly fell; moment almost
 seemed stagger. standing behind starbuck looked, lo! two
 compasses pointed east, pequod infallibly going west.
 
ere first wild alarm get abroad among crew, the
 old man rigid laugh exclaimed, “i it! happened
 before. mr. starbuck, last night’s thunder turned compasses—that’s
 all. thou hast now heard thing, take it.”
 
“aye; never happened me, sir,” said pale mate,
 gloomily.
 
here, must needs said, accidents like than
 one case occurred ships violent storms. magnetic energy, as
 developed mariner’s needle, is, know, essentially one
 electricity beheld heaven; hence much
 marvelled at, things be. instances lightning
 actually struck vessel, smite spars
 rigging, effect upon needle times still more
 fatal; loadstone virtue annihilated, before
 magnetic steel use old wife’s knitting needle.
 either case, needle never again, itself, recovers the
 original virtue thus marred lost; binnacle compasses be
 affected, fate reaches others may ship;
 even lowermost one inserted kelson.
 
deliberately standing binnacle, eyeing transpointed
 compasses, old man, sharp extended hand, now took
 precise bearing sun, satisfied needles were
 exactly inverted, shouted orders ship’s course be
 changed accordingly. yards hard up; pequod
 thrust undaunted bows opposing wind, supposed fair
 one juggling her.
 
meanwhile, whatever secret thoughts, starbuck said
 nothing, quietly issued requisite orders; stubb and
 flask—who small degree seemed sharing his
 feelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. men, though some
 lowly rumbled, fear ahab greater fear
 fate. ever before, pagan harpooneers remained almost
 wholly unimpressed; impressed, certain
 magnetism shot congenial hearts inflexible ahab’s.
 
space old man walked deck rolling reveries. but
 chancing slip ivory heel, saw crushed copper
 sight-tubes quadrant day dashed deck.
 
“thou poor, proud heaven-gazer sun’s pilot! yesterday wrecked
 thee, to-day compasses fain wrecked me. so, so. but
 ahab lord level loadstone yet. mr. starbuck—a lance without
 pole; top-maul, smallest sail-maker’s needles.
 quick!”
 
accessory, perhaps, impulse dictating thing now about
 do, certain prudential motives, whose object might to
 revive spirits crew stroke subtile skill, a
 matter wondrous inverted compasses. besides, old
 man well knew steer transpointed needles, though clumsily
 practicable, thing passed superstitious
 sailors, without shudderings evil portents.
 
“men,” said he, steadily turning upon crew, mate handed him
 things demanded, “my men, thunder turned old ahab’s
 needles; bit steel ahab can make one own,
 will point true any.”
 
abashed glances servile wonder exchanged sailors, as
 said; fascinated eyes awaited whatever magic
 might follow. starbuck looked away.
 
blow top-maul ahab knocked steel head the
 lance, handing mate long iron rod remaining, bade
 hold upright, without touching deck. then, the
 maul, repeatedly smiting upper end iron rod, he
 placed blunted needle endwise top it, less strongly
 hammered that, several times, mate still holding rod before.
 going small strange motions it—whether
 indispensable magnetizing steel, merely intended to
 augment awe crew, uncertain—he called linen thread;
 moving binnacle, slipped two reversed needles there,
 horizontally suspended sail-needle middle, one of
 compass-cards. first, steel went round round, quivering
 vibrating either end; last settled place, when
 ahab, intently watching result, stepped frankly
 back binnacle, pointing stretched arm towards it,
 exclaimed,—“look ye, yourselves, ahab lord level
 loadstone! sun east, compass swears it!”
 
one another peered in, nothing eyes could
 persuade ignorance theirs, one another slunk
 away.
 
fiery eyes scorn triumph, saw ahab his
 fatal pride.
 

chapter 125. log line.
 
now fated pequod long afloat voyage, log
 line seldom use. owing confident reliance
 upon means determining vessel’s place, merchantmen,
 many whalemen, especially cruising, wholly neglect heave
 log; though time, frequently form’s sake
 anything else, regularly putting upon customary slate the
 course steered ship, well presumed average rate of
 progression every hour. thus pequod. wooden
 reel angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the
 railing bulwarks. rains spray damped it; sun and
 wind warped it; elements combined rot thing that
 hung idly. heedless this, mood seized ahab, he
 happened glance upon reel, many hours magnet
 scene, remembered quadrant more, recalled his
 frantic oath level log line. ship sailing
 plungingly; astern billows rolled riots.
 
“forward, there! heave log!”
 
two seamen came. golden-hued tahitian grizzly manxman.
 “take reel, one ye, i’ll heave.”
 
went towards extreme stern, ship’s lee side, the
 deck, oblique energy wind, now almost dipping into
 creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.
 
manxman took reel, holding high up, projecting
 handle-ends spindle, round spool line revolved, so
 stood angular log hanging downwards, till ahab advanced to
 him.
 
ahab stood him, lightly unwinding thirty forty
 turns form preliminary hand-coil toss overboard, old
 manxman, intently eyeing line, made bold to
 speak.
 
“sir, mistrust it; line looks far gone, long heat wet have
 spoiled it.”
 
“’twill hold, old gentleman. long heat wet, spoiled thee?
 thou seem’st hold. or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; thou it.”
 
“i hold spool, sir. just captain says. grey
 hairs mine ’tis worth disputing, ’specially a
 superior, who’ll ne’er confess.”
 
“what’s that? now’s patched professor queen nature’s
 granite-founded college; methinks he’s subservient. wert
 thou born?”
 
“in little rocky isle man, sir.”
 
“excellent! thou’st hit world that.”
 
“i know not, sir, born there.”
 
“in isle man, hey? well, way, it’s good. here’s man
 man; man born independent man, now unmanned man;
 sucked in—by what? reel! dead, blind wall
 butts inquiring heads last. it! so.”
 
log heaved. loose coils rapidly straightened long
 dragging line astern, then, instantly, reel began whirl. in
 turn, jerkingly raised lowered rolling billows, towing
 resistance log caused old reelman stagger strangely.
 
“hold hard!”
 
snap! overstrained line sagged one long festoon; the
 tugging log gone.
 
“i crush quadrant, thunder turns needles, now mad
 parts log-line. ahab can mend all. haul here, tahitian;
 reel up, manxman. look ye, let carpenter make another log, and
 mend thou line. see it.”
 
“there goes now; nothing’s happened; me, skewer
 seems loosening middle world. haul in, haul in,
 tahitian! lines run whole, whirling out: come broken, and
 dragging slow. ha, pip? come help; eh, pip?”
 
“pip? call ye pip? pip jumped whale-boat. pip’s missing.
 let’s see now ye haven’t fished here, fisherman. drags
 hard; guess he’s holding on. jerk him, tahiti! jerk off; haul
 cowards here. ho! there’s arm just breaking water. hatchet!
 hatchet! cut off—we haul cowards here. captain ahab! sir,
 sir! here’s pip, trying get board again.”
 
“peace, thou crazy loon,” cried manxman, seizing arm.
 “away quarter-deck!”
 
“the greater idiot ever scolds lesser,” muttered ahab, advancing.
 “hands holiness! sayest thou pip was, boy?
 
“astern there, sir, astern! lo! lo!”
 
“and art thou, boy? see reflection vacant pupils of
 thy eyes. oh god! man thing immortal souls to
 sieve through! art thou, boy?”
 
“bell-boy, sir; ship’s-crier; ding, dong, ding! pip! pip! pip! one
 hundred pounds clay reward pip; five feet high—looks
 cowardly—quickest known that! ding, dong, ding! who’s seen pip the
 coward?”
 
“there can hearts snow-line. oh, ye frozen heavens!
 look here. ye beget luckless child, abandoned
 him, ye creative libertines. here, boy; ahab’s cabin shall pip’s
 home henceforth, ahab lives. thou touchest inmost centre, boy;
 thou art tied cords woven heart-strings. come, let’s
 down.”
 
“what’s this? here’s velvet shark-skin,” intently gazing ahab’s
 hand, feeling it. “ah, now, poor pip felt kind thing
 this, perhaps ne’er lost! seems me, sir, a
 man-rope; something weak souls may hold by. oh, sir, let old perth
 now come rivet two hands together; black one the
 white, will let go.”
 
“oh, boy, will thee, unless thereby drag thee worse
 horrors here. come, then, cabin. lo! ye believers in
 gods goodness, man ill, you! see omniscient gods
 oblivious suffering man; man, though idiotic, knowing not
 does, yet full sweet things love gratitude. come!
 feel prouder leading thee thy black hand, though grasped an
 emperor’s!”
 
“there go two daft ones now,” muttered old manxman. “one daft with
 strength, daft weakness. here’s end the
 rotten line—all dripping, too. mend it, eh? think best a
 new line altogether. i’ll see mr. stubb it.”

steering now south-eastward ahab’s levelled steel, progress
 solely determined ahab’s level log line; pequod held her
 path towards equator. making long passage such
 unfrequented waters, descrying ships, ere long, sideways
 impelled unvarying trade winds, waves monotonously mild; all
 seemed strange calm things preluding riotous and

 looking down, little tossed heap white bubbles blue the

life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped stern, it
 always hung obedient cunning spring; hand rose seize it,
 sun long beat upon cask shrunken, it
 slowly filled, parched wood also filled every pore; and
 studded iron-bound cask followed sailor bottom, to

 heard night before. old manxman said nay.
 
lost life-buoy now replaced; starbuck directed see
 it; cask sufficient lightness found, in
 feverish eagerness seemed approaching crisis the
 voyage, hands impatient toil directly
 connected final end, whatever might prove be;
 therefore, going leave ship’s stern unprovided a
 buoy, certain strange signs inuendoes queequeg hinted a
 hint concerning coffin.
 
“a life-buoy coffin!” cried starbuck, starting.
 
“rather queer, that, say,” said stubb.
 
“it will make good enough one,” said flask, “the carpenter can
 arrange easily.”
 
“bring up; there’s nothing else it,” said starbuck, a
 melancholy pause. “rig it, carpenter; look so—the coffin,
 mean. dost thou hear me? rig it.”
 
“and shall nail lid, sir?” moving hand hammer.
 
“aye.”
 
“and shall caulk seams, sir?” moving hand a
 caulking-iron.
 
“aye.”
 
“and shall pay pitch, sir?” moving hand
 pitch-pot.
 
“away! possesses thee this? make life-buoy coffin, and
 more.—mr. stubb, mr. flask, come forward me.”
 
“he goes huff. whole can endure; parts he
 baulks. now don’t like this. make leg captain ahab, he

“then tell me; art thou arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,

“but mean anything, sir. do.”

chapter 128. pequod meets rachel.
 
next day, large ship, rachel, descried, bearing directly down
 upon pequod, spars thickly clustering men. time
 pequod making good speed water; the
 broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh her, boastful sails all
 fell together blank bladders burst, life fled from
 smitten hull.
 
“bad news; brings bad news,” muttered old manxman. ere her
 commander, who, trumpet mouth, stood boat; ere he
 hopefully hail, ahab’s voice heard.
 
“hast seen white whale?”
 
“aye, yesterday. ye seen whale-boat adrift?”
 
throttling joy, ahab negatively answered unexpected question;
 fain boarded stranger, stranger
 captain himself, stopped vessel’s way, seen descending
 side. keen pulls, boat-hook soon clinched the
 pequod’s main-chains, sprang deck. immediately was
 recognised ahab nantucketer knew. formal salutation
 exchanged.
 
“where he?—not killed!—not killed!” cried ahab, closely advancing.
 “how it?”
 
seemed somewhat late afternoon day previous,
 three stranger’s boats engaged shoal of
 whales, led four five miles ship; and
 yet swift chase windward, white hump head
 moby dick suddenly loomed water, far to
 leeward; whereupon, fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had been
 instantly lowered chase. keen sail wind, this
 fourth boat—the swiftest keeled all—seemed succeeded in
 fastening—at least, well man mast-head tell
 anything it. distance saw diminished dotted boat;
 swift gleam bubbling white water; nothing
 more; whence concluded stricken whale must have
 indefinitely run away pursuers, often happens. was
 apprehension, positive alarm, yet. recall signals
 placed rigging; darkness came on; forced pick her
 three far windward boats—ere going quest fourth one the
 precisely opposite direction—the ship necessitated to
 leave boat fate till near midnight, but, time, to
 increase distance it. rest crew last
 safe aboard, crowded sail—stunsail stunsail—after the
 missing boat; kindling fire try-pots beacon; every
 man aloft look-out. though thus sailed a
 sufficient distance gain presumed place absent ones when
 last seen; though paused lower spare boats pull all
 around her; finding anything, dashed on; again
 paused, lowered boats; though thus continued doing
 till daylight; yet least glimpse missing keel been
 seen.
 
story told, stranger captain immediately went reveal his
 object boarding pequod. desired ship unite his
 search; sailing four five miles
 apart, parallel lines, sweeping double horizon, were.
 
“i will wager something now,” whispered stubb flask, “that one
 missing boat wore captain’s best coat; mayhap, his
 watch—he’s cursed anxious get back. ever heard two
 pious whale-ships cruising one missing whale-boat height
 whaling season? see, flask, see pale looks—pale in
 buttons eyes—look—it wasn’t coat—it must been
 the—”
 
“my boy, boy among them. god’s sake—i beg, i
 conjure”—here exclaimed stranger captain ahab, thus far had
 icily received petition. “for eight-and-forty hours let me
 charter ship—i will gladly pay it, roundly pay it—if
 way—for eight-and-forty hours only—only that—you
 must, oh, must, _shall_ thing.”
 
“his son!” cried stubb, “oh, it’s he’s lost! take back the
 coat watch—what says ahab? must save boy.”
 
“he’s drowned rest ’em, last night,” said old manx
 sailor standing behind them; “i heard; ye heard spirits.”
 
now, shortly turned out, made incident rachel’s
 melancholy, circumstance, one the
 captain’s sons among number missing boat’s crew; among
 number boat’s crews, time, the
 hand, separated ship dark vicissitudes the
 chase, still another son; time, the
 wretched father plunged bottom cruellest perplexity;
 solved chief mate’s instinctively
 adopting ordinary procedure whale-ship emergencies,
 is, placed jeopardized divided boats, always to
 pick majority first. captain, unknown
 constitutional reason, refrained mentioning this, not
 till forced ahab’s iciness allude one yet
 missing boy; little lad, twelve years old, whose father the
 earnest unmisgiving hardihood nantucketer’s paternal love, had
 thus early sought initiate perils wonders a
 vocation almost immemorially destiny race. it
 unfrequently occur, nantucket captains will send such
 tender age away them, protracted three four years’ voyage
 ship own; first knowledge a
 whaleman’s career shall unenervated chance display a
 father’s natural untimely partiality, undue apprehensiveness and
 concern.
 
meantime, now stranger still beseeching poor boon ahab;
 ahab still stood like anvil, receiving every shock, without
 least quivering own.
 
“i will go,” said stranger, “till say _aye_ me. me
 like case. _you_ a
 boy, captain ahab—though child, nestling safely home now—a
 child old age too—yes, yes, relent; see it—run, run, men,
 now, stand square yards.”
 
“avast,” cried ahab—“touch rope-yarn”; voice that
 prolongingly moulded every word—“captain gardiner, will it.
 even now lose time. good-bye, good-bye. god bless ye, man, may i
 forgive myself, must go. mr. starbuck, look binnacle
 watch, three minutes present instant warn all
 strangers: brace forward again, let ship sail before.”
 
hurriedly turning, averted face, descended cabin,
 leaving strange captain transfixed unconditional utter
 rejection earnest suit. starting enchantment,
 gardiner silently hurried side; fell stepped his
 boat, returned ship.
 
soon two ships diverged wakes; long strange vessel
 view, seen yaw hither thither every dark spot,
 however small, sea. way yards swung
 round; starboard larboard, continued tack; now beat
 head sea; pushed it; the
 while, masts yards thickly clustered men, three
 tall cherry trees, boys cherrying among boughs.
 
still halting course winding, woeful way, plainly
 saw ship wept spray, still remained without
 comfort. rachel, weeping children, were
 not.
 

chapter 129. cabin.
 
(_ahab moving go deck; pip catches hand follow._)
 
“lad, lad, tell thee thou must follow ahab now. hour is
 coming ahab scare thee him, yet thee
 him. thee, poor lad, feel curing my
 malady. like cures like; hunt, malady becomes most
 desired health. thou abide here, shall serve thee,
 thou wert captain. aye, lad, thou shalt sit own
 screwed chair; another screw it, thou must be.”
 
“no, no, no! ye whole body, sir; ye use poor for
 one lost leg; tread upon me, sir; ask more, remain
 part ye.”
 
“oh! spite million villains, makes bigot fadeless
 fidelity man!—and black! crazy!—but methinks like-cures-like
 applies too; grows sane again.”
 
“they tell me, sir, stubb desert poor little pip, whose
 drowned bones now show white, blackness living skin.
 will never desert ye, sir, stubb him. sir, must go with
 ye.”
 
“if thou speakest thus much more, ahab’s purpose keels him.
 tell thee no; be.”
 
“oh good master, master, master!
 
“weep so, will murder thee! care, ahab mad.
 listen, thou wilt often hear ivory foot upon deck, still
 know there. now quit thee. thy hand!—met! true art
 thou, lad, circumference centre. so: god ever bless
 thee; come that,—god ever save thee, let will
 befall.”
 
(_ahab goes; pip steps one step forward._)
 
“here instant stood; stand air,—but i’m alone. now
 even poor pip endure it, he’s missing. pip! pip!
 ding, dong, ding! who’s seen pip? must here; let’s try the
 door. what? neither lock, bolt, bar; yet there’s opening
 it. must spell; told stay here: aye, told me
 screwed chair mine. here, then, i’ll seat me, the
 transom, ship’s full middle, keel three masts

 great admirals sometimes sit table, lord rows of
 captains lieutenants. ha! what’s this? epaulets! epaulets! the
 epaulets come crowding! pass round decanters; glad see ye;
 fill up, monsieurs! odd feeling, now, black boy’s host
 white men gold lace upon coats!—monsieurs, ye seen
 one pip?—a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and
 cowardly! jumped whale-boat once;—seen him? no! well then, fill
 again, captains, let’s drink shame upon cowards! name no
 names. shame upon them! put one foot upon table. shame upon all
 cowards.—hist! there, hear ivory—oh, master! master! am
 indeed down-hearted walk me. i’ll stay, though
 stern strikes rocks; bulge through; oysters come to
 join me.”
 

chapter 130. hat.
 
now proper time place, long wide a
 preliminary cruise, ahab,—all whaling waters swept—seemed have
 chased foe ocean-fold, slay securely there;
 now, found hard latitude longitude
 tormenting wound inflicted; now vessel had
 spoken day preceding actually encountered
 moby dick;—and now successive meetings various ships
 contrastingly concurred show demoniac indifference which
 white whale tore hunters, whether sinning sinned against;
 now lurked something old man’s eyes, which
 hardly sufferable feeble souls see. unsetting
 polar star, livelong, arctic, six months’ night
 sustains piercing, steady, central gaze; ahab’s purpose now
 fixedly gleamed upon constant midnight gloomy crew. it
 domineered so, bodings, doubts, misgivings,
 fears, fain hide beneath souls, sprout forth a
 single spear leaf.
 
foreshadowing interval too, humor, forced natural,
 vanished. stubb strove raise smile; starbuck more
 strove check one. alike, joy sorrow, hope fear, seemed
 ground finest dust, powdered, time, clamped
 mortar ahab’s iron soul. like machines, dumbly moved the
 deck, ever conscious old man’s despot eye them.
 
deeply scan secret confidential hours; when
 thought glance one him; seen that
 even ahab’s eyes awed crew’s, inscrutable parsee’s glance
 awed his; somehow, least, wild way, times affected it.
 added, gliding strangeness began invest thin fedallah
 now; ceaseless shudderings shook him; men looked dubious
 him; half uncertain, seemed, whether indeed mortal
 substance, else tremulous shadow cast upon deck unseen
 being’s body. shadow always hovering there. by
 night, even, fedallah ever certainly known slumber, go
 below. stand still hours: never sat leaned; wan
 wondrous eyes plainly say—we two watchmen never rest.
 
nor, time, night day mariners now step upon the
 deck, unless ahab them; either standing pivot-hole,
 exactly pacing planks two undeviating limits,—the
 main-mast mizen; else saw standing the
 cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon deck, step;
 hat slouched heavily eyes; however motionless he
 stood, however days nights added on, swung
 hammock; yet hidden beneath slouching hat, never
 tell unerringly whether, this, eyes really closed at
 times; whether still intently scanning them; matter,
 though stood scuttle whole hour stretch, and
 unheeded night-damp gathered beads dew upon stone-carved
 coat hat. clothes night wet, next day’s
 sunshine dried upon him; so, day day, night night;
 went beneath planks; whatever wanted cabin
 thing sent for.
 
ate open air; is, two meals,—breakfast and
 dinner: supper never touched; reaped beard; darkly
 grew gnarled, unearthed roots trees blown over, still
 grow idly naked base, though perished upper verdure. but
 though whole life now become one watch deck; though the
 parsee’s mystic watch without intermission own; yet these
 two never seemed speak—one man other—unless long intervals
 passing unmomentous matter made necessary. though potent
 spell seemed secretly join twain; openly, awe-struck
 crew, seemed pole-like asunder. day chanced speak
 one word; night, dumb men both, far concerned the
 slightest verbal interchange. times, longest hours, without a
 single hail, stood far parted starlight; ahab his
 scuttle, parsee mainmast; still fixedly gazing upon each
 other; parsee ahab saw forethrown shadow, ahab the
 parsee abandoned substance.
 
yet, somehow, ahab—in proper self, daily, hourly,
 every instant, commandingly revealed subordinates,—ahab
 seemed independent lord; parsee slave. still both
 seemed yoked together, unseen tyrant driving them; lean
 shade siding solid rib. parsee may, rib and
 keel solid ahab.
 
first faintest glimmering dawn, iron voice heard
 aft,—“man mast-heads!”—and day, till after
 sunset twilight, voice every hour, striking
 helmsman’s bell, heard—“what d’ye see?—sharp! sharp!”
 
three four days slided by, meeting the
 children-seeking rachel; spout yet seen; monomaniac
 old man seemed distrustful crew’s fidelity; least, nearly
 except pagan harpooneers; seemed doubt, even, whether
 stubb flask might willingly overlook sight sought. but
 suspicions really his, sagaciously refrained from
 verbally expressing them, however actions might seem hint them.
 
“i will first sight whale myself,”—he said. “aye! ahab
 must doubloon!” hands rigged nest of
 basketed bowlines; sending hand aloft, single sheaved
 block, secure main-mast head, received two ends the
 downward-reeved rope; attaching one basket prepared pin
 end, order fasten rail. done, with
 end yet hand standing beside pin, looked round
 upon crew, sweeping one other; pausing glance long
 upon daggoo, queequeg, tashtego; shunning fedallah; then
 settling firm relying eye upon chief mate, said,—“take the
 rope, sir—i give thy hands, starbuck.” arranging his
 person basket, gave word hoist his
 perch, starbuck one secured rope last; and
 afterwards stood near it. thus, one hand clinging round the
 royal mast, ahab gazed abroad upon miles miles,—ahead,
 astern, side, that,—within wide expanded circle commanded
 great height.
 
working hands lofty almost isolated place in
 rigging, chances afford foothold, sailor is
 hoisted spot, sustained rope; these
 circumstances, fastened end deck always given strict
 charge one man special watch it. such
 wilderness running rigging, whose various different relations
 aloft always infallibly discerned seen at
 deck; deck-ends ropes every few
 minutes cast fastenings, natural
 fatality, if, unprovided constant watchman, hoisted sailor
 carelessness crew cast adrift fall all
 swooping sea. ahab’s proceedings matter not
 unusual; strange thing seemed be, starbuck,
 almost one man ever ventured oppose with
 anything slightest degree approaching decision—one those
 too, whose faithfulness look-out seemed doubt
 somewhat;—it strange, man select
 watchman; freely giving whole life otherwise
 distrusted person’s hands.
 
now, first time ahab perched aloft; ere ten
 minutes; one red-billed savage sea-hawks often fly
 incommodiously close round manned mast-heads whalemen these
 latitudes; one birds came wheeling screaming round his
 head maze untrackably swift circlings. darted a
 thousand feet straight air; spiralized downwards, and
 went eddying round head.
 
gaze fixed upon dim distant horizon, ahab seemed
 mark wild bird; nor, indeed, one else marked
 much, uncommon circumstance; now almost least
 heedful eye seemed see sort cunning meaning almost every
 sight.
 
“your hat, hat, sir!” suddenly cried sicilian seaman, who
 posted mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind ahab, though
 somewhat lower level, deep gulf air dividing
 them.
 
already sable wing old man’s eyes; long
 hooked bill head: scream, black hawk darted away with
 prize.
 
eagle flew thrice round tarquin’s head, removing cap replace
 it, thereupon tanaquil, wife, declared tarquin be
 king rome. replacing cap omen
 accounted good. ahab’s hat never restored; wild hawk flew on
 it; far advance prow: last disappeared;
 point disappearance, minute black spot was
 dimly discerned, falling vast height sea.
 

chapter 131. pequod meets delight.
 
intense pequod sailed on; rolling waves days went by; the
 life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; another ship, miserably
 misnamed delight, descried. drew nigh, eyes were
 fixed upon broad beams, called shears, which, some
 whaling-ships, cross quarter-deck height eight nine
 feet; serving carry spare, unrigged, disabled boats.
 
upon stranger’s shears beheld shattered, white ribs, and
 splintered planks, whale-boat; you
 now saw wreck, plainly see peeled,
 half-unhinged, bleaching skeleton horse.
 
“hast seen white whale?”
 
“look!” replied hollow-cheeked captain taffrail; with
 trumpet pointed wreck.
 
“hast killed him?”
 
“the harpoon yet forged ever will that,” answered the
 other, sadly glancing upon rounded hammock deck, whose
 gathered sides noiseless sailors busy sewing together.
 
“not forged!” snatching perth’s levelled iron crotch, ahab
 held out, exclaiming—“look ye, nantucketer; hand hold
 death! tempered blood, tempered lightning these
 barbs; swear temper triply hot place behind the
 fin, white whale feels accursed life!”
 
“then god keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing the
 hammock—“i bury one five stout men, alive only
 yesterday; dead ere night. _that_ one bury; rest

clear steel-blue day. firmaments air were

hither, thither, high, glided snow-white wings small,
 unspeckled birds; gentle thoughts feminine air;
 fro deeps, far bottomless blue, rushed

though thus contrasting within, contrast shades and

chapter 133. chase—first day.
 
night, mid-watch, old man—as wont at
 intervals—stepped forth scuttle leaned, went
 pivot-hole, suddenly thrust face fiercely, snuffing
 air sagacious ship’s dog will, drawing nigh some
 barbarous isle. declared whale must near. soon that
 peculiar odor, sometimes great distance given forth living
 sperm whale, palpable watch; mariner
 surprised when, inspecting compass, dog-vane,
 ascertaining precise bearing odor nearly as
 possible, ahab rapidly ordered ship’s course slightly
 altered, sail shortened.
 
acute policy dictating movements sufficiently vindicated
 daybreak, sight long sleek directly and
 lengthwise ahead, smooth oil, resembling pleated watery
 wrinkles bordering it, polished metallic-like marks swift
 tide-rip, mouth deep, rapid stream.
 
“man mast-heads! call hands!”
 
thundering butts three clubbed handspikes forecastle
 deck, daggoo roused sleepers judgment claps they
 seemed exhale scuttle, instantaneously appear
 clothes hands.
 
“what d’ye see?” cried ahab, flattening face sky.
 
“nothing, nothing sir!” sound hailing reply.
 
“t’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow aloft, sides!”
 
sail set, now cast loose life-line, reserved for
 swaying main royal-mast head; moments were
 hoisting thither, when, two thirds way aloft, and
 peering ahead horizontal vacancy the
 main-top-sail top-gallant-sail, raised gull-like cry the
 air. “there blows!—there blows! hump like snow-hill! is
 moby dick!”
 
fired cry seemed simultaneously taken three
 look-outs, men deck rushed rigging behold famous
 whale long pursuing. ahab now gained final
 perch, feet look-outs, tashtego standing just
 beneath cap top-gallant-mast, indian’s
 head almost level ahab’s heel. height whale
 now seen mile ahead, every roll revealing
 high sparkling hump, regularly jetting silent spout into
 air. credulous mariners seemed silent spout they
 long ago beheld moonlit atlantic indian oceans.
 
“and none ye see before?” cried ahab, hailing perched men
 around him.
 
“i saw almost instant, sir, captain ahab did, i
 cried out,” said tashtego.
 
“not instant; same—no, doubloon mine, fate
 reserved doubloon me. _i_ only; none ye raised
 white whale first. blows!—there blows!—there she
 blows! again!—there again!” cried, long-drawn, lingering,
 methodic tones, attuned gradual prolongings whale’s
 visible jets. “he’s going sound! stunsails! down
 top-gallant-sails! stand three boats. mr. starbuck, remember, stay
 board, keep ship. helm there! luff, luff point! so;
 steady, man, steady! go flukes! no, no; black water! all
 ready boats there? stand by, stand by! lower me, mr. starbuck;
 lower, lower,—quick, quicker!” slid air deck.
 
“he heading straight leeward, sir,” cried stubb, “right away from
 us; seen ship yet.”
 
“be dumb, man! stand braces! hard helm!—brace up!
 shiver her!—shiver her!—so; well that! boats, boats!”
 
soon boats starbuck’s dropped; boat-sails
 set—all paddles plying; rippling swiftness, shooting to
 leeward; ahab heading onset. pale, death-glimmer lit up
 fedallah’s sunken eyes; hideous motion gnawed mouth.
 
like noiseless nautilus shells, light prows sped sea;
 slowly neared foe. neared him, ocean grew
 still smooth; seemed drawing carpet waves; seemed a
 noon-meadow, serenely spread. length breathless hunter
 came nigh seemingly unsuspecting prey, entire dazzling

 greenish foam. saw vast, involved wrinkles slightly
 projecting head beyond. it, far soft turkish-rugged

 behind, blue waters interchangeably flowed moving
 valley steady wake; either hand bright bubbles arose and
 danced side. broken light toes of
 hundreds gay fowl softly feathering sea, alternate their
 fitful flight; like flag-staff rising painted hull
 argosy, tall shattered pole recent lance projected
 white whale’s back; intervals one cloud of
 soft-toed fowls hovering, fro skimming like canopy over
 fish, silently perched rocked pole, long tail
 feathers streaming like pennons.
 
gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness repose swiftness, invested
 gliding whale. white bull jupiter swimming away with
 ravished europa clinging graceful horns; lovely, leering
 eyes sideways intent upon maid; smooth bewitching fleetness,
 rippling straight nuptial bower crete; jove, that
 great majesty supreme! surpass glorified white whale so
 divinely swam.
 
soft side—coincident parted swell, once
 leaving him, flowed wide away—on bright side, whale
 shed enticings. wonder among hunters who
 namelessly transported allured serenity, ventured
 assail it; fatally found quietude vesture of
 tornadoes. yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, all
 first time eye thee, matter many way
 thou may’st bejuggled destroyed before.
 
thus, serene tranquillities tropical sea, among
 waves whose hand-clappings suspended exceeding rapture, moby
 dick moved on, still withholding sight full terrors his
 submerged trunk, entirely hiding wrenched hideousness jaw.
 soon fore part slowly rose water; an
 instant whole marbleized body formed high arch, like virginia’s
 natural bridge, warningly waving bannered flukes air,
 grand god revealed himself, sounded, went sight.
 hoveringly halting, dipping wing, white sea-fowls
 longingly lingered agitated pool left.
 
oars apeak, paddles down, sheets sails adrift,
 three boats now stilly floated, awaiting moby dick’s reappearance.
 
“an hour,” said ahab, standing rooted boat’s stern; gazed
 beyond whale’s place, towards dim blue spaces wide wooing
 vacancies leeward. instant; eyes seemed
 whirling round head swept watery circle. breeze
 now freshened; began swell.
 
“the birds!—the birds!” cried tashtego.
 
long indian file, herons take wing, white birds now
 flying towards ahab’s boat; within yards began
 fluttering water there, wheeling round round, joyous,
 expectant cries. vision keener man’s; ahab could
 discover sign sea. suddenly peered down
 depths, profoundly saw white living spot bigger a
 white weasel, wonderful celerity uprising, magnifying it
 rose, till turned, plainly revealed two long
 crooked rows white, glistening teeth, floating the
 undiscoverable bottom. moby dick’s open mouth scrolled jaw;
 vast, shadowed bulk still half blending blue sea.
 glittering mouth yawned beneath boat like open-doored marble
 tomb; giving one sidelong sweep steering oar, ahab whirled
 craft aside tremendous apparition. then, calling upon
 fedallah change places him, went forward bows, and
 seizing perth’s harpoon, commanded crew grasp oars and
 stand stern.
 
now, reason timely spinning round boat upon axis,
 bow, anticipation, made face whale’s head yet
 water. perceiving stratagem, moby dick, that
 malicious intelligence ascribed him, sidelingly transplanted
 himself, were, instant, shooting pleated head
 lengthwise beneath boat.
 
through; every plank rib, thrilled for
 instant, whale obliquely lying back, manner a
 biting shark, slowly feelingly taking bows full within his
 mouth, long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high into
 open air, one teeth caught row-lock. bluish
 pearl-white inside jaw within six inches ahab’s
 head, reached higher that. attitude white whale
 now shook slight cedar mildly cruel cat mouse. with
 unastonished eyes fedallah gazed, crossed arms; the
 tiger-yellow crew tumbling other’s heads gain the
 uttermost stern.
 
now, elastic gunwales springing out, the
 whale dallied doomed craft devilish way; his
 body submerged beneath boat, darted from
 bows, bows almost inside him, were; while
 boats involuntarily paused, quick crisis
 impossible withstand, monomaniac ahab, furious with
 tantalizing vicinity foe, placed alive and
 helpless jaws hated; frenzied this, seized
 long bone naked hands, wildly strove wrench from
 gripe. now thus vainly strove, jaw slipped him; the
 frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, snapped, jaws, like an
 enormous shears, sliding aft, bit craft completely in
 twain, locked fast sea, midway the
 two floating wrecks. floated aside, broken ends drooping, the
 crew stern-wreck clinging gunwales, striving hold
 fast oars lash across.
 
preluding moment, ere boat yet snapped, ahab, first
 perceive whale’s intent, crafty upraising head, a
 movement loosed hold time; moment hand had
 made one final effort push boat bite. only
 slipping whale’s mouth, tilting sideways as
 slipped, boat shaken hold jaw; spilled him
 it, leaned push; fell flat-faced upon the
 sea.
 
ripplingly withdrawing prey, moby dick now lay little
 distance, vertically thrusting oblong white head the
 billows; time slowly revolving whole spindled body;
 vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty feet

 dazzlingly broke it; vindictively tossing shivered spray

*this motion peculiar sperm whale. receives its
 designation (pitchpoling) likened preliminary

 pitchpoling, previously described. motion whale must best
 comprehensively view whatever objects may encircling him.
 
soon resuming horizontal attitude, moby dick swam swiftly round
 round wrecked crew; sideways churning water vengeful
 wake, lashing still another deadly
 assault. sight splintered boat seemed madden him, the
 blood grapes mulberries cast antiochus’s elephants the
 book maccabees. meanwhile ahab half smothered foam the
 whale’s insolent tail, much cripple swim,—though he
 still keep afloat, even heart whirlpool that;
 helpless ahab’s head seen, like tossed bubble least
 chance shock might burst. boat’s fragmentary stern, fedallah
 incuriously mildly eyed him; clinging crew, other
 drifting end, succor him; enough to
 look themselves. revolvingly appalling white whale’s
 aspect, planetarily swift ever-contracting circles made,
 seemed horizontally swooping upon them. though other
 boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still dared pull into
 eddy strike, lest signal instant
 destruction jeopardized castaways, ahab all; that
 case hope escape. straining eyes, then,
 remained outer edge direful zone, whose centre had
 now become old man’s head.
 
meantime, beginning descried ship’s
 mast heads; squaring yards, borne upon scene;
 now nigh, ahab water hailed her!—“sail on

 whelmed time. struggling again, chancing
 rise towering crest, shouted,—“sail whale!—drive him
 off!”
 
pequod’s prows pointed; breaking charmed circle,
 effectually parted white whale victim. sullenly
 swam off, boats flew rescue.
 
dragged stubb’s boat blood-shot, blinded eyes, white
 brine caking wrinkles; long tension ahab’s bodily
 strength crack, helplessly yielded body’s doom: a

“the harpoon,” said ahab, half way rising, draggingly leaning on
 one bended arm—“is safe?”
 
“aye, sir, darted; it,” said stubb, showing it.
 
“lay me;—any missing men?”
 
“one, two, three, four, five;—there five oars, sir, are
 five men.”
 
“that’s good.—help me, man; wish stand. so, so, see him! there!

 whale, seemed treble-banked every fin; swimming with

 circumstances, pushed on, chase prove indefinitely
 prolonged, hopeless one; crew endure long
 period, unintermitted, intense straining oar; thing
 barely tolerable one brief vicissitude. ship itself,
 then, sometimes happens, offered promising intermediate
 means overtaking chase. accordingly, boats now made her,
 soon swayed cranes—the two parts wrecked
 boat previously secured her—and hoisting everything
 side, stacking canvas high up, sideways
 outstretching stun-sails, like double-jointed wings an
 albatross; pequod bore leeward wake moby-dick. at
 well known, methodic intervals, whale’s glittering spout was
 regularly announced manned mast-heads; be
 reported just gone down, ahab take time, pacing
 deck, binnacle-watch hand, soon last second the
 allotted hour expired, voice heard.—“whose doubloon now?
 d’ye see him?” reply was, no, sir! straightway commanded
 lift perch. way day wore on; ahab, now
 aloft motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing planks.
 
thus walking, uttering sound, except hail men
 aloft, bid hoist sail still higher, spread one a
 still greater breadth—thus fro pacing, beneath slouched hat,
 every turn passed wrecked boat, dropped
 upon quarter-deck, lay reversed; broken bow shattered

stubb saw pause; perhaps intending, vainly, though, to
 evince unabated fortitude, thus keep valiant place in
 captain’s mind, advanced, eyeing wreck exclaimed—“the
 thistle ass refused; pricked mouth keenly, sir; ha! ha!”
 
“what soulless thing laughs wreck? man, man! did
 know thee brave fearless fire (and mechanical) could
 swear thou wert poltroon. groan laugh heard a

“aye, sir,” said starbuck drawing near, “’tis solemn sight; omen,
 ill one.”
 
“omen? omen?—the dictionary! gods think speak outright to
 man, will honorably speak outright; shake heads, and
 give old wives’ darkling hint.—begone! ye two opposite poles
 one thing; starbuck stubb reversed, stubb starbuck; ye

day nearly done; hem golden robe rustling.
 soon, almost dark, look-out men still remained unset.
 
“can’t see spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried voice air.
 
“how heading last seen?”
 
“as before, sir,—straight leeward.”
 
“good! will travel slower now ’tis night. royals and

saying, placed half way within scuttle, and

“see nothing, sir.”

 timid prairie hares scatter bounding bison. hand
 fate snatched souls; stirring perils the
 previous day; rack past night’s suspense; fixed,
 unfearing, blind, reckless way wild craft went plunging
 towards flying mark; things, hearts bowled
 along. wind made great bellies sails, rushed the
 vessel arms invisible irresistible; seemed symbol of
 unseen agency enslaved race.

rigging lived. mast-heads, like tops tall palms, were

 hand, reached forth impatient wavings; others,
 shading eyes vivid sunlight, sat far rocking
 yards; spars full bearing mortals, ready ripe for
 fate. ah! still strove infinite blueness to
 seek thing might destroy them!
 
“why sing ye him, ye see him?” cried ahab, when, after
 lapse minutes since first cry, heard.
 “sway up, men; ye deceived; moby dick casts one odd
 jet way, disappears.”
 
even so; headlong eagerness, men mistaken some
 thing whale-spout, event soon proved; for
 hardly ahab reached perch; hardly rope belayed its
 pin deck, struck key-note orchestra, made the
 air vibrate combined discharges rifles. triumphant

“there breaches! breaches!” cry, his

“aye, breach last sun, moby dick!” cried ahab, “thy hour

unmindful tedious rope-ladders shrouds, men, like
 shooting stars, slid deck, isolated backstays and
 halyards; ahab, less dartingly, still rapidly dropped

“lower away,” cried, soon reached boat—a spare one,

 legs upwards escape dreaded jaws sharks; stubb was
 lustily singing one ladle up; old
 man’s line—now parting—admitted pulling creamy pool to
 rescue could;—in wild simultaneousness thousand
 concreted perils,—ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn towards
 heaven invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly
 sea, white whale dashed broad forehead its
 bottom, sent it, turning over, air; till fell
 again—gunwale downwards—and ahab men struggled under
 it, like seals sea-side cave.
 
first uprising momentum whale—modifying direction he
 struck surface—involuntarily launched along it, little
 distance centre destruction made; his
 back it, now lay moment slowly feeling flukes from
 side side; whenever stray oar, bit plank, least chip or
 crumb boats touched skin, tail swiftly drew back, and
 came sideways smiting sea. soon, satisfied work
 time done, pushed pleated forehead the

 leeward way traveller’s methodic pace.
 
before, attentive ship descried whole fight, again
 came bearing rescue, dropping boat, picked the
 floating mariners, tubs, oars, whatever else caught at,
 safely landed decks. sprained shoulders, wrists,
 ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons lances;
 inextricable intricacies rope; shattered oars planks; these
 there; fatal even serious ill seemed befallen
 one. fedallah day before, ahab now found grimly
 clinging boat’s broken half, afforded comparatively easy
 float; exhaust previous day’s mishap.
 
helped deck, eyes fastened upon him; as
 instead standing still half-hung upon shoulder of
 starbuck, thus far foremost assist him. ivory
 leg snapped off, leaving one short sharp splinter.
 
“aye, aye, starbuck, ’tis sweet lean sometimes, leaner he
 will; old ahab leaned oftener has.”
 
“the ferrule stood, sir,” said carpenter, now coming up; “i
 put good work leg.”
 
“but bones broken, sir, hope,” said stubb true concern.
 
“aye! splintered pieces, stubb!—d’ye see it.—but even a
 broken bone, old ahab untouched; account living bone of
 mine one jot me, dead one that’s lost. white whale,

 inaccessible being. can lead touch yonder floor, mast scrape

“dead leeward, sir.”
 
“up helm, then; pile sail again, ship keepers! rest of
 spare boats rig them—mr. starbuck away, muster boat’s
 crews.”
 
“let first help thee towards bulwarks, sir.”
 
“oh, oh, oh! splinter gores now! accursed fate! the
 unconquerable captain soul craven mate!”
 
“sir?”
 
“my body, man, thee. give something cane—there, that
 shivered lance will do. muster men. surely seen yet.

“the parsee!” cried stubb—“he must caught in——”
 
“the black vomit wrench thee!—run ye above, alow, cabin,
 forecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”
 
quickly returned tidings parsee was
 nowhere found.
 
“aye, sir,” said stubb—“caught among tangles line—i thought

“_my_ line! _my_ line? gone?—gone? means little word?—what
 death-knell rings it, old ahab shakes belfry.
 harpoon, too!—toss litter there,—d’ye see it?—the forged
 iron, men, white whale’s—no, no, no,—blistered fool! hand did
 dart it!—’tis fish!—aloft there! keep nailed—quick!—all

 irons, irons!—hoist royals higher—a pull the
 sheets!—helm there! steady, steady life! i’ll ten times girdle
 unmeasured globe; yea dive straight it, i’ll slay

“great god! one single instant show thyself,” cried starbuck;
 “never, never wilt thou capture him, old man—in jesus’ name of
 this, that’s worse devil’s madness. two days chased; twice stove
 splinters; thy leg snatched thee; thy evil
 shadow gone—all good angels mobbing thee warnings:—what more
 wouldst thou have?—shall keep chasing murderous fish till he
 swamps last man? shall dragged bottom the
 sea? shall towed infernal world? oh, oh,—impiety
 blasphemy hunt more!”
 
“starbuck, late i’ve felt strangely moved thee; ever since that
 hour saw—thou know’st what, one another’s eyes. this
 matter whale, front thy face palm this
 hand—a lipless, unfeatured blank. ahab ever ahab, man. this
 whole act’s immutably decreed. ’twas rehearsed thee billion
 years ocean rolled. fool! fates’ lieutenant; act
 orders. look thou, underling! thou obeyest mine.—stand round
 me, men. ye see old man cut stump; leaning shivered
 lance; propped lonely foot. ’tis ahab—his body’s part; but
 ahab’s soul’s centipede, moves upon hundred legs. feel
 strained, half stranded, ropes tow dismasted frigates a
 gale; may look so. ere break, ye’ll hear crack; till
 ye hear _that_, know ahab’s hawser tows purpose yet. believe
 ye, men, things called omens? laugh aloud, cry encore!
 ere drown, drowning things will twice rise surface;
 rise again, sink evermore. moby dick—two days he’s
 floated—tomorrow will third. aye, men, he’ll rise more,—but
 spout last! d’ye feel brave men, brave?”
 
“as fearless fire,” cried stubb.
 
“and mechanical,” muttered ahab. men went forward, he
 muttered on: “the things called omens! yesterday talked same
 starbuck there, concerning broken boat. oh! valiantly seek
 drive others’ hearts what’s clinched fast mine!—the
 parsee—the parsee!—gone, gone? go before:—but still was
 seen ere perish—how’s that?—there’s riddle now
 might baffle lawyers backed ghosts whole line of
 judges:—like hawk’s beak pecks brain. _i’ll_, _i’ll_ solve it,
 though!”
 
dusk descended, whale still sight leeward.
 
sail shortened, everything passed nearly on
 previous night; only, sound hammers, hum the
 grindstone heard till nearly daylight, men toiled by
 lanterns complete careful rigging spare boats and
 sharpening fresh weapons morrow. meantime, broken
 keel ahab’s wrecked craft carpenter made another leg; while
 still night before, slouched ahab stood fixed within his
 scuttle; hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward its
 dial; sat due eastward earliest sun.
 

chapter 135. chase.—third day.
 
morning third day dawned fair fresh, the
 solitary night-man fore-mast-head relieved crowds the
 daylight look-outs, dotted every mast almost every spar.
 
“d’ye see him?” cried ahab; whale yet sight.
 
“in infallible wake, though; follow wake, that’s all. helm
 there; steady, thou goest, hast going. lovely day
 again! new-made world, made summer-house the
 angels, morning first throwing open them, a
 fairer day dawn upon world. here’s food thought, had
 ahab time think; ahab never thinks; feels, feels, feels;
 _that’s_ tingling enough mortal man! think’s audacity. god only
 right privilege. thinking is, be, coolness
 calmness; poor hearts throb, poor brains beat too
 much that. yet, i’ve sometimes thought brain very
 calm—frozen calm, old skull cracks so, like glass the
 contents turned ice, shiver it. still hair growing
 now; moment growing, heat must breed it; no, it’s like
 sort common grass will grow anywhere, earthy
 clefts greenland ice vesuvius lava. wild winds blow
 it; whip torn shreds split sails lash the
 tossed ship cling to. vile wind doubt blown ere this
 prison corridors cells, wards hospitals, and
 ventilated them, now comes blowing hither innocent fleeces.
 upon it!—it’s tainted. wind, i’d blow a
 wicked, miserable world. i’d crawl somewhere cave, slink
 there. yet, ’tis noble heroic thing, wind! ever
 conquered it? every fight last bitterest blow. run
 tilting it, run it. ha! coward wind that
 strikes stark naked men, will stand receive single blow.
 even ahab braver thing—a nobler thing _that_. now the
 wind body; things exasperate and
 outrage mortal man, things bodiless, bodiless as
 objects, agents. there’s special, cunning, oh, a
 malicious difference! yet, say again, swear now, that
 there’s something glorious gracious wind. warm
 trade winds, least, clear heavens blow straight on, in
 strong steadfast, vigorous mildness; veer mark,
 however baser currents may turn tack, mightiest
 mississippies land swift swerve about, uncertain go
 last. eternal poles! trades directly
 blow good ship on; trades, something like them—something so
 unchangeable, full strong, blow keeled soul along! it!
 aloft there! d’ye see?”
 
“nothing, sir.”
 
“nothing! noon hand! doubloon goes a-begging! see sun!
 aye, aye, must so. i’ve oversailed him. how, got start? aye,
 he’s chasing _me_ now; i, _him_—that’s bad; might known it,
 too. fool! lines—the harpoons he’s towing. aye, aye, run him
 last night. about! about! come down, ye, regular look
 outs! man braces!”
 
steering done, wind somewhat pequod’s
 quarter, now pointed reverse direction, braced
 ship sailed hard upon breeze rechurned cream own
 white wake.
 
“against wind now steers open jaw,” murmured starbuck to
 himself, coiled new-hauled main-brace upon rail. “god
 keep us, already bones feel damp within me, inside
 wet flesh. misdoubt disobey god obeying him!”
 
“stand sway up!” cried ahab, advancing hempen basket.
 “we meet soon.”
 
“aye, aye, sir,” straightway starbuck ahab’s bidding, once
 ahab swung high.
 
whole hour now passed; gold-beaten ages. time now held
 long breaths keen suspense. last, three points the
 weather bow, ahab descried spout again, instantly the
 three mast-heads three shrieks went tongues fire had
 voiced it.
 
“forehead forehead meet thee, third time, moby dick! deck
 there!—brace sharper up; crowd wind’s eye. he’s far
 lower yet, mr. starbuck. sails shake! stand that
 helmsman top-maul! so, so; travels fast, must down. but
 let one good round look aloft sea; there’s
 time that. old, old sight, yet somehow young; aye, and
 changed wink since first saw it, boy, sand-hills of
 nantucket! same!—the same!—the noah me. there’s a
 soft shower leeward. lovely leewardings! must lead
 somewhere—to something else common land, palmy the
 palms. leeward! white whale goes way; look windward, then;
 better bitterer quarter. good bye, good bye, old
 mast-head! what’s this?—green? aye, tiny mosses warped cracks.
 green weather stains ahab’s head! there’s difference now
 man’s old age matter’s. aye, old mast, grow old
 together; sound hulls, though, not, ship? aye, minus a
 leg, that’s all. heaven dead wood better live
 flesh every way. can’t compare it; i’ve known ships
 made dead trees outlast lives men made vital
 stuff vital fathers. what’s said? still go before
 me, pilot; yet seen again? where? will eyes at
 bottom sea, supposing descend endless stairs? and
 night i’ve sailing him, wherever sink to. aye,
 aye, like many thou told’st direful truth touching thyself, o
 parsee; but, ahab, thy shot fell short. good-bye, mast-head—keep
 good eye upon whale, i’m gone. we’ll talk to-morrow,
 nay, to-night, white whale lies there, tied head and
 tail.”
 
gave word; still gazing round him, steadily lowered
 cloven blue air deck.
 
due time boats lowered; standing shallop’s
 stern, ahab just hovered upon point descent, waved the
 mate,—who held one tackle-ropes deck—and bade pause.
 
“starbuck!”
 
“sir?”
 
“for third time soul’s ship starts upon voyage, starbuck.”
 
“aye, sir, thou wilt so.”
 
“some ships sail ports, ever afterwards missing,
 starbuck!”
 
“truth, sir: saddest truth.”
 
“some men die ebb tide; low water; full the
 flood;—and feel now like billow that’s one crested comb,
 starbuck. old;—shake hands me, man.”
 
hands met; eyes fastened; starbuck’s tears glue.
 
“oh, captain, captain!—noble heart—go not—go not!—see, it’s a
 brave man weeps; great agony persuasion then!”
 
“lower away!”—cried ahab, tossing mate’s arm him. “stand by
 crew!”
 
instant boat pulling round close stern.
 
“the sharks! sharks!” cried voice low cabin-window
 there; “o master, master, come back!”
 
ahab heard nothing; voice high-lifted then; the
 boat leaped on.
 
yet voice spake true; scarce pushed ship, when
 numbers sharks, seemingly rising dark waters beneath
 hull, maliciously snapped blades oars, every time
 dipped water; way accompanied boat with
 bites. thing uncommonly happening whale-boats
 swarming seas; sharks times apparently following them
 prescient way vultures hover banners of
 marching regiments east. first sharks that
 observed pequod since white whale first
 descried; whether ahab’s crew such
 tiger-yellow barbarians, therefore flesh musky the
 senses sharks—a matter sometimes well known affect
 them,—however was, seemed follow one boat without
 molesting others.
 
“heart wrought steel!” murmured starbuck gazing side, and
 following eyes receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly
 sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, followed by
 them, open-mouthed chase; critical third day?—for
 three days flow together one continuous intense pursuit; be
 sure first morning, second noon, third the
 evening end thing—be end may. oh! god!
 shoots me, leaves deadly calm, yet
 expectant,—fixed top shudder! future things swim me,
 empty outlines skeletons; past somehow grown dim.
 mary, girl! thou fadest pale glories behind me; boy! seem see
 thy eyes grown wondrous blue. strangest problems life seem
 clearing; clouds sweep between—is journey’s end coming? legs
 feel faint; like footed day. feel thy heart,—beats
 yet? stir thyself, starbuck!—stave off—move, move! speak
 aloud!—mast-head there! see ye boy’s hand hill?—crazed;—aloft
 there!—keep thy keenest eye upon boats:—mark well whale!—ho!
 again!—drive hawk! see! pecks—he tears vane”—pointing
 red flag flying main-truck—“ha! soars away with
 it!—where’s old man now? see’st thou sight, oh ahab!—shudder,
 shudder!”
 
boats gone far, signal mast-heads—a
 downward pointed arm, ahab knew whale sounded; but
 intending near next rising, held way a
 little sideways vessel; becharmed crew maintaining the
 profoundest silence, head-beat waves hammered hammered
 opposing bow.
 
“drive, drive nails, oh ye waves! uttermost heads
 drive in! ye strike thing without lid; coffin and
 hearse can mine:—and hemp can kill me! ha! ha!”
 
suddenly waters around slowly swelled broad circles; then
 quickly upheaved, sideways sliding submerged berg ice,
 swiftly rising surface. low rumbling sound heard; a
 subterraneous hum; held breaths; bedraggled with
 trailing ropes, harpoons, lances, vast form shot lengthwise,
 obliquely sea. shrouded thin drooping veil mist,
 hovered moment rainbowed air; fell swamping
 back deep. crushed thirty feet upwards, waters flashed for
 instant like heaps fountains, brokenly sank shower of
 flakes, leaving circling surface creamed like new milk round the
 marble trunk whale.
 
“give way!” cried ahab oarsmen, boats darted forward to
 attack; maddened yesterday’s fresh irons corroded in
 him, moby dick seemed combinedly possessed angels fell
 heaven. wide tiers welded tendons overspreading broad
 white forehead, beneath transparent skin, looked knitted together;
 head on, came churning tail among boats; more
 flailed apart; spilling irons lances two
 mates’ boats, dashing one side upper part bows,
 leaving ahab’s almost without scar.
 
daggoo queequeg stopping strained planks; the
 whale swimming them, turned, showed one entire flank he
 shot again; moment quick cry went up. lashed round
 round fish’s back; pinioned turns upon turns in
 which, past night, whale reeled involutions of
 lines around him, half torn body parsee seen; his
 sable raiment frayed shreds; distended eyes turned full upon old
 ahab.
 
harpoon dropped hand.
 
“befooled, befooled!”—drawing long lean breath—“aye, parsee! see
 thee again.—aye, thou goest before; this, _this_ the
 hearse thou didst promise. hold thee last letter of
 thy word. second hearse? away, mates, ship! those
 boats useless now; repair ye can time, return me;
 not, ahab enough die—down, men! first thing but
 offers jump boat stand in, thing harpoon. ye are
 men, arms legs; obey me.—where’s the
 whale? gone again?”
 
looked nigh boat; bent upon escaping the
 corpse bore, particular place last encounter
 stage leeward voyage, moby dick now again
 steadily swimming forward; almost passed ship,—which thus
 far sailing contrary direction him, though the
 present headway stopped. seemed swimming his
 utmost velocity, now intent upon pursuing straight
 path sea.
 
“oh! ahab,” cried starbuck, “not late it, even now, third
 day, desist. see! moby dick seeks thee not. thou, thou, that
 madly seekest him!”
 
setting sail rising wind, lonely boat swiftly impelled
 leeward, oars canvas. last ahab sliding
 vessel, near plainly distinguish starbuck’s face he
 leaned rail, hailed turn vessel about, and
 follow him, swiftly, judicious interval. glancing upwards,
 saw tashtego, queequeg, daggoo, eagerly mounting three
 mast-heads; oarsmen rocking two staved boats
 just hoisted side, busily work in
 repairing them. one other, port-holes, he
 sped, also caught flying glimpses stubb flask, busying
 deck among bundles new irons lances. saw all
 this; heard hammers broken boats; far hammers
 seemed driving nail heart. rallied. now marking
 vane flag gone main-mast-head, shouted to
 tashtego, just gained perch, descend another
 flag, hammer nails, nail mast.
 
whether fagged three days’ running chase, resistance to
 swimming knotted hamper bore; whether some
 latent deceitfulness malice him: whichever true, white
 whale’s way now began abate, seemed, boat rapidly
 nearing more; though indeed whale’s last start not
 long one before. still ahab glided waves
 unpitying sharks accompanied him; pertinaciously stuck to
 boat; continually bit plying oars, blades
 became jagged crunched, left small splinters sea, at
 almost every dip.
 
“heed not! teeth give new rowlocks oars. pull
 on! ’tis better rest, shark’s jaw yielding water.”
 
“but every bite, sir, thin blades grow smaller smaller!”
 
“they will last long enough! pull on!—but can tell”—he
 muttered—“whether sharks swim feast whale on
 ahab?—but pull on! aye, alive, now—we near him. helm! take the
 helm! let pass,”—and saying two oarsmen helped forward
 bows still flying boat.
 
length craft cast one side, ran ranging along with
 white whale’s flank, seemed strangely oblivious its
 advance—as whale sometimes will—and ahab fairly within the
 smoky mountain mist, which, thrown whale’s spout, curled
 round great, monadnock hump; even thus close him; when,
 body arched back, arms lengthwise high-lifted the
 poise, darted fierce iron, far fiercer curse the
 hated whale. steel curse sank socket, sucked
 morass, moby dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his
 nigh flank bow, and, without staving hole it, so
 suddenly canted boat over, elevated
 part gunwale clung, ahab have
 tossed sea. was, three oarsmen—who foreknew
 precise instant dart, therefore unprepared for
 effects—these flung out; fell, that, instant two
 clutched gunwale again, rising level a
 combing wave, hurled bodily inboard again; third man
 helplessly dropping astern, still afloat swimming.
 
almost simultaneously, mighty volition ungraduated,
 instantaneous swiftness, white whale darted weltering
 sea. ahab cried steersman take new turns with
 line, hold so; commanded crew turn round their
 seats, tow boat mark; moment treacherous line
 felt double strain tug, snapped empty air!
 
“what breaks me? sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars! oars!
 burst upon him!”
 
hearing tremendous rush sea-crashing boat, whale wheeled
 round present blank forehead bay; evolution,
 catching sight nearing black hull ship; seemingly seeing
 source persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a
 larger nobler foe; sudden, bore upon advancing
 prow, smiting jaws amid fiery showers foam.
 
ahab staggered; hand smote forehead. “i grow blind; hands!
 stretch may yet grope way. is’t night?”
 
“the whale! ship!” cried cringing oarsmen.
 
“oars! oars! slope downwards thy depths, sea, ere for
 ever late, ahab may slide last, last time upon mark! i
 see: ship! ship! dash on, men! will ye save ship?”
 
oarsmen violently forced boat the
 sledge-hammering seas, whale-smitten bow-ends two planks
 burst through, instant almost, temporarily disabled boat
 lay nearly level waves; half-wading, splashing crew,
 trying hard stop gap bale pouring water.
 
meantime, one beholding instant, tashtego’s mast-head hammer
 remained suspended hand; red flag, half-wrapping as
 plaid, streamed straight him, own
 forward-flowing heart; starbuck stubb, standing upon the
 bowsprit beneath, caught sight down-coming monster just soon
 he.
 
“the whale, whale! helm, helm! oh, ye sweet powers of
 air, now hug close! let starbuck die, die must, a
 woman’s fainting fit. helm, say—ye fools, jaw! jaw! is
 end bursting prayers? life-long fidelities?
 oh, ahab, ahab, lo, thy work. steady! helmsman, steady. nay, nay! up
 helm again! turns meet us! oh, unappeasable brow drives on
 towards one, whose duty tells depart. god, stand me
 now!”
 
“stand me, stand me, whoever will now
 help stubb; stubb, too, sticks here. grin thee, thou grinning
 whale! ever helped stubb, kept stubb awake, stubb’s own
 unwinking eye? now poor stubb goes bed upon mattrass is
 soft; stuffed brushwood! grin thee,
 thou grinning whale! look ye, sun, moon, stars! call ye assassins
 good fellow ever spouted ghost. that, would
 yet ring glasses ye, ye hand cup! oh, oh! oh, oh!
 thou grinning whale, there’ll plenty gulping soon! fly ye
 not, ahab! me, shoes jacket it; let stubb die his
 drawers! mouldy salted death, though;—cherries!
 cherries! cherries! oh, flask, one red cherry ere die!”
 
“cherries? wish grow. oh, stubb, hope
 poor mother’s drawn part-pay ere this; not, coppers will
 now come her, voyage up.”
 
ship’s bows, nearly seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
 bits plank, lances, harpoons, mechanically retained their
 hands, just darted various employments; all
 enchanted eyes intent upon whale, side side
 strangely vibrating predestinating head, sent broad band of
 overspreading semicircular foam rushed. retribution,
 swift vengeance, eternal malice whole aspect, spite of
 mortal man do, solid white buttress forehead
 smote ship’s starboard bow, till men timbers reeled. fell
 flat upon faces. like dislodged trucks, heads the
 harpooneers aloft shook bull-like necks. breach,
 heard waters pour, mountain torrents flume.
 
“the ship! hearse!—the second hearse!” cried ahab boat;
 “its wood american!”
 
diving beneath settling ship, whale ran quivering along its
 keel; turning water, swiftly shot surface again, far
 bow, within yards ahab’s boat, where, a
 time, lay quiescent.
 
“i turn body sun. ho, tashtego! let hear thy
 hammer. oh! ye three unsurrendered spires mine; thou uncracked keel;
 god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, haughty helm, and
 pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious ship! must ye perish, and
 without me? cut last fond pride meanest
 shipwrecked captains? oh, lonely death lonely life! oh, now feel
 topmost greatness lies topmost grief. ho, ho! your
 furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows whole foregone
 life, top one piled comber death! towards thee roll,
 thou all-destroying unconquering whale; last grapple with
 thee; hell’s heart stab thee; hate’s sake spit last
 breath thee. sink coffins hearses one common pool!
 since neither can mine, let tow pieces, still
 chasing thee, though tied thee, thou damned whale! _thus_, give up
 spear!”
 
harpoon darted; stricken whale flew forward; igniting
 velocity line ran grooves;—ran foul. ahab stooped to
 clear it; clear it; flying turn caught round the
 neck, voicelessly turkish mutes bowstring victim, was
 shot boat, ere crew knew gone. next instant, the
 heavy eye-splice rope’s final end flew stark-empty
 tub, knocked oarsman, smiting sea, disappeared its
 depths.
 
instant, tranced boat’s crew stood still; turned. “the
 ship? great god, ship?” soon dim, bewildering
 mediums saw sidelong fading phantom, gaseous fata
 morgana; uppermost masts water; fixed by
 infatuation, fidelity, fate, lofty perches, the
 pagan harpooneers still maintained sinking lookouts sea.
 now, concentric circles seized lone boat itself, its
 crew, floating oar, every lance-pole, spinning,
 animate inanimate, round round one vortex, carried the
 smallest chip pequod sight.
 
last whelmings intermixingly poured the
 sunken head indian mainmast, leaving inches the
 erect spar yet visible, together long streaming yards flag,
 calmly undulated, ironical coincidings, destroying
 billows almost touched;—at instant, red arm hammer
 hovered backwardly uplifted open air, act nailing the
 flag faster yet faster subsiding spar. sky-hawk that
 tauntingly followed main-truck downwards natural home
 among stars, pecking flag, incommoding tashtego there;
 bird now chanced intercept broad fluttering wing between
 hammer wood; simultaneously feeling etherial
 thrill, submerged savage beneath, death-gasp, kept his
 hammer frozen there; bird heaven, archangelic
 shrieks, imperial beak thrust upwards, whole captive
 form folded flag ahab, went ship, which, like
 satan, sink hell till dragged living part of
 heaven along her, helmeted it.
 
now small fowls flew screaming yet yawning gulf; sullen
 white surf beat steep sides; collapsed, the
 great shroud rolled rolled five thousand years ago.
