preface first edition
 

translation intended supplement work entitled “the
 authoress odyssey”, published 1897. give
 whole “odyssey” book without making unwieldy, i
 therefore epitomised translation, already completed and
 now publish full.
 
shall argue two main points dealt work just
 mentioned; nothing either add to, withdraw from, i
 written. points question are:
 
(1) “odyssey” written entirely at, drawn entirely
 from, place now called trapani west coast sicily, alike
 regards phaeacian ithaca scenes; voyages of
 ulysses, within easy reach sicily, solve themselves
 periplus island, practically trapani back to
 trapani, via lipari islands, straits messina, island
 pantellaria.
 
(2) poem entirely written young woman, lived
 place now called trapani, introduced work
 name nausicaa.
 
main arguments base first somewhat
 startling contentions, prominently repeatedly the
 english italian public ever since appeared (without rejoinder)
 “athenaeum” january 30 february 20, 1892. both
 contentions urged (also without rejoinder) johnian “eagle”
 lent october terms year. nothing i
 reply reached quarter, knowing anxiously
 endeavoured learn existence flaws argument,
 begin feel confidence that, flaws exist, should
 heard, rate them, now. without,
 therefore, moment pretending think scholars generally
 acquiesce conclusions, shall act thinking little likely
 gainsay will incumbent upon reply, and
 shall confine translating “odyssey” english readers,
 notes think will found useful. among would
 especially call attention one xxii. 465-473 lord grimthorpe
 kindly allowed make public.
 
repeated several illustrations used “the authoress of
 odyssey”, added two hope may bring outer court
 ulysses’ house vividly reader. like to
 explain presence man dog one illustration is
 accidental, observed till developed negative.
 appendix also reprinted paragraphs explanatory the
 plan ulysses’ house, together plan itself. reader is
 recommended study plan attention.
 
preface translation “iliad” given views
 main principles translator guided, and
 need repeat here, beyond pointing initial liberty
 translating poetry prose involves continual taking more
 less liberty throughout translation; much right in
 poetry wrong prose, exigencies readable prose the
 first things considered prose translation. reader,
 however, may see far departed strict construe, will
 print messrs. butcher lang’s translation sixty lines or
 “odyssey.” translation runs:
 
tell me, muse, man, ready need, wandered far and
 wide, sacked sacred citadel troy, many the
 men whose towns saw whose mind learnt, yea, many woes
 suffered heart deep, striving win life and
 return company. nay, even saved company,
 though desired sore. blindness own
 hearts perished, fools, devoured oxen helios hyperion:
 god took day returning. things,
 goddess, daughter zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,
 declare thou even unto us.
 
now rest, many fled sheer destruction, at
 home, escaped war sea, odysseus only, craving
 wife homeward path, lady nymph calypso
 held, fair goddess, hollow caves, longing him
 lord. now year come courses the
 seasons, wherein gods ordained return home
 ithaca, even quit labours, even among
 own; gods pity save poseidon, raged
 continually godlike odysseus, till came own
 country. howbeit poseidon now departed distant
 ethiopians, ethiopians sundered twain, the
 uttermost men, abiding hyperion sinks where
 rises. looked receive hecatomb bulls and
 rams, made merry sitting feast, gods
 gathered halls olympian zeus. among the
 father men gods began speak, bethought his
 heart noble aegisthus, agamemnon, far-famed
 orestes, slew. thinking upon spake among immortals:
 ‘lo now, vainly mortal men blame gods! us
 say comes evil, whereas even themselves, the
 blindness hearts, sorrows beyond is
 ordained. even late aegisthus, beyond was
 ordained, took wedded wife atreus, and
 killed lord return, sheer doom his
 eyes, since warned embassy hermes the
 keen-sighted, slayer argos, neither kill the
 man, woo wife. atreus shall avenged at
 hand orestes, soon shall come man’s estate and
 long country. spake hermes, yet prevailed on
 heart aegisthus, good will; now hath paid
 one price all.’
 
goddess, grey-eyed athene, answered him, saying: ‘o father,
 father cronides, throned highest; man assuredly
 lies death due; perish likewise work
 deeds! heart rent wise odysseus, hapless
 one, far friends long suffereth affliction
 sea-girt isle, navel sea, woodland isle,
 therein goddess hath habitation, daughter the
 wizard atlas, knows depths every sea, himself
 upholds tall pillars keep earth sky asunder. his
 daughter holds hapless man sorrow: ever with
 soft guileful tales wooing forgetfulness of
 ithaca. odysseus yearning see smoke leap
 upwards land, hath desire die. thee, thine
 heart regardeth all, olympian! what! odysseus by
 ships argives make thee free offering sacrifice in
 wide trojan land? wherefore wast thou wroth him, o
 zeus?’
 

“odyssey” (as every one knows) abounds passages borrowed from
 “iliad”; wished print slightly different type,
 marginal references “iliad,” marked this
 end ms. found, however, translation thus
 hopelessly scholasticised, abandoned intention. would
 nevertheless urge management university
 presses, render great service students they
 publish greek text “odyssey” iliadic passages
 printed different type, marginal references. given
 british museum copy “odyssey” iliadic passages
 underlined referred ms.; also given “iliad” marked
 odyssean passages, references; copies of
 “iliad” “odyssey” marked within easy reach
 students.
 
one present day discusses questions arisen
 round “iliad” since wolf’s time, without keeping well his
 reader’s mind “odyssey” demonstrably written one
 single neighbourhood, hence (even though nothing else pointed to
 conclusion) presumably one person only—that written
 certainly 750, probability 1000 b.c.—that the
 writer early poem demonstrably familiar the
 “iliad” now it, borrowing freely books whose
 genuineness impugned, admitted to
 homer—any one fails keep points readers,
 hardly dealing equitably them. one hand, who
 will mark “iliad” “odyssey” copies british
 museum referred to, will draw inference that
 common sense can draw presence many identical passages
 poems, will, believe, find difficulty assigning their
 proper value large number books continent that
 present enjoy considerable reputations. furthermore, this
 perhaps advantage better worth securing, will find many
 puzzles “odyssey” cease puzzle discovery they
 arise over-saturation “iliad.”
 
difficulties will also disappear soon development of
 poem writer’s mind understood. dealt at
 length pp. 251-261 “the authoress odyssey”. briefly,
 “odyssey” consists two distinct poems: (1) return of
 ulysses, alone muse asked sing opening lines of
 poem. poem includes phaeacian episode, account of
 ulysses’ adventures told books ix.-xii. consists of
 lines 1-79 (roughly) book i., line 28 book v., thence
 without intermission middle line 187 book xiii., which
 point original scheme abandoned.
 
(2) story penelope suitors, episode of
 telemachus’ voyage pylos. poem begins line 80 (roughly) of
 book i., continued end book iv., resumed till
 ulysses wakes middle line 187, book xiii., whence it
 continues end book xxiv.
 
“the authoress odyssey”, wrote:
 
introduction lines xi., 115-137 line ix., 535, the
 writing new council gods beginning book v., take
 place one removed book i., 1-79, only
 things done give even semblance unity old
 scheme new, conceal fact muse, being
 asked sing one subject, spend two-thirds time singing a
 different one, climax no-one asked her. for
 roughly return occupies eight books, penelope suitors
 sixteen.
 

believe substantially correct.
 
lastly, deal unimportant point, observe the
 leipsic teubner edition 894 makes books ii. iii. end a
 comma. stops things far recent date the

gods council—minerva’s visit ithaca—the challenge from
 telemachus suitors.
 

tell me, muse, ingenious hero travelled far wide
 sacked famous town troy. many cities visit,
 many nations whose manners customs was
 acquainted; moreover suffered much trying save his
 life bring men safely home; might could
 save men, perished sheer folly in
 eating cattle sun-god hyperion; god prevented them
 ever reaching home. tell me, too, things, oh
 daughter jove, whatsoever source may know them.
 
now escaped death battle shipwreck got safely
 home except ulysses, he, though longing return his
 wife country, detained goddess calypso, got him
 large cave wanted marry him. years went by, there
 came time gods settled go back ithaca;
 even then, however, among people, troubles were
 yet over; nevertheless gods now begun pity him
 except neptune, still persecuted without ceasing not
 let get home.
 
now neptune gone ethiopians, world’s end,
 lie two halves, one looking west east.1 had
 gone accept hecatomb sheep oxen, enjoying
 festival; gods met house of
 olympian jove, sire gods men spoke first. moment
 thinking aegisthus, killed agamemnon’s son
 orestes; said gods:
 
“see now, men lay blame upon us gods nothing
 folly. look aegisthus; must needs make love to
 agamemnon’s wife unrighteously kill agamemnon, though knew
 death him; sent mercury warn do
 either things, inasmuch orestes sure take his
 revenge grew wanted return home. mercury told him
 good will listen, now paid for
 everything full.”
 
minerva said, “father, saturn, king kings, served
 aegisthus right, one else did; but
 aegisthus neither there; ulysses heart
 bleeds, think sufferings lonely sea-girt island,
 far away, poor man, friends. island covered with
 forest, middle sea, goddess lives there,
 daughter magician atlas, looks bottom the
 ocean, carries great columns keep heaven earth
 asunder. daughter atlas got hold poor unhappy ulysses,
 keeps trying every kind blandishment make forget his
 home, tired life, thinks nothing may
 see smoke chimneys. you, sir, take heed of
 this, yet ulysses troy propitiate you
 many burnt sacrifice? keep angry
 him?”
 
jove said, “my child, talking about? can forget
 ulysses capable man earth, more
 liberal offerings immortal gods live heaven? bear
 mind, however, neptune still furious ulysses having
 blinded eye polyphemus king cyclopes. polyphemus to
 neptune nymph thoosa, daughter sea-king phorcys;
 therefore though will kill ulysses outright, torments by
 preventing getting home. still, let us lay heads together
 see can help return; neptune will pacified,
 mind can hardly stand us.”
 
minerva said, “father, saturn, king kings, if, then, the
 gods now mean ulysses get home, first send
 mercury ogygian island tell calypso made our
 minds return. meantime will go ithaca, to
 put heart ulysses’ telemachus; will embolden call the
 achaeans assembly, speak suitors mother
 penelope, persist eating number sheep oxen; i
 will also conduct sparta pylos, see can hear
 anything return dear father—for will make people
 speak well him.”
 
saying bound glittering golden sandals, imperishable,
 can fly like wind land sea; grasped the
 redoubtable bronze-shod spear, stout sturdy strong,
 wherewith quells ranks heroes displeased her, and
 darted topmost summits olympus, whereon forthwith
 ithaca, gateway ulysses’ house, disguised a
 visitor, mentes, chief taphians, held bronze spear in
 hand. found lordly suitors seated hides the
 oxen killed eaten, playing draughts front of
 house. men-servants pages bustling wait upon
 them, mixing wine water mixing-bowls, cleaning
 tables wet sponges laying again, some
 cutting great quantities meat.
 
telemachus saw long one else did. sitting moodily
 among suitors thinking brave father, would
 send flying house, come again
 honoured days gone by. thus brooding sat among them,
 caught sight minerva went straight gate, was
 vexed stranger kept waiting admittance. took
 right hand own, bade give spear. “welcome,”
 said he, “to house, partaken food shall
 tell us come for.”

 poured silver basin wash hands, she
 drew clean table beside them. upper servant brought bread,
 offered many good things house, the
 carver fetched plates manner meats set cups gold
 side, manservant brought wine poured for
 them.
 

suitors came took places benches and
 seats.3 forthwith men servants poured water hands, maids
 went round bread-baskets, pages filled mixing-bowls with
 wine water, laid hands upon good things that

 wanted music dancing, crowning embellishments a
 banquet, servant brought lyre phemius, compelled
 perforce sing them. soon touched lyre began to
 sing telemachus spoke low minerva, head close that
 man might hear.
 
“i hope, sir,” said he, “that will offended am
 going say. singing comes cheap pay it, and
 done cost one whose bones lie rotting some
 wilderness grinding powder surf. men see
 father come back ithaca pray longer legs rather

 sir, tell tell true, come from.

“my mother,” answered telemachus, “tells ulysses, it
 wise child knows father. one
 grown old upon estates, for, since ask me, is
 ill-starred man heaven tell my
 father.”
 
minerva said, “there fear race dying yet, while

 guests—how atrociously behaving; riot make

“sir,” said telemachus, “as regards question, long father

 yet bring matters end; making havoc estate, and
 long will also myself.”
 
“is so?” exclaimed minerva, “then indeed want ulysses home

“but there! rests heaven determine whether return,

 advice, call achaean heroes assembly to-morrow morning—lay your

 thence go sparta visit menelaus, got home last all
 achaeans; hear father alive way
 home, can put waste suitors will make yet
 another twelve months. hand hear death, come
 home once, celebrate funeral rites due pomp, build a
 barrow memory, make mother marry again. then, having
 done this, think well mind how, fair means or
 foul, may kill suitors house. old to
 plead infancy longer; heard people singing
 orestes’ praises killed father’s murderer aegisthus? you
 fine, smart looking fellow; show mettle, then, make
 name story. now, however, must go back ship and
 crew, will impatient keep waiting longer; think
 matter yourself, remember said you.”
 
“sir,” answered telemachus, “it kind talk me
 way, though son, will tell
 me; know want getting voyage, stay a
 little longer till taken bath refreshed yourself. will
 give present, shall go way rejoicing; will
 give one great beauty value—a keepsake dear
 friends give one another.”
 
minerva answered, “do try keep me, way at
 once. present may disposed make me, keep till i
 come again, will take home me. shall give very
 good one, will give one less value return.”
 
words flew away like bird air, had
 given telemachus courage, made think ever about
 father. felt change, wondered it, knew the
 stranger god, went straight suitors were
 sitting.
 
phemius still singing, hearers sat rapt silence he
 told sad tale return troy, ills minerva had
 laid upon achaeans. penelope, daughter icarius, heard song
 room upstairs, came great staircase, not
 alone, attended two handmaids. reached the
 suitors stood one bearing posts supported roof
 cloisters8 staid maiden either side her. held a
 veil, moreover, face, weeping bitterly.
 
“phemius,” cried, “you know many another feat gods heroes,
 poets love celebrate. sing suitors one these,
 let drink wine silence, cease sad tale, for
 breaks sorrowful heart, reminds lost husband i
 mourn ever without ceasing, whose name great hellas
 middle argos.”9
 
“mother,” answered telemachus, “let bard sing mind
 to; bards make ills sing of; jove, they, who
 makes them, sends weal woe upon mankind according own
 good pleasure. fellow means harm singing ill-fated
 return danaans, people always applaud latest songs most
 warmly. make mind bear it; ulysses only
 man never came back troy, many another went well
 he. go, then, within house busy daily
 duties, loom, distaff, ordering servants; for
 speech man’s matter, mine others 10—for am
 master here.”
 
went wondering back house, laid son’s saying in
 heart. then, going upstairs handmaids room, she
 mourned dear husband till minerva shed sweet sleep eyes.
 suitors clamorous throughout covered cloisters11, and
 prayed one might bed fellow.
 
telemachus spoke, “shameless,” cried, “and insolent suitors,
 let us feast pleasure now, let brawling, it
 rare thing hear man divine voice phemius has;
 morning meet full assembly may give formal
 notice depart, feast one another’s houses, turn turn
 about, cost. hand choose persist in
 spunging upon one man, heaven help me, jove shall reckon you
 full, fall father’s house shall man
 avenge you.”
 
suitors bit lips heard him, marvelled the
 boldness speech. then, antinous, eupeithes, said, “the
 gods seem given lessons bluster tall talking; may
 jove never grant chief ithaca father before
 you.”
 
telemachus answered, “antinous, chide me, but, god willing,
 will chief can. worst fate can think of
 me? bad thing chief, brings riches and
 honour. still, now ulysses dead many great men in
 ithaca old young, may take lead among them;
 nevertheless will chief house, will rule whom
 ulysses won me.”
 
eurymachus, polybus, answered, “it rests heaven to
 decide shall chief among us, shall master own
 house possessions; one man in
 ithaca shall violence rob you. now, good fellow, i
 want know stranger. country come from? of
 family he, estate? brought news

“my father dead gone,” answered telemachus, “and even some
 rumour reaches put faith now. mother indeed
 sometimes send soothsayer question him, give his
 prophecyings heed. stranger, mentes, of
 anchialus, chief taphians, old friend father’s.” in
 heart knew goddess.
 
suitors returned singing dancing the
 evening; night fell upon pleasuring went home to
 bed abode.12 telemachus’s room high tower13
 looked outer court; hither, then, hied, brooding and
 full thought. good old woman, euryclea, daughter ops, son
 pisenor, went couple blazing torches. laertes
 bought money quite young; gave the
 worth twenty oxen her, shewed much respect his
 household wedded wife, take to

 lighted telemachus room, loved better of

 baby. opened door bed room sat upon bed; as

 minerva disguised mentor.
 

now child morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared telemachus
 rose dressed himself. bound sandals comely feet,
 girded sword shoulder, left room looking like an
 immortal god. sent criers round call people in
 assembly, called people gathered thereon; then,
 got together, went place assembly spear in
 hand—not alone, two hounds went him. minerva endowed him

 went by, took place father’s seat even the

“men ithaca,” said, “hear words. day ulysses left us

 excellent person, hope jove will grant heart’s

telemachus took speech good omen rose once, he
 bursting say. stood middle the

 turning aegyptius, “sir,” said he, “it i, will shortly
 learn, convened you, aggrieved. i

 day day keep hanging father’s house, sacrificing our

 eating yourselves, take action some
 purpose, serve notices house house till got paid
 full, whereas now remedy.”19
 
telemachus dashed staff ground burst into
 tears. every one sorry him, sat still no
 one ventured make angry answer, save antinous, spoke
 thus:
 
“telemachus, insolent braggart are, dare try throw
 blame upon us suitors? mother’s fault ours, she
 artful woman. three years past, close four, she
 driving us minds, encouraging one us,
 sending messages without meaning one word says. and

“this said, assented; whereon see her

 endowed her, long shall go eating estate; not
 see change, gets honour glory, and

telemachus answered, “antinous, can drive mother bore me

 large sum must give insist sending daughter

 also punish me; mother leaves house will call on

 might be; whereon halitherses, best prophet and
 reader omens among them, spoke plainly honesty,
 saying:
 
“hear me, men ithaca, speak particularly suitors,

“but how, mentor,” replied telemachus, “dare go nestor, how

“some things, telemachus,” answered minerva, “will suggested you

 side, full fine spun yarn, distaff charged violet
 coloured wool laid upon top it. helen took seat,
 put feet upon footstool, began question husband.42
 
“do know, menelaus,” said she, “the names strangers who

thus speak, words set weeping. helen wept,
 telemachus wept, menelaus, pisistratus keep his

 bright dawn killed. thereon said menelaus,
 
“sir, father nestor, used talk home, told me

 atreus lay inner room lovely helen side.
 
child morning, rosy-fingered dawn appeared, menelaus rose
 dressed himself. bound sandals comely feet, girded
 sword shoulders, left room looking like an
 immortal god. then, taking seat near telemachus said:
 
“and what, telemachus, led take long voyage to

“i come, sir,” replied telemachus, “to see can tell me

meanwhile suitors throwing discs aiming spears a

 behaving old insolence. antinous eurymachus, who
 ringleaders much foremost among all, were
 sitting together noemon phronius came said to
 antinous,
 
“have idea, antinous, day telemachus returns pylos?

astounded heard this, made sure that
 telemachus gone city neleus. thought only

“i lent him,” answered noemon, “what else man of

noemon went back father’s house, antinous and
 eurymachus angry. told others leave playing,

 antinous eupeithes spoke anger. heart black with
 rage, eyes flashed fire said:
 
“good heavens, voyage telemachus serious matter; we

thus speak, others applauded saying; all
 went inside buildings.
 
long ere penelope came know suitors were
 plotting; man servant, medon, overheard outside the
 outer court laying schemes within, went tell
 mistress. crossed threshold room penelope said:
 “medon, suitors sent for? tell the
 maids leave master’s business cook dinner them? wish
 may neither woo dine henceforward, neither anywhere
 else, let last time, waste make of

 good ulysses them—never anything high-handed, nor
 speaking harshly anybody? kings may say things sometimes, they
 may take fancy one man dislike another, ulysses never did
 unjust thing anybody—which shows bad hearts have, and
 thing gratitude left world.”
 
medon said, “i wish, madam, all; are
 plotting something much dreadful now—may heaven frustrate their
 design. going try murder telemachus coming

penelope’s heart sank within her, long time was
 speechless; eyes filled tears, find no
 utterance. last, however, said, “why leave me? what

 ocean like sea-horses? want die without leaving one

“i know,” answered medon, “whether god set it, or

went downstairs again, leaving penelope agony grief.

 went upstairs maids. put bruised barley a

“hear me,” cried, “daughter aegis-bearing jove, unweariable. if

 ship fast little way out, came shore again, got suppers, and
 waited till night fall.
 
penelope lay room upstairs unable eat drink, and
 wondering whether brave escape, overpowered the
 wicked suitors. like lioness caught toils huntsmen
 hemming every side thought thought till sank into

minerva bethought another matter, made vision the

“then,” said penelope, “if god sent by

vision said, “i shall tell certain whether is

vanished thong-hole door dissipated

 comforted, vivid dream.

calypso—ulysses reaches scheria raft.
 

now, dawn rose couch beside tithonus—harbinger light
 alike mortals immortals—the gods met council them,
 jove lord thunder, king. thereon minerva began to
 tell many sufferings ulysses, pitied away
 house nymph calypso.
 
“father jove,” said she, “and gods live in

 well-disposed ruler more, one will govern equitably. hope

“what, dear, talking about?” replied father, “did you
 send yourself, thought help ulysses
 get home punish suitors? besides, perfectly able to
 protect telemachus, see safely home again, suitors
 come hurry-skurrying back without killed him.”
 
thus spoken, said mercury, “mercury, are

 pretty close together, turned hither thither irrigate

 even god help charmed lovely spot, so
 mercury stood still looked it; admired it

calypso knew once—for gods know other, matter

 sea-shore usual, looking upon barren ocean tears

 mercury seat said: “why come see me,
 mercury—honoured, ever welcome—for visit often? say

“then send away,” said mercury, “or jove will angry and

took leave, calypso went look ulysses,
 heard jove’s message. found sitting upon beach
 eyes ever filled tears, dying sheer home sickness;
 got tired calypso, though forced sleep with
 cave night, she, he, so. as
 day time, spent rocks shore,
 weeping, crying aloud despair, always looking upon the
 sea. calypso went close said:
 
“my poor fellow, shall stay grieving fretting your

 go, cut beams wood, make large raft an
 upper deck may carry safely sea. will put bread,
 wine, water board save starving. will also give
 clothes, will send fair wind take home, the
 gods heaven will it—for know things, and
 can settle better can.”
 
ulysses shuddered heard her. “now goddess,” answered, “there
 something behind this; really meaning help me

 even well found ship fair wind venture a
 distant voyage: nothing can say shall make go on

calypso smiled caressed hand: “you know a

thus spoken led way rapidly him, and
 ulysses followed steps; pair, goddess man, went on
 till came calypso’s cave, ulysses took seat
 mercury just left. calypso set meat drink of
 food mortals eat; maids brought ambrosia nectar
 herself, laid hands good things were
 them. satisfied meat drink,
 calypso spoke, saying:
 
“ulysses, noble laertes, start home own
 land once? good luck go you, know how
 much suffering store get back own

 let make immortal, matter anxious may see this
 wife yours, thinking time day day; yet
 flatter whit less tall well-looking she

“goddess,” replied ulysses, “do angry this. am
 quite aware wife penelope nothing like tall so
 beautiful yourself. woman, whereas an

 found much good meat. moreover, made wind fair warm

king neptune, returning ethiopians, caught sight
 ulysses long way off, mountains solymi. could
 see sailing upon sea, made angry, wagged
 head muttered himself, saying, “good heavens, gods
 changing minds ulysses away in
 ethiopia, now close land phaeacians, it
 decreed shall escape calamities befallen
 him. still, shall plenty hardship yet done
 it.”
 
thereon gathered clouds together, grasped trident, stirred
 round sea, roused rage every wind blows till
 earth, sea, sky hidden cloud, night sprang forth of
 heavens. winds east, south, north, west fell upon all
 time, tremendous got up, ulysses’ heart
 began fail him. “alas,” said dismay, “what ever

plight, ino daughter cadmus, also called
 leucothea, saw him. formerly mere mortal, been
 since raised rank marine goddess. seeing great
 distress ulysses now was, compassion upon him, and, rising like
 sea-gull waves, took seat upon raft.
 
“my poor good man,” said she, “why neptune furiously angry with
 you? giving great deal trouble, bluster
 will kill you. seem sensible person, i
 bid you; strip, leave raft drive wind, swim to
 phaeacian coast better luck awaits you. here, take my
 veil put round chest; enchanted, can come to
 harm long wear it. soon touch land take off,
 throw back far can sea, go away again.”
 words took veil gave him. dived
 like sea-gull vanished beneath dark blue waters.
 
ulysses know think. “alas,” said in
 dismay, “this one gods luring
 ruin advising quit raft. rate will so
 present, land said quit all
 troubles seemed still good way off. know will do—i am
 sure will best—no matter happens will stick raft as
 long timbers hold together, breaks i
 will swim it; see can better this.”
 
thus two minds, neptune sent terrible great wave that
 seemed rear head till broke right raft,
 went pieces though heap dry chaff tossed
 whirlwind. ulysses got astride one plank rode upon it
 horseback; took clothes calypso had
 given him, bound ino’s veil arms, plunged the
 sea—meaning swim shore. king neptune watched so,
 wagged head, muttering saying, “there now, swim
 best can till fall well-to-do people. i
 think will able say let too
 lightly.” lashed horses drove aegae his
 palace is.
 
minerva resolved help ulysses, bound ways the
 winds except one, made lie quite still; roused good
 stiff breeze north lay waters till ulysses
 reached land phaeacians safe.
 
thereon floated two nights two days water, with
 heavy swell death staring face; when
 third day broke, wind fell dead calm without so
 much breath air stirring. rose swell looked
 eagerly ahead, see land quite near. then, children rejoice
 dear father begins get better long
 time borne sore affliction sent angry spirit, gods

 set foot upon dry ground. when, however, got within earshot, he
 began hear surf thundering rocks, swell
 still broke terrific roar. everything enveloped
 spray; harbours ship might ride, shelter
 kind, headlands, low-lying rocks, mountain tops.
 
ulysses’ heart now began fail him, said despairingly to
 himself, “alas, jove let see land swimming far i

thus two minds wave caught took such

 rock hands clung groaning pain till wave
 retired, saved time; presently wave came on

poor ulysses certainly perished even spite his

“hear me, king, whoever may be, save anger the

god staid stream stilled waves, making calm
 him, bringing safely mouth river. here
 last ulysses’ knees strong hands failed him, had
 completely broken him. body swollen, mouth and
 nostrils ran like river sea-water, neither
 breathe speak, lay swooning sheer exhaustion; presently,
 got breath came again, took the
 scarf ino given threw back salt54 stream

 bore towards her. left river, laid among
 rushes, kissed bounteous earth.
 
“alas,” cried dismay, “what ever will become of

 heaped leaves round him. then, one lives alone in

 ulysses cover leaves; minerva shed sweet sleep

“alas,” said himself, “what kind people come amongst?

 ulysses seem young women, drew near naked as

 begrimed salt water, others scampered along spits that

 minerva put courage heart took away fear her. she
 stood right front ulysses, doubted whether go up

 honeyed persuasive language.
 
“o queen,” said, “i implore aid—but tell me, goddess

“and now, queen, pity upon me, first person i

maids left running away began calling one another

thus, then, ulysses wait pray; girl drove the

 brought supper room.
 
presently ulysses got go towards town; minerva shed a
 thick mist round hide case proud
 phaeacians met rude him, ask was.
 then, just entering town, came towards the
 likeness little girl carrying pitcher. stood right front
 him, ulysses said:
 
“my dear, will kind show house king alcinous?
 unfortunate foreigner distress, know one your

minerva said, “yes, father stranger, will show house you

minerva left scheria went away sea. went to

 pondered much paused reaching threshold of

ulysses stood looked him, had

 minerva enveloped him, till reached arete king alcinous;
 laid hands upon knees queen, moment
 miraculous darkness fell away became visible. every
 one speechless surprise seeing man there, ulysses
 began petition.
 
“queen arete,” exclaimed, “daughter great rhexenor, my
 distress humbly pray you, also husband guests
 (whom may heaven prosper long life happiness, may they
 leave possessions children, honours
 conferred upon state) help home country as
 soon possible; long trouble away my
 friends.”
 
sat hearth among ashes held their
 peace, till presently old hero echeneus, excellent
 speaker elder among phaeacians, plainly honesty
 addressed thus:
 
“alcinous,” said he, “it creditable stranger

 take seat stool inlaid silver, bid servants mix

alcinous heard took ulysses hand, raised from

 sitting beside him, favourite son. maid servant then
 brought water beautiful golden ewer poured a
 silver basin wash hands, drew clean table
 beside him; upper servant brought bread offered many
 good things house, ulysses ate drank.
 alcinous said one servants, “pontonous, mix cup of
 wine hand round may make drink-offerings jove the
 lord thunder, protector well-disposed suppliants.”
 
pontonous mixed wine water, handed round giving
 every man drink-offering. made offerings, and
 drunk much minded, alcinous said:
 
“aldermen town councillors phaeacians, hear words. you

 invite still larger number aldermen, will give sacrificial
 banquet honour guest; can discuss question his

ulysses said: “pray, alcinous, take notion into

 said, “aldermen town councillors phaeacians, come the

 struck appearance ulysses, minerva beautified

 remarkable man, might come well many trials

 together, alcinous spoke:
 
“hear me,” said he, “aldermen town councillors phaeacians,

alcinous led way, others followed after, a
 servant went fetch demodocus. fifty-two picked oarsmen went to

thus sang bard, ulysses drew purple mantle head

 weeping. bard left singing wiped tears from
 eyes, uncovered face, and, taking cup, made a
 drink-offering gods; phaeacians pressed demodocus

 drew mantle head wept bitterly. one noticed his
 distress except alcinous, sitting near him, heard heavy
 sighs heaving. said, “aldermen town

“you quite right, laodamas,” replied euryalus, “go guest

“for shame, sir,” answered ulysses, fiercely, “you insolent

 presently servant came back demodocus’s lyre, took his

meanwhile bard began sing loves mars venus, how

 whereon one turn towards neighbour saying:
 
“ill deeds prosper, weak confound strong. see how

thus converse, king apollo said mercury, “messenger

“king apollo,” answered mercury, “i wish might get chance,

immortal gods burst laughing heard him, neptune

thus sang bard, ulysses seafaring phaeacians were

alcinous told laodamas halius dance alone, no

 throwing ball straight air began dance, at
 time kept throwing backwards forwards one

“king alcinous, said people nimblest dancers the

king delighted this, exclaimed phaeacians,
 “aldermen town councillors, guest seems person of
 singular judgement; let us give proof hospitality he

thus speak. others applauded saying, and
 sent servants fetch presents. euryalus said, “king

ulysses answered, “good luck friend, may the

words girded sword shoulders towards
 sundown presents began make appearance, servants of
 donors kept bringing house king alcinous; his
 sons received them, placed mother’s charge. then
 alcinous led way house bade guests take seats.
 
“wife,” said he, turning queen arete, “go, fetch best chest we

ulysses said, “nausicaa, daughter great alcinous, may jove the

said this, seated beside alcinous. supper was

servant carried pork fingers demodocus, took

“eumaeus, hear footsteps; suppose one men one of

“so it, old friend,” answered telemachus, “but come now because

“she still house,” replied eumaeus, “grieving breaking

 he, “i can easily find another seat, one will lay

ulysses went back place, eumaeus strewed green

“those named,” answered telemachus, “are couple good

“these two,” continued ulysses, “will keep long fray,

 servant stood said queen presence waiting

 outbuildings went back pigs again.
 
suitors surprised angry happened, went
 outside great wall ran round outer court, held a
 council near main entrance. eurymachus, polybus, the
 first speak.
 
“my friends,” said he, “this voyage telemachus’s serious
 matter; made sure come nothing. now, however,
 let us draw ship water, get crew together send
 others tell come back fast can.”
 
hardly done speaking amphinomus turned place saw
 ship inside harbour, crew lowering sails, and
 putting oars; laughed, said others, “we need
 send message, here. god must told
 them, else saw ship go by, overtake her.”
 
rose went water side. crew drew the
 ship shore; servants took armour them, they
 went body place assembly, let any
 one old young sit along them, antinous, eupeithes,
 spoke first.
 
“good heavens,” said he, “see gods saved man from
 destruction. kept succession scouts upon headlands day

 waited ship night till morning hope capturing and
 killing him; god conveyed home spite us. let us

held peace amphinomus rose speak. the

 honestly, “i favour killing telemachus. heinous
 thing kill one noble blood. let us first take counsel of
 gods, oracles jove advise it, will help to
 kill myself, will urge everyone else so; they
 dissuade us, hold hands.”
 
thus speak, words pleased well, rose
 forthwith went house ulysses, took their
 accustomed seats.
 
penelope resolved show suitors. she
 knew plot telemachus, servant medon had
 overheard counsels told her; went therefore to
 court attended maidens, reached suitors she
 stood one bearing-posts supporting roof cloister
 holding veil face, rebuked antinous saying:
 
“antinous, insolent wicked schemer, say best
 speaker counsellor man age ithaca, are
 nothing kind. madman, try compass death of
 telemachus, take heed suppliants, whose witness jove
 himself? right plot thus one another. do
 remember father fled house fear the
 people, enraged gone taphian
 pirates plundered thesprotians peace us? they
 wanted tear pieces eat everything had, ulysses
 stayed hands although infuriated, now devour
 property without paying it, break heart wooing his
 wife trying kill son. leave so, stop the
 others also.”
 
eurymachus polybus answered, “take heart, queen penelope
 daughter icarius, trouble matters.
 man yet born, never will be, shall lay hands upon
 telemachus, yet live look upon face the
 earth. say—and shall surely be—that spear shall reddened
 blood; many time ulysses taken knees, held
 wine lips drink, put pieces meat hands.
 therefore telemachus much dearest friend have, nothing
 fear hands us suitors. course, death comes him
 gods, escape it.” said quiet her, in
 reality plotting telemachus.
 
penelope went upstairs mourned husband till minerva
 shed sleep eyes. evening eumaeus got back ulysses
 son, just sacrificed young pig year old were
 helping one another get supper ready; minerva therefore came to
 ulysses, turned old man stroke wand, clad
 old clothes again, fear swineherd might
 recognise keep secret, go tell penelope.
 
telemachus first speak. “so got back, eumaeus,”
 said he. “what news town? suitors returned, or
 still waiting yonder, take way home?”
 
“i think asking that,” replied eumaeus, “when in

telemachus mother meet—ulysses eumaeus come the
 town, ulysses insulted melanthius—he recognised dog
 argos—he insulted presently struck antinous a
 stool—penelope desires shall sent her.
 

child morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, telemachus
 bound sandals took strong spear suited hands, for
 wanted go city. “old friend,” said swineherd,
 “i will now go town show mother, will
 never leave grieving till seen me. unfortunate
 stranger, take town let beg one who
 will give drink piece bread. trouble enough my
 own, burdened people. makes angry
 much worse him, like say mean.”
 
ulysses said, “sir, want stay here; beggar can

 something. old care remaining beck
 call master. therefore let man just told
 him, take town soon warm fire,
 day got little heat it. clothes wretchedly
 thin, frosty morning shall perished cold, you
 say city way off.”
 
telemachus strode yards, brooding revenge
 upon suitors. reached home stood spear a
 bearing-post cloister, crossed stone floor cloister
 itself, went inside.
 
nurse euryclea saw long one else did. putting
 fleeces seats, burst crying ran to
 him; maids came too, covered head and
 shoulders kisses. penelope came room looking like
 diana venus, wept flung arms son. she
 kissed forehead beautiful eyes, “light eyes,”
 cried spoke fondly him, “so come home again; i
 made sure never going see more. think your
 gone pylos without saying anything obtaining
 consent. come, tell saw.”
 
“do scold me, mother,” answered telemachus, “nor vex me, seeing
 narrow escape had, wash face, change dress,
 go upstairs maids, promise full sufficient hecatombs
 gods jove will grant us revenge upon the
 suitors. must now go place assembly invite stranger
 come back pylos. sent crew, and
 told piraeus take home look till come for
 myself.”
 
heeded son’s words, washed face, changed dress, and
 vowed full sufficient hecatombs gods only
 vouchsafe revenge upon suitors.
 
telemachus went through, of, cloisters spear hand—not
 alone, two fleet dogs went him. minerva endowed a
 presence divine comeliness marvelled went
 by, suitors gathered round fair words mouths
 malice hearts; avoided them, went sit with
 mentor, antiphus, halitherses, old friends father’s house,
 made tell happened him. piraeus
 came theoclymenus, escorted town the
 place assembly, whereon telemachus joined them. piraeus was
 first speak: “telemachus,” said he, “i wish send of
 women house take away presents menelaus gave you.”
 
“we know, piraeus,” answered telemachus, “what may happen. if
 suitors kill house divide property among them,
 rather presents people
 get hold them. hand managed kill them, i
 shall much obliged will kindly bring presents.”
 
words took theoclymenus house. got
 laid cloaks benches seats, went the
 baths, washed themselves. maids washed anointed
 them, given cloaks shirts, took seats at
 table. maid servant brought water beautiful golden
 ewer, poured silver basin wash hands;
 drew clean table beside them. upper servant brought them
 bread offered many good things house.
 opposite sat penelope, reclining couch one the
 bearing-posts cloister, spinning. laid hands
 good things them, soon had
 enough eat drink penelope said:
 
“telemachus, shall go upstairs lie sad couch, which
 ceased water tears, day ulysses set out
 troy sons atreus. failed, however, make clear
 suitors came back house, whether had
 able hear anything return father.”
 
“i will tell truth,” replied son. “we went pylos and
 saw nestor, took house treated hospitably as
 though just returned long
 absence; also sons; said heard word from
 human ulysses, whether alive dead. sent
 me, therefore, chariot horses menelaus. saw
 helen, whose sake many, argives trojans, in
 heaven’s wisdom doomed suffer. menelaus asked that

 said, ‘so, then, cowards usurp brave man’s bed? hind

 comes back lair, will make short work pair them, and
 will ulysses suitors. father jove, minerva, and
 apollo, ulysses still man wrestled with

 nymph calypso, keeping prisoner, reach his
 home, ships sailors take sea.’ this
 menelaus told me, heard story came away;
 gods gave fair wind soon brought safe home again.”
 
words moved heart penelope. theoclymenus said
 her:
 
“madam, wife ulysses, telemachus understand things;
 listen therefore me, can divine surely, will hide
 nothing you. may jove king heaven witness, the
 rites hospitality, hearth ulysses now come,
 ulysses even now ithaca, and, either going the
 country staying one place, enquiring evil deeds
 preparing day reckoning suitors. saw omen i
 ship meant this, told telemachus it.”
 
“may even so,” answered penelope; “if words come true, you
 shall gifts good will see you
 shall congratulate you.”
 
thus converse. meanwhile suitors throwing discs, or
 aiming spears mark levelled ground front the
 house, behaving old insolence. now
 time dinner, flock sheep goats come the
 town country round, 140 shepherds usual,
 medon, favourite servant, waited upon them
 table, said, “now then, young masters, enough sport,
 come inside may get dinner ready. dinner bad thing,
 dinner time.”
 
left sports told them, within the
 house, laid cloaks benches seats inside, then
 sacrificed sheep, goats, pigs, heifer, fat and
 well grown.141 thus made ready meal. meantime
 ulysses swineherd starting town, the
 swineherd said, “stranger, suppose still want go town
 to-day, master said do; part have
 liked stay station hand, must master
 tells me, will scold later on, scolding one’s
 master serious thing. let us off, now broad
 day; will night directly will find it
 colder.”142
 
“i know, understand you,” replied ulysses; “you need say more.
 let us going, stick ready cut, let to
 walk with, say road rough one.”
 
spoke threw shabby old tattered wallet shoulders,
 cord hung, eumaeus gave stick his
 liking. two started, leaving station charge dogs
 herdsmen remained behind; swineherd led way his
 master followed after, looking like broken old tramp he
 leaned upon staff, clothes rags. had
 got rough steep ground nearing city, reached
 fountain citizens drew water. been
 made ithacus, neritus, polyctor. grove of
 water-loving poplars planted circle round it, clear
 cold water came rock high up,143 the
 fountain altar nymphs, wayfarers used

 driving goats, best flock, suitors’
 dinner, two shepherds him. saw eumaeus and
 ulysses reviled outrageous unseemly language, which
 made ulysses angry.
 
“there go,” cried he, “and precious pair are. see heaven
 brings birds feather one another. where, pray, master
 swineherd, taking poor miserable object? make any
 one sick see creature table. fellow like never won
 prize anything life, will go rubbing his

 taken bad ways will go kind work; he
 will nothing beg victuals town over, feed his
 insatiable belly. say, therefore—and shall surely be—if goes
 near ulysses’ house will get head broken stools will

this, passed, gave ulysses kick hip pure
 wantonness, ulysses stood firm, budge path.
 moment doubted whether fly melanthius kill him
 staff, fling ground beat brains out; he
 resolved, however, endure keep check, the
 swineherd looked straight melanthius rebuked him, lifting his
 hands praying heaven so.
 
“fountain nymphs,” cried, “children jove, ever ulysses burned
 thigh bones covered fat whether lambs kids, grant my
 prayer heaven may send home. soon put end the
 swaggering threats men go insulting
 people—gadding town flocks going ruin
 bad shepherding.”
 
melanthius goatherd answered, “you ill conditioned cur, what
 talking about? day will put board ship
 take foreign country, can sell pocket the
 money will fetch. wish sure apollo strike
 telemachus dead day, suitors kill him, i
 ulysses will never come home again.”
 
left come leisure, went
 quickly forward soon reached house master. got
 went took seat among suitors opposite
 eurymachus, liked better others. servants
 brought portion meat, upper woman servant set bread
 might eat. presently ulysses swineherd came
 house stood it, amid sound music, phemius was
 just beginning sing suitors. ulysses took hold the
 swineherd’s hand, said:
 
“eumaeus, house ulysses fine place. matter far
 go, will find like it. one building keeps following on
 another. outer court wall battlements round
 it; doors double folding, good workmanship; be
 hard matter take force arms. perceive, too, there
 many people banqueting within it, smell roast
 meat, hear sound music, gods made go along
 feasting.”
 
eumaeus said, “you perceived aright, indeed generally
 do; let us think will best course. will go inside
 first join suitors, leaving behind you, will you
 wait let go first? wait long, one may
 see loitering outside, throw something you. consider
 matter pray you.”
 
ulysses answered, “i understand heed. go first leave me
 am. quite used beaten things
 thrown me. much buffeted war that
 case-hardened, may go rest. man cannot
 hide away cravings hungry belly; enemy gives
 much trouble men; ships fitted
 sail seas, make war upon people.”
 
thus talking, dog lying asleep raised his
 head pricked ears. argos, ulysses bred
 setting troy, never work him.
 old days used taken young men went
 hunting wild goats, deer, hares, now master gone
 lying neglected heaps mule cow dung lay in
 front stable doors till men come draw away to
 manure great close; full fleas. soon saw
 ulysses standing there, dropped ears wagged tail, he
 get close master. ulysses saw dog the
 side yard, dashed tear eyes without eumaeus
 seeing it, said:
 
“eumaeus, noble hound yonder manure heap:
 build splendid; fine fellow looks, he
 one dogs come begging table, kept
 merely show?”
 
“this hound,” answered eumaeus, “belonged died far
 country. ulysses left troy, would
 soon show do. wild beast the
 forest get away tracks. but
 now fallen evil times, master dead gone, and
 women take care him. servants never work their
 master’s hand longer them, jove takes half goodness
 man makes slave him.”
 
spoke went inside buildings cloister the
 suitors were, argos died soon recognised master.
 
telemachus saw eumaeus long one else did, beckoned him
 come sit beside him; looked saw seat lying
 near carver sat serving portions suitors; he
 picked up, brought telemachus’s table, sat opposite
 him. servant brought portion, gave bread from
 bread-basket.
 
immediately afterwards ulysses came inside, looking like poor
 miserable old beggar, leaning staff clothes in
 rags. sat upon threshold ash-wood just inside doors
 leading outer inner court, bearing-post
 cypress-wood carpenter skilfully planed, made
 join truly rule line. telemachus took whole loaf the
 bread-basket, much meat hold two hands, and
 said eumaeus, “take stranger, tell go the
 round suitors, beg them; beggar must be
 shamefaced.”
 
eumaeus went said, “stranger, telemachus sends you
 this, says go round suitors begging, for
 beggars must shamefaced.”
 
ulysses answered, “may king jove grant happiness telemachus, and
 fulfil desire heart.”
 
hands took telemachus sent him, laid it
 dirty old wallet feet. went eating the
 bard singing, just finished dinner left off. the
 suitors applauded bard, whereon minerva went ulysses and
 prompted beg pieces bread one suitors, that
 might see kind people were, tell good the
 bad; come might going save single one of
 them. ulysses, therefore, went round, going left right,
 stretched hands beg though real beggar.
 pitied him, curious him, asking one another
 came from; whereon goatherd melanthius
 said, “suitors noble mistress, can tell something about
 him, seen before. swineherd brought here, i
 know nothing man himself, comes from.”
 
antinous began abuse swineherd. “you precious idiot,” he
 cried, “what brought man town for? tramps
 beggars enough already pester us sit meat? think
 small thing people gather waste master’s
 property—and must needs bring man well?”
 
eumaeus answered, “antinous, birth good words
 evil. mine came here. likely to
 invite stranger foreign country, unless one who
 can public service seer, healer hurts, carpenter, a
 bard can charm us singing? men welcome the
 world over, one likely ask beggar will worry
 him. always harder ulysses’ servants other
 suitors are, me, care long as
 telemachus penelope alive here.”
 
telemachus said, “hush, answer him; antinous the
 bitterest tongue suitors, makes others worse.”
 
turning antinous said, “antinous, take much care of
 interests though son. want see this
 stranger turned house? heaven forbid; take something and
 give yourself; grudge it; bid take it. never mind
 mother, servants house; know you
 will say, fond eating things yourself
 giving people.”
 
“what mean, telemachus,” replied antinous, “by swaggering
 talk? suitors give much will, would
 come another three months.”
 
spoke drew stool rested dainty feet from
 table, made though throw ulysses, but
 suitors gave something, filled wallet with
 bread meat; about, therefore, go back threshold
 eat suitors given him, first went to
 antinous said:
 
“sir, give something; not, surely, poorest man here; you
 seem chief, foremost among all; therefore be
 better giver, will tell far wide bounty. too
 rich man once, fine house own; days i
 gave many tramp now am, matter might nor
 wanted. number servants, things
 people live well accounted wealthy, it
 pleased jove take away me. sent band roving
 robbers egypt; long voyage undone it. i
 stationed ships river aegyptus, bade men stay them
 keep guard them, sent scouts reconnoitre from
 every point vantage.
 
“but men disobeyed orders, took devices, and
 ravaged land egyptians, killing men, taking their
 wives children captives. alarm soon carried city,
 heard war-cry, people came daybreak till
 plain filled soldiers horse foot, gleam
 armour. jove spread panic among men, no
 longer face enemy, found surrounded. the
 egyptians killed many us, took rest alive forced
 labour them; myself, gave friend met them,
 take cyprus, dmetor name, iasus, great man in
 cyprus. thence come hither state great misery.”
 
antinous said, “what god can sent pestilence plague
 us dinner? get out, open part court,145 i
 will give egypt cyprus insolence and
 importunity; begged others, given you
 lavishly, abundance round them, easy free
 people’s property plenty it.”
 
ulysses began move off, said, “your looks, fine sir,
 better breeding; house would
 spare poor man much pinch salt, though in
 another man’s, surrounded abundance, find you
 give even piece bread.”
 
made antinous angry, scowled saying, “you shall
 pay get clear court.” words he
 threw footstool him, hit right shoulder blade near
 top back. ulysses stood firm rock blow not
 even stagger him, shook head silence brooded his
 revenge. went back threshold sat there, laying
 well filled wallet feet.
 
“listen me,” cried, “you suitors queen penelope, may
 speak even minded. man knows neither ache pain gets
 hit fighting money, sheep cattle; and
 even antinous hit service miserable belly,
 always getting people trouble. still, poor have
 gods avenging deities all, pray antinous may come to
 bad end marriage.”
 
“sit are, eat victuals silence, off
 elsewhere,” shouted antinous. “if say will dragged
 hand foot courts, servants shall flay you
 alive.”
 
suitors much displeased this, one young
 men said, “antinous, ill striking poor wretch a
 tramp: will worse turn some
 god—and know gods go disguised sorts ways as
 people foreign countries, travel world see do
 amiss righteously.”146
 
thus said suitors, antinous paid heed. meanwhile
 telemachus furious blow given his
 father, though tear fell him, shook head silence
 brooded revenge.
 
now penelope heard beggar struck the
 banqueting-cloister, said maids, “would apollo
 strike you, antinous,” waiting woman eurynome
 answered, “if prayers answered one suitors would
 ever see sun rise.” penelope said, “nurse,147 hate
 every single one them, mean nothing mischief, i
 hate antinous like darkness death itself. poor unfortunate
 tramp come begging house sheer want. every one else
 given something put wallet, antinous hit him
 right shoulder-blade footstool.”
 
thus talk maids sat room, the
 meantime ulysses getting dinner. called the
 swineherd said, “eumaeus, go tell stranger come here, i
 want see ask questions. seems travelled
 much, may seen heard something unhappy husband.”
 
answered, swineherd eumaeus, “if achaeans, madam,
 keep quiet, charmed history his
 adventures. three days three nights hut,
 first place reached running away ship,
 yet completed story misfortunes. had
 heaven-taught minstrel whole world, whose lips
 hearers hang entranced, charmed sat

 house ulysses, comes crete
 descendants minos live, driven hither
 thither every kind misfortune; also declares has
 heard ulysses alive near hand among the
 thesprotians, bringing great wealth home him.”
 
“call here, then,” said penelope, “that may hear story.
 suitors, let take pleasure indoors they
 will, nothing fret about. corn wine remain
 unwasted houses none servants consume them, while
 keep hanging house day day sacrificing oxen,
 sheep, fat goats banquets, never giving much a
 thought quantity wine drink. estate can stand such
 recklessness, now ulysses protect us. to
 come again, soon revenge.”
 
spoke telemachus sneezed loudly whole house
 resounded it. penelope laughed heard this, said to
 eumaeus, “go call stranger; hear sneezed
 just speaking? can mean suitors are
 going killed, one shall escape. furthermore
 say, lay saying heart: satisfied the
 stranger speaking truth shall give shirt cloak of
 good wear.”
 
eumaeus heard went straight ulysses said, “father
 stranger, mistress penelope, mother telemachus, sent you;
 great grief, wishes hear anything can tell her
 husband, satisfied speaking the
 truth, will give shirt cloak, things
 want of. bread, can get enough that
 fill belly, begging town, letting give
 will.”
 
“i will tell penelope,” answered ulysses, “nothing strictly
 true. know husband, partner in
 affliction, afraid passing crowd cruel
 suitors, pride insolence reach heaven. just now,
 moreover, going house without harm, man
 gave blow hurt much, neither telemachus any
 one else defended me. tell penelope, therefore, patient wait
 till sundown. let give seat close fire, my
 clothes worn thin—you know are, seen them
 ever since first asked help me—she can ask the
 return husband.”
 
swineherd went back heard this, penelope said she
 saw cross threshold, “why bring here, eumaeus?
 afraid one will ill-treat him, shy coming
 inside house all? beggars shamefaced.”
 
answered, swineherd eumaeus, “the stranger quite
 reasonable. avoiding suitors, one
 else do. asks wait till sundown, will much
 better, madam, yourself, can
 hear talk will.”
 
“the man fool,” answered penelope, “it likely he
 says, abominable people whole world as
 men are.”
 
done speaking eumaeus went back suitors, had
 explained everything. went telemachus said ear
 none overhear him, “my dear sir, will now go back to
 pigs, see property business. will look
 going here, careful keep of
 danger, many bear ill will. may jove bring them
 bad end us mischief.”
 
“very well,” replied telemachus, “go home your
 dinner, morning come victims to
 sacrifice day. leave rest heaven me.”
 
eumaeus took seat again, finished his
 dinner left courts cloister men table, and
 went back pigs. suitors, presently began to
 amuse singing dancing, now getting on
 towards evening.

fight irus—ulysses warns amphinomus—penelope gets presents
 suitors—the braziers—ulysses rebukes eurymachus.
 

now came certain common tramp used go begging over
 city ithaca, notorious incorrigible glutton and
 drunkard. man strength stay him, great
 hulking fellow look at; real name, one mother gave him,
 arnaeus, young men place called irus,148 because
 used run errands one send him. soon he
 came began insult ulysses, try drive his
 house.
 
“be off, old man,” cried, “from doorway, shall dragged
 neck heels. see giving the
 wink, wanting turn force, like do
 so? get then, go yourself, shall come blows.”
 
ulysses frowned said, “my friend, manner of
 harm; people give great deal, jealous. room
 enough doorway pair us, need grudge me
 things give. seem just another
 tramp myself, perhaps gods will give us better luck and
 by. not, however, talk much fighting will incense
 me, old though am, shall cover mouth chest blood.

 house ulysses more.”
 
irus angry answered, “you filthy glutton, run on
 trippingly like old fish-fag. good mind lay hands
 you, knock teeth head like many boar’s
 tusks. get ready, therefore, let people stand and
 look on. will never able fight one much younger
 yourself.”
 
thus roundly rate one another smooth pavement front
 doorway,149 antinous saw going laughed
 heartily said others, “this finest sport you
 ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like house. the
 stranger irus quarreled going fight, let us set
 once.”
 
suitors came laughing, gathered round two ragged
 tramps. “listen me,” said antinous, “there goats’ paunches
 fire, filled blood fat, set
 aside supper; victorious proves the
 better man shall pick lot; shall free our
 table will allow beggar house all.”
 
others agreed, ulysses, throw scent, said,
 “sirs, old man like myself, worn suffering, hold his
 young one; irrepressible belly urges on, though
 know can end getting drubbing. must swear,
 however none will give foul blow favour irus and
 secure victory.”
 
swore told them, completed oath
 telemachus put word said, “stranger, mind to
 settle fellow, need afraid one here.
 whoever strikes will fight one. host, and
 chiefs, antinous eurymachus, men of
 understanding, mind am.”
 
every one assented, ulysses girded old rags loins,
 thus baring stalwart thighs, broad chest shoulders, his
 mighty arms; minerva came made limbs even
 stronger still. suitors beyond measure astonished, one
 turn towards neighbour saying, “the stranger brought such
 thigh old rags will soon nothing left of
 irus.”
 
irus began uneasy heard them, servants girded
 force, brought [into open part court] such
 fright limbs tremble. antinous scolded and
 said, “you swaggering bully, never born all
 afraid old broken creature tramp is.
 say, therefore—and shall surely be—if beats proves
 better man, shall pack board ship the
 mainland send king echetus, kills every one comes
 near him. will cut nose ears, draw your
 entrails dogs eat.”
 
frightened irus still more, brought middle
 court, two men raised hands fight. ulysses
 considered whether let drive hard make end
 there, whether give lighter blow
 knock down; end deemed best give
 lighter blow fear achaeans begin suspect he
 was. began fight, irus hit ulysses right
 shoulder; ulysses gave irus blow neck ear that
 broke bones skull, blood came gushing his
 mouth; fell groaning dust, gnashing teeth kicking on
 ground, suitors threw hands nearly died of
 laughter, ulysses caught hold foot dragged him
 outer court far gate-house. propped up
 wall put staff hands. “sit here,” said he,
 “and keep dogs pigs off; pitiful creature, you
 try make king beggars shall fare still
 worse.”
 
threw dirty old wallet, tattered torn his
 shoulder cord hung, went back sit upon
 threshold; suitors went within cloisters, laughing and
 saluting him, “may jove, gods,” said they, “grant you
 whatever want put end importunity this
 insatiable tramp. will take mainland presently, to
 king echetus, kills every one comes near him.”
 
ulysses hailed good omen, antinous set great goat’s
 paunch filled blood fat. amphinomus took two loaves
 bread-basket brought him, pledging did
 golden goblet wine. “good luck you,” said, “father
 stranger, badly present, hope will have
 better times by.”
 
ulysses answered, “amphinomus, seem man good

“i know, eurynome,” replied penelope, “that mean well, not

old woman150 went room bid maids go to

 couch limbs became heavy sleep. goddess shed

“what exquisitely delicious sleep having,” said she, as

“telemachus,” said she, addressing son, “i fear longer

thus converse. eurymachus came said, “queen

penelope replied, “eurymachus, heaven robbed my

said, ulysses glad heard trying

antinous said, “queen penelope, daughter icarius, take many

 well refuse present; will go business nor

others applauded antinous said, one sent his

 lovely dress exquisitely embroidered. twelve beautifully
 made brooch pins pure gold fasten it. eurymachus
 immediately brought magnificent chain gold amber beads
 gleamed like sunlight. eurydamas’s two men returned some
 earrings fashioned three brilliant pendants glistened most
 beautifully; king pisander polyctor gave necklace of
 rarest workmanship, every one else brought beautiful

queen went back room upstairs, maids brought
 presents her. meanwhile suitors took singing and
 dancing, stayed till evening came. danced sang till it
 grew dark; brought three braziers151 give light, and
 piled chopped firewood old dry, lit

 ulysses said:
 
“maids, servants ulysses long absent, go the

maids looked one another laughed, pretty melantho

“poor wretch,” said she, “are gone clean mind? go and

“vixen,” replied ulysses, scowling her, “i will go tell
 telemachus saying, will torn limb

words scared women, went body

 said. ulysses took stand near burning braziers, holding
 torches looking people—brooding things that
 surely come pass.
 
minerva let suitors one moment cease their
 insolence, wanted ulysses become even bitter against
 them; therefore set eurymachus polybus gibe him,
 made others laugh. “listen me,” said he, “you suitors of
 queen penelope, may speak even minded. for
 nothing man come house ulysses; believe the
 light coming torches, head—for

turning ulysses said, “stranger, will work servant,

“eurymachus,” answered ulysses, “if work one against

eurymachus furious this. scowled cried, “you

 ulysses sought protection knees amphinomus dulichium, for

telemachus came forward said, “sirs, mad? can you

suitors bit lips marvelled boldness speech;

telemachus ulysses remove armour—ulysses interviews

ulysses left cloister, pondering means whereby with
 minerva’s help might able kill suitors. presently said
 telemachus, “telemachus, must get armour together take it

“i wish, child,” answered euryclea, “that take management

“the stranger,” said telemachus, “shall show light; people

euryclea told, bolted women inside room.
 ulysses made haste take helmets, shields,

 hand shed soft brilliant radiance, whereon telemachus said,
 “father, eyes behold great marvel: walls, rafters,

“hush,” answered ulysses, “hold peace ask questions, for

telemachus went torch-light side inner

 means whereby minerva’s help might able kill suitors.
 
penelope came room looking like venus diana, and
 set seat inlaid scrolls silver ivory near the

penelope heard saying scolded maid, “impudent

said head waiting woman eurynome, “bring seat a

eurynome brought seat set fleece upon it, soon

“madam,” answered ulysses, “who face whole earth can dare

spoke shed sleep eyes, went back to
 olympus.
 
ulysses thus yielding deep slumber that
 eased burden sorrows, admirable wife awoke, sitting

 prayed diana saying, “great goddess diana, daughter jove,

 long can sleep night, eyes closed in
 slumber people forget good ill alike; whereas misery haunts me
 even dreams. night methought one lying my
 side like ulysses went away host,
 rejoiced, believed dream, truth
 itself.”
 
day broke, ulysses heard sound weeping, and
 puzzled him, seemed though already knew by
 side. gathered cloak fleeces had
 lain, set seat cloister, took bullock’s
 hide open. lifted hands heaven, prayed,
 saying “father jove, since seen fit bring land and
 home afflictions laid upon me,
 give sign mouth one are
 now waking within house, let another sign kind

thus pray. jove heard prayer forthwith thundered high up
 among clouds splendour olympus, ulysses glad
 heard it. time within house, miller-woman

 “father jove,” said she, “you, rule heaven earth, have

 servant calls upon you, let last day the
 suitors dine house ulysses. worn labour
 grinding meal them, hope may never another

ulysses glad heard omens conveyed woman’s
 speech, thunder, knew meant should
 avenge suitors.
 
maids house rose lit fire hearth;
 telemachus also rose put clothes. girded sword about
 shoulder, bound sandals comely feet, took a
 doughty spear point sharpened bronze; went the
 threshold cloister said euryclea, “nurse, make
 stranger comfortable regards bed board, let
 shift himself?—for mother, good woman though is, a
 way paying great attention second-rate people, neglecting
 others reality much better men.”
 
“do find fault child,” said euryclea, “when one find

telemachus went court place achaeans
 meeting assembly; spear hand, not
 alone, two dogs went him. euryclea called maids
 said, “come, wake up; set sweeping cloisters and
 sprinkling water lay dust; put covers the
 seats; wipe tables, you, wet sponge; clean out
 mixing-jugs cups, go water fountain at
 once; suitors will directly; will early, for
 feast day.”
 
thus speak, even said: twenty them
 went fountain water, others set busily to
 work house. men attendance suitors
 also came began chopping firewood. women returned
 fountain, swineherd came three
 best pigs pick out. let feed premises, and
 said good-humouredly ulysses, “stranger, suitors
 treating better now, insolent ever?”
 
“may heaven,” answered ulysses, “requite wickedness with
 deal high-handedly another man’s house without sense
 shame.”
 
thus converse; meanwhile melanthius goatherd came up, for
 bringing best goats suitors’ dinner; he

 melanthius began gibing ulysses. “are still here,
 stranger,” said he, “to pester people begging house? why
 can go elsewhere? shall come understanding

 achaeans, well here?”
 
ulysses made answer, bowed head brooded. third
 man, philoetius, joined them, bringing barren heifer and
 goats. brought boatmen to
 take people one comes them. philoetius made his
 heifer goats secure gatehouse, went to
 swineherd. “who, swineherd,” said he, “is stranger is

“if jove bring pass,” replied stockman, “you should

like manner eumaeus prayed ulysses might return home.
 
thus converse. meanwhile suitors hatching plot to
 murder telemachus: bird flew near left hand—an
 eagle dove talons. amphinomus said, “my friends,
 plot murder telemachus will succeed; let us go to
 dinner instead.”
 
others assented, went inside laid cloaks the
 benches seats. sacrificed sheep, goats, pigs, the
 heifer, inward meats cooked served round.
 mixed wine mixing-bowls, swineherd gave every
 man cup, philoetius handed round bread bread
 baskets, melanthius poured wine. laid
 hands upon good things them.
 
telemachus purposely made ulysses sit part cloister that
 paved stone;158 gave shabby looking seat little
 table himself, portion inward meats brought to
 him, wine gold cup. “sit there,” said he, “and drink your
 wine among great people. will put stop gibes blows
 suitors, public house, belongs ulysses,
 passed me. therefore, suitors, keep hands and
 tongues yourselves, will mischief.”
 
suitors bit lips, marvelled boldness his
 speech; antinous said, “we like language will
 put it, telemachus threatening us good earnest. if
 jove let us put stop brave talk ere now.”
 
thus spoke antinous, telemachus heeded not. meanwhile the
 heralds bringing holy hecatomb city, the
 achaeans gathered shady grove apollo.
 
roasted outer meat, drew spits, gave every man
 portion, feasted heart’s content; waited at
 table gave ulysses exactly portion others had, for
 telemachus told so.
 
minerva let suitors one moment drop their
 insolence, wanted ulysses become still bitter against
 them. now happened among ribald fellow, whose name
 ctesippus, came same. man, confident great
 wealth, paying court wife ulysses, said the
 suitors, “hear say. stranger already as
 large portion one else; well, right nor
 reasonable ill-treat guest telemachus comes here. will,
 however, make present account, may have
 something give bath-woman, ulysses’
 servants.”
 
spoke picked heifer’s foot meat-basket which
 lay, threw ulysses, ulysses turned head little
 aside, avoided it, smiling grimly sardinian fashion159 did
 so, hit wall, him. telemachus spoke fiercely to
 ctesippus, “it good thing you,” said he, “that stranger

held peace till last agelaus damastor said,
 “no one take offence just said, gainsay it,

telemachus answered, “by jove, agelaus, sorrows of

 wandering distant land, throw obstacles way my
 mother’s marriage; contrary urge choose whomsoever she

minerva now made suitors fall laughing immoderately, set
 wits wandering; laughing forced laughter.

 hearts heavy forebodings. theoclymenus saw and
 said, “unhappy men, ails you? shroud of

telemachus gave heed, sat silently watching father,
 expecting every moment begin attack upon suitors.
 
meanwhile daughter icarius, wise penelope, rich seat

 jove’s hercules killed iphitus ere so. bow,
 then, given iphitus, taken ulysses when

penelope presently reached oak threshold store-room; the

 reached suitors, stood one bearing-posts
 supporting roof cloister, holding veil face,

“listen suitors, persist abusing hospitality of

 pretext want marry me; this, then, prize
 contending for, will bring mighty bow of
 ulysses, whomsoever shall string easily send his
 arrow one twelve axes, will follow quit this

 even doubt shall remember dreams.”
 
spoke, told eumaeus set bow pieces iron
 suitors, eumaeus wept took had
 bidden him. hard by, stockman wept also saw master’s
 bow, antinous scolded them. “you country louts,” said he, “silly
 simpletons; add sorrows mistress by

said, time expecting able to

 dishonouring house—egging others so

telemachus spoke. “great heavens!” exclaimed, “jove must have

spoke sprang seat, threw crimson cloak him,
 took sword shoulder. first set axes row,

put bow down, letting lean door [that led

 said:
 
“come turn, going towards right the

 mixing-bowl. 163 man hated evil deeds was
 indignant others. now first take bow and
 arrow, went pavement make trial, could
 string bow, hands weak unused hard work,
 therefore soon grew tired, said suitors, “my
 friends, string it; let another it, bow shall take

put bow down, letting lean door,164 with
 arrow standing tip bow. took seat
 seat risen; antinous rebuked him
 saying:
 
“leiodes, talking about? words monstrous and
 intolerable; makes angry listen you. shall, then, bow
 take life many chief among us, merely bend

 others will soon string it.”
 
said melanthius goatherd, “look sharp, light fire in
 court, set seat hard sheep skin it; bring us
 also large ball lard, house. let us
 warm bow grease it—we will make trial again, and
 bring contest end.”
 
melanthius lit fire, set seat covered sheep skins beside
 it. also brought great ball lard the
 house, suitors warmed bow made trial it, but
 none nearly strong enough string it. nevertheless
 still remained antinous eurymachus, ringleaders
 among suitors much foremost among all.
 
swineherd stockman left cloisters together, and
 ulysses followed them. got outside gates the
 outer yard, ulysses said quietly:
 
“stockman, swineherd, something mind in
 doubt whether say no; think will say it. manner of
 men stand ulysses, god bring back
 sudden? say disposed do—to side the
 suitors, ulysses?”
 
“father jove,” answered stockman, “would indeed might so
 ordain it. god bring ulysses back, see
 might main fight him.”
 
like words eumaeus prayed gods ulysses might return;
 when, therefore, saw certain mind of, ulysses
 said, “it i, ulysses, here. suffered much, at
 last, twentieth year, come back country. find
 two alone servants glad so, for

spoke drew rags aside great scar, they
 examined thoroughly, wept ulysses, threw
 arms round him, kissed head shoulders, ulysses
 kissed hands faces return. sun gone down
 upon mourning ulysses checked said:
 
“cease weeping, lest one come outside see us, and
 tell within. go in, separately, both
 together; will go first, follow afterwards; let this
 moreover token us; suitors will try to
 prevent getting hold bow quiver; you, therefore,
 eumaeus, place hands carrying about, tell

 come out; must keep quiet, stay work.
 charge you, philoetius, make fast doors outer
 court, bind securely once.”
 
thus spoken, went back house took seat
 left. presently, two servants followed inside.
 
moment bow hands eurymachus, warming
 fire, even string it, greatly
 grieved. heaved deep sigh said, “i grieve for
 us all; grieve shall forgo marriage, not
 care nearly much this, plenty women in
 ithaca elsewhere; feel fact so
 inferior ulysses strength string bow. this
 will disgrace us eyes yet unborn.”
 
“it shall so, eurymachus,” said antinous, “and know it
 yourself. today feast apollo throughout land; can
 string bow day this? put one side—as axes
 can stay are, one likely come house
 take away: let cupbearer go round cups, we
 may make drink-offerings drop matter bow; will
 tell melanthius bring us goats tomorrow—the best has; we
 can offer thigh bones apollo mighty archer, make
 trial bow, bring contest end.”
 
rest approved words, thereon men servants poured water over
 hands guests, pages filled mixing-bowls wine
 water handed round giving every man his
 drink-offering. then, made offerings drunk
 much desired, ulysses craftily said:—
 
“suitors illustrious queen, listen may speak even am
 minded. appeal especially eurymachus, antinous has
 just spoken much reason. cease shooting present and
 leave matter gods, morning let heaven give
 victory will. moment, however, give bow that
 may prove power hands among all, see whether i
 still much strength used have, whether travel and
 neglect made end it.”
 
made angry, feared might string bow,
 antinous therefore rebuked fiercely saying, “wretched creature, you
 much grain sense whole body; to
 think lucky allowed dine unharmed among your
 betters, without smaller portion served others
 had, allowed hear conversation. other
 beggar stranger allowed hear say among
 ourselves; wine must mischief, does

 centaur eurytion staying peirithous among the
 lapithae. wine got head, went mad ill

 assembled, rushed cut ears and

 went away crazed, bore burden crime, bereft of

 centaurs, brought upon own
 drunkenness. like manner can tell will go hardly with
 string bow: will find mercy one here,
 shall ship king echetus, kills every one
 comes near him: will never get away alive, drink keep
 quiet without getting quarrel men younger yourself.”
 
penelope spoke him. “antinous,” said she, “it right that
 ill-treat guest telemachus comes house.
 stranger prove strong enough string mighty bow of
 ulysses, can suppose take home make
 wife? even man can idea mind:
 none need let disturb feasting; all
 reason.”
 
“queen penelope,” answered eurymachus, “we suppose man
 will take away him; impossible; afraid lest
 baser sort, men women among achaeans, go
 gossiping say, ‘these suitors feeble folk; are
 paying court wife brave man whose bow one was
 able string, yet beggarly tramp came house strung
 sent arrow iron.’ will be
 said, will scandal us.”
 
“eurymachus,” penelope answered, “people persist eating the
 estate great chieftain dishonouring house must expect
 others think well them. mind men talk as
 think will? stranger strong well-built, says
 moreover noble birth. give bow, let us see
 whether can string no. say—and shall surely be—that if
 apollo vouchsafes glory stringing it, will give a
 cloak shirt good wear, javelin keep dogs and
 robbers, sharp sword. will also give sandals, will see
 sent safely wherever wants go.”
 
telemachus said, “mother, man either ithaca in
 islands elis right let one
 bow refuse it. one shall force one way the
 other, even though choose make stranger present the
 bow outright, let take away him. go, then, within the
 house busy daily duties, loom, your
 distaff, ordering servants. bow man’s matter,
 mine others, master here.”
 
went wondering back house, laid son’s saying in
 heart. going upstairs handmaids room, she
 mourned dear husband till minerva sent sweet sleep her
 eyelids.
 
swineherd now took bow taking ulysses, but
 suitors clamoured parts cloisters, one
 said, “you idiot, taking bow to? out
 wits? apollo gods will grant prayer, your
 boarhounds shall get quiet little place, worry
 death.”
 
eumaeus frightened outcry raised, put bow
 there, telemachus shouted other
 side cloisters, threatened saying, “father eumaeus,
 bring bow spite them, young will pelt you
 stones back country, better man two. i
 wish much stronger suitors house as
 you, soon send sick sorry, for
 mean mischief.”
 
thus speak, laughed heartily, put
 better humour telemachus; eumaeus brought bow on
 placed hands ulysses. done this, called
 euryclea apart said her, “euryclea, telemachus says to
 close doors women’s apartments. hear groaning or
 uproar men fighting house, come out,
 keep quiet stay work.”
 
euryclea told closed doors women’s
 apartments.
 
meanwhile philoetius slipped quietly made fast gates the
 outer court. ship’s cable byblus fibre lying the
 gatehouse, made gates fast came again,
 resuming seat left, keeping eye ulysses, who
 now got bow hands, turning every way about,

another said, “i hope may successful things than
 likely stringing bow.”
 
ulysses, taken examined over, strung
 easily skilled bard strings new peg lyre makes

 prove string, sang sweetly touch like the
 twittering swallow. suitors dismayed, turned colour
 heard it; moment, moreover, jove thundered loudly a

took arrow lying upon table165—for the

thus spoke, thought killed antinous by

“dogs, think come back troy? have

 neither god man, now shall die.”
 
turned pale fear spoke, every man looked round
 see whither might fly safety, eurymachus alone
 spoke.
 
“if ulysses,” said he, “then said just. we

“my friends, man will give us quarter. will stand he

amphinomus drew sword made straight ulysses try and

 struck behind; spear caught shoulders and
 went right chest, fell heavily ground and
 struck earth forehead. telemachus sprang away from
 him, leaving spear still body, feared he

 immediately father’s side. said:
 
“father, let bring shield, two spears, brass helmet for

“run fetch them,” answered ulysses, “while arrows hold out, or

telemachus father said, went store room where
 armour kept. chose four shields, eight spears, four
 brass helmets horse-hair plumes. brought speed to
 father, armed first, stockman the
 swineherd also put armour, took places near ulysses.
 meanwhile ulysses, long arrows lasted, shooting the
 suitors one one, fell thick one another: arrows
 gave out, set bow stand end wall house by

telemachus answered, “the fault, father, mine, mine only; left

thus converse. meanwhile melanthius going the

ulysses answered, “telemachus will hold suitors check,

thus converse, presently mercury came the
 ghosts suitors killed ulysses. ghosts of
 agamemnon achilles astonished seeing them, went to

 melaneus, lived ithaca host, began to
 talk him.
 
“amphimedon,” said, “what happened fine young men—all

 ulysses long gone, courting wife, not

“go house, kill best pig can find dinner.

 best crafty him, mind went father,
 bending digging plant.
 
“i see, sir,” said ulysses, “that excellent gardener—what

 fig tree, vine, olive, pear, flower bed, bears trace of

 cup solid silver flowers chased upon it. gave twelve
 light cloaks, many pieces tapestry; also gave twelve
 cloaks single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, equal
 number shirts. added four good looking women skilled
 useful arts, let take choice.”
 
father shed tears answered, “sir, indeed come the
 country named, fallen hands wicked
 people. wealth presents given purpose. if
 found friend alive ithaca, have
 entertained hospitably requited presents amply
 left him—as right considering you
 already given him. tell me, tell true, many years is

 offices due departed. now, tell truly want know.
 whence you—tell town parents? the
 ship lying brought men ithaca? a

“i will tell everything,” answered ulysses, “quite truly. come

 will. ship lying yonder, open
 country outside town, fifth year since ulysses left
 country. poor fellow, yet omens good left
 me. birds flew right hands, rejoiced
 see parted, every hope have
 another friendly meeting exchange presents.”
 
dark cloud sorrow fell upon laertes listened. filled both
 hands dust ground poured grey
 head, groaning heavily so. heart ulysses touched,
 nostrils quivered looked upon father; sprang
 towards him, flung arms kissed him, saying, “i he,
 father, asking—i returned been
 away twenty years. cease sighing lamentation—we have
 time lose, tell killing the
 suitors house, punish insolence crimes.”
 
“if really ulysses,” replied laertes, “and come
 back again, must give manifest proof identity as
 shall convince me.”
 
“first observe scar,” answered ulysses, “which got boar’s
 tusk hunting mt. parnassus. mother sent me
 autolycus, mother’s father, receive presents he
 promised give me. furthermore will point out
 trees vineyard gave me, asked all
 followed round garden. went all,
 told names were. gave me
 thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, forty fig trees; also
 said give fifty rows vines; corn planted
 row, yield grapes every kind heat of
 heaven laid heavy upon them.”
 
laertes’ strength failed heard convincing proofs which
 given him. threw arms him, ulysses to
 support him, gone swoon; soon he
 came to, beginning recover senses, said, “o father
 jove, gods still olympus all, suitors have
 really punished insolence folly. nevertheless, am
 much afraid shall townspeople ithaca here
 directly, will sending messengers everywhere throughout the
 cities cephallenians.”
 
ulysses answered, “take heart trouble that,
 let us go house hard garden. already told
 telemachus, philoetius, eumaeus go get dinner ready
 soon possible.”
 
thus conversing two made way towards house. got

 good cloak, minerva came gave imposing
 presence, making taller stouter before. came back
 surprised see looking like immortal, said
 him, “my dear father, one gods making much

 killed great many them, rejoiced
 see it.”
 
thus converse; others, finished their
 work feast ready, left working, took his
 proper place benches seats. began eating; and
 old dolius sons left work came up, their
 mother, sicel woman looked laertes now was
 growing old, fetch them. saw ulysses were
 certain he, stood lost astonishment; ulysses
 scolded good naturedly said, “sit dinner, old
 man, never mind surprise; wanting begin
 time waiting you.”
 
dolius put hands went ulysses. “sir,” said
 he, seizing master’s hand kissing wrist, “we have
 long wishing home: now heaven restored us after
 given hoping. hail, therefore, may gods prosper
 you.187 tell me, penelope already know return, or
 shall send one tell her?”
 
“old man,” answered ulysses, “she knows already, need not
 trouble that.” took seat, sons dolius
 gathered round ulysses give greeting embrace one after
 other; took seats due order near dolius their
 father.
 
thus busy getting dinner ready, rumour went round
 town, noised abroad terrible fate befallen the
 suitors; soon, therefore, people heard gathered
 every quarter, groaning hooting house ulysses.
 took dead away, buried every man own, put bodies
 came elsewhere board fishing vessels, the
 fishermen take place. met angrily
 place assembly, got together eupeithes
 rose speak. overwhelmed grief death son
 antinous, first man killed ulysses, said,
 weeping bitterly, “my friends, man done achaeans great
 wrong. took many best men away fleet, he
 lost ships men; now, moreover, return been
 killing foremost men among cephallenians. let us and
 can get away pylos elis epeans rule,
 shall ashamed ever afterwards. will an
 everlasting disgrace us avenge murder sons
 brothers. part pleasure life,
 rather die once. let us up, then, them, before
 can cross main land.”
 
wept spoke every one pitied him. medon bard
 phemius now woke up, came house ulysses.
 every one astonished seeing them, stood middle
 assembly, medon said, “hear me, men ithaca. ulysses did
 things will heaven. saw an
 immortal god take form mentor stand beside him. god
 appeared, now front encouraging him, now going furiously
 court attacking suitors whereon fell thick on
 one another.”
 
pale fear laid hold them, old halitherses, of
 mastor, rose speak, man among knew both
 past future; spoke plainly honesty,
 saying,
 
“men ithaca, fault things turned as
 have; listen me, yet mentor, bade
 check folly sons much wrong the
 wantonness hearts—wasting substance dishonouring the
 wife chieftain thought return. now, however,
 let say, tell you. go against
 ulysses, may find drawing evil your
 heads.”
 
said, half raised loud shout, at
 left assembly. rest stayed were, the
 speech halitherses displeased them, sided eupeithes;
 therefore hurried armour, armed
 themselves, met together front city, eupeithes led
 folly. thought going avenge murder of
 son, whereas truth never return, to
 perish attempt.
 
minerva said jove, “father, saturn, king kings,
 answer question—what propose do? will set them
 fighting still further, will make peace them?”
 
jove answered, “my child, ask me? your
 arrangement ulysses came home took revenge upon the
 suitors? whatever like, will tell think will be
 reasonable arrangement. now ulysses revenged, let them
 swear solemn covenant, virtue shall continue to
 rule, cause others forgive forget massacre of
 sons brothers. let become friends as
 heretofore, let peace plenty reign.”
 
minerva already eager bring about, she
 darted topmost summits olympus.
 
now laertes others done dinner, ulysses began by
 saying, “some go see getting close to
 us.” one dolius’s sons went bid. standing the
 threshold see quite near, said ulysses, “here
 are, let us put armour once.”
 
put armour fast could—that say ulysses,
 three men, six sons dolius. laertes also dolius did
 same—warriors necessity spite grey hair. they
 put armour, opened gate sallied forth,
 ulysses leading way.
 
jove’s daughter minerva came them, assumed form
 voice mentor. ulysses glad saw her, said his
 telemachus, “telemachus, now fight an
 engagement, will show every man’s mettle, sure disgrace
 ancestors, eminent strength courage the
 world over.”
 
“you say truly, dear father,” answered telemachus, “and shall
 see, will, mind disgrace family.”
 
laertes delighted heard this. “good heavens,” exclaimed,
 “what day enjoying: indeed rejoice it. and
 grandson vying one another matter valour.”
 
minerva came close said, “son arceisius—-best
 friend world—pray blue-eyed damsel, jove
 father; poise spear hurl it.”
 
spoke infused fresh vigour him, prayed
 poised spear hurled it. hit eupeithes’ helmet, and
 spear went right it, helmet stayed not, his
 armour rang rattling round fell heavily ground.
 meantime ulysses fell upon front line foe and
 smote swords spears; indeed, killed
 every one them, prevented ever getting home again,
 minerva raised voice aloud, made every one pause. “men of
 ithaca,” cried, “cease dreadful war, settle matter at
 without bloodshed.”
 
pale fear seized every one; frightened their
 arms dropped hands fell upon ground sound of
 goddess’ voice, fled back city lives. but
 ulysses gave great cry, gathering together swooped down
 like soaring eagle. saturn sent thunderbolt fire
 fell just front minerva, said ulysses, “ulysses,
 noble laertes, stop warful strife, jove will angry
 you.”
 
thus spoke minerva, ulysses obeyed gladly. minerva assumed
 form voice mentor, presently made covenant peace
 two contending parties.

preface first edition
 

translation intended supplement work entitled “the
 authoress odyssey”, published 1897. give
 whole “odyssey” book without making unwieldy, i
 therefore epitomised translation, already completed and
 now publish full.
 
shall argue two main points dealt work just
 mentioned; nothing either add to, withdraw from, i
 written. points question are:
 
(1) “odyssey” written entirely at, drawn entirely
 from, place now called trapani west coast sicily, alike
 regards phaeacian ithaca scenes; voyages of
 ulysses, within easy reach sicily, solve themselves
 periplus island, practically trapani back to
 trapani, via lipari islands, straits messina, island
 pantellaria.
 
(2) poem entirely written young woman, lived
 place now called trapani, introduced work
 name nausicaa.
 
main arguments base first somewhat
 startling contentions, prominently repeatedly the
 english italian public ever since appeared (without rejoinder)
 “athenaeum” january 30 february 20, 1892. both
 contentions urged (also without rejoinder) johnian “eagle”
 lent october terms year. nothing i
 reply reached quarter, knowing anxiously
 endeavoured learn existence flaws argument,
 begin feel confidence that, flaws exist, should
 heard, rate them, now. without,
 therefore, moment pretending think scholars generally
 acquiesce conclusions, shall act thinking little likely
 gainsay will incumbent upon reply, and
 shall confine translating “odyssey” english readers,
 notes think will found useful. among would
 especially call attention one xxii. 465-473 lord grimthorpe
 kindly allowed make public.
 
repeated several illustrations used “the authoress of
 odyssey”, added two hope may bring outer court
 ulysses’ house vividly reader. like to
 explain presence man dog one illustration is
 accidental, observed till developed negative.
 appendix also reprinted paragraphs explanatory the
 plan ulysses’ house, together plan itself. reader is
 recommended study plan attention.
 
preface translation “iliad” given views
 main principles translator guided, and
 need repeat here, beyond pointing initial liberty
 translating poetry prose involves continual taking more
 less liberty throughout translation; much right in
 poetry wrong prose, exigencies readable prose the
 first things considered prose translation. reader,
 however, may see far departed strict construe, will
 print messrs. butcher lang’s translation sixty lines or
 “odyssey.” translation runs:
 
tell me, muse, man, ready need, wandered far and
 wide, sacked sacred citadel troy, many the
 men whose towns saw whose mind learnt, yea, many woes
 suffered heart deep, striving win life and
 return company. nay, even saved company,
 though desired sore. blindness own
 hearts perished, fools, devoured oxen helios hyperion:
 god took day returning. things,
 goddess, daughter zeus, whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,
 declare thou even unto us.
 
now rest, many fled sheer destruction, at
 home, escaped war sea, odysseus only, craving
 wife homeward path, lady nymph calypso
 held, fair goddess, hollow caves, longing him
 lord. now year come courses the
 seasons, wherein gods ordained return home
 ithaca, even quit labours, even among
 own; gods pity save poseidon, raged
 continually godlike odysseus, till came own
 country. howbeit poseidon now departed distant
 ethiopians, ethiopians sundered twain, the
 uttermost men, abiding hyperion sinks where
 rises. looked receive hecatomb bulls and
 rams, made merry sitting feast, gods
 gathered halls olympian zeus. among the
 father men gods began speak, bethought his
 heart noble aegisthus, agamemnon, far-famed
 orestes, slew. thinking upon spake among immortals:
 ‘lo now, vainly mortal men blame gods! us
 say comes evil, whereas even themselves, the
 blindness hearts, sorrows beyond is
 ordained. even late aegisthus, beyond was
 ordained, took wedded wife atreus, and
 killed lord return, sheer doom his
 eyes, since warned embassy hermes the
 keen-sighted, slayer argos, neither kill the
 man, woo wife. atreus shall avenged at
 hand orestes, soon shall come man’s estate and
 long country. spake hermes, yet prevailed on
 heart aegisthus, good will; now hath paid
 one price all.’
 
goddess, grey-eyed athene, answered him, saying: ‘o father,
 father cronides, throned highest; man assuredly
 lies death due; perish likewise work
 deeds! heart rent wise odysseus, hapless
 one, far friends long suffereth affliction
 sea-girt isle, navel sea, woodland isle,
 therein goddess hath habitation, daughter the
 wizard atlas, knows depths every sea, himself
 upholds tall pillars keep earth sky asunder. his
 daughter holds hapless man sorrow: ever with
 soft guileful tales wooing forgetfulness of
 ithaca. odysseus yearning see smoke leap
 upwards land, hath desire die. thee, thine
 heart regardeth all, olympian! what! odysseus by
 ships argives make thee free offering sacrifice in
 wide trojan land? wherefore wast thou wroth him, o
 zeus?’
 

“odyssey” (as every one knows) abounds passages borrowed from
 “iliad”; wished print slightly different type,
 marginal references “iliad,” marked this
 end ms. found, however, translation thus
 hopelessly scholasticised, abandoned intention. would
 nevertheless urge management university
 presses, render great service students they
 publish greek text “odyssey” iliadic passages
 printed different type, marginal references. given
 british museum copy “odyssey” iliadic passages
 underlined referred ms.; also given “iliad” marked
 odyssean passages, references; copies of
 “iliad” “odyssey” marked within easy reach
 students.
 
one present day discusses questions arisen
 round “iliad” since wolf’s time, without keeping well his
 reader’s mind “odyssey” demonstrably written one
 single neighbourhood, hence (even though nothing else pointed to
 conclusion) presumably one person only—that written
 certainly 750, probability 1000 b.c.—that the
 writer early poem demonstrably familiar the
 “iliad” now it, borrowing freely books whose
 genuineness impugned, admitted to
 homer—any one fails keep points readers,
 hardly dealing equitably them. one hand, who
 will mark “iliad” “odyssey” copies british
 museum referred to, will draw inference that
 common sense can draw presence many identical passages
 poems, will, believe, find difficulty assigning their
 proper value large number books continent that
 present enjoy considerable reputations. furthermore, this
 perhaps advantage better worth securing, will find many
 puzzles “odyssey” cease puzzle discovery they
 arise over-saturation “iliad.”
 
difficulties will also disappear soon development of
 poem writer’s mind understood. dealt at
 length pp. 251-261 “the authoress odyssey”. briefly,
 “odyssey” consists two distinct poems: (1) return of
 ulysses, alone muse asked sing opening lines of
 poem. poem includes phaeacian episode, account of
 ulysses’ adventures told books ix.-xii. consists of
 lines 1-79 (roughly) book i., line 28 book v., thence
 without intermission middle line 187 book xiii., which
 point original scheme abandoned.
 
(2) story penelope suitors, episode of
 telemachus’ voyage pylos. poem begins line 80 (roughly) of
 book i., continued end book iv., resumed till
 ulysses wakes middle line 187, book xiii., whence it
 continues end book xxiv.
 
“the authoress odyssey”, wrote:
 
introduction lines xi., 115-137 line ix., 535, the
 writing new council gods beginning book v., take
 place one removed book i., 1-79, only
 things done give even semblance unity old
 scheme new, conceal fact muse, being
 asked sing one subject, spend two-thirds time singing a
 different one, climax no-one asked her. for
 roughly return occupies eight books, penelope suitors
 sixteen.
 

believe substantially correct.
 
lastly, deal unimportant point, observe the
 leipsic teubner edition 894 makes books ii. iii. end a
 comma. stops things far recent date the
 “odyssey,” seem much use adhering text in
 small matter; still, spirit mere conservatism, have
 preferred so. [greek] beginnings books ii. and
 viii., [greek], beginning book vii. initial
 capitals edition far careful admit supposition of
 inadvertence, [greek] beginning books vi. xiii., and
 [greek] beginning book xvii. initial capitals, i
 determine. books “odyssey” initial capitals

gods council—minerva’s visit ithaca—the challenge from
 telemachus suitors.
 

tell me, muse, ingenious hero travelled far wide
 sacked famous town troy. many cities visit,
 many nations whose manners customs was
 acquainted; moreover suffered much trying save his
 life bring men safely home; might could
 save men, perished sheer folly in
 eating cattle sun-god hyperion; god prevented them
 ever reaching home. tell me, too, things, oh
 daughter jove, whatsoever source may know them.
 
now escaped death battle shipwreck got safely
 home except ulysses, he, though longing return his
 wife country, detained goddess calypso, got him
 large cave wanted marry him. years went by, there
 came time gods settled go back ithaca;
 even then, however, among people, troubles were
 yet over; nevertheless gods now begun pity him
 except neptune, still persecuted without ceasing not
 let get home.
 
now neptune gone ethiopians, world’s end,
 lie two halves, one looking west east.1 had
 gone accept hecatomb sheep oxen, enjoying
 festival; gods met house of
 olympian jove, sire gods men spoke first. moment
 thinking aegisthus, killed agamemnon’s son
 orestes; said gods:
 
“see now, men lay blame upon us gods nothing
 folly. look aegisthus; must needs make love to
 agamemnon’s wife unrighteously kill agamemnon, though knew
 death him; sent mercury warn do
 either things, inasmuch orestes sure take his
 revenge grew wanted return home. mercury told him
 good will listen, now paid for
 everything full.”
 
minerva said, “father, saturn, king kings, served
 aegisthus right, one else did; but
 aegisthus neither there; ulysses heart
 bleeds, think sufferings lonely sea-girt island,
 far away, poor man, friends. island covered with
 forest, middle sea, goddess lives there,
 daughter magician atlas, looks bottom the
 ocean, carries great columns keep heaven earth
 asunder. daughter atlas got hold poor unhappy ulysses,
 keeps trying every kind blandishment make forget his
 home, tired life, thinks nothing may
 see smoke chimneys. you, sir, take heed of
 this, yet ulysses troy propitiate you
 many burnt sacrifice? keep angry
 him?”
 
jove said, “my child, talking about? can forget
 ulysses capable man earth, more
 liberal offerings immortal gods live heaven? bear
 mind, however, neptune still furious ulysses having
 blinded eye polyphemus king cyclopes. polyphemus to
 neptune nymph thoosa, daughter sea-king phorcys;
 therefore though will kill ulysses outright, torments by
 preventing getting home. still, let us lay heads together
 see can help return; neptune will pacified,
 mind can hardly stand us.”
 
minerva said, “father, saturn, king kings, if, then, the
 gods now mean ulysses get home, first send
 mercury ogygian island tell calypso made our
 minds return. meantime will go ithaca, to
 put heart ulysses’ telemachus; will embolden call the
 achaeans assembly, speak suitors mother
 penelope, persist eating number sheep oxen; i
 will also conduct sparta pylos, see can hear
 anything return dear father—for will make people
 speak well him.”
 
saying bound glittering golden sandals, imperishable,
 can fly like wind land sea; grasped the
 redoubtable bronze-shod spear, stout sturdy strong,
 wherewith quells ranks heroes displeased her, and
 darted topmost summits olympus, whereon forthwith
 ithaca, gateway ulysses’ house, disguised a
 visitor, mentes, chief taphians, held bronze spear in
 hand. found lordly suitors seated hides the
 oxen killed eaten, playing draughts front of
 house. men-servants pages bustling wait upon
 them, mixing wine water mixing-bowls, cleaning
 tables wet sponges laying again, some
 cutting great quantities meat.
 
telemachus saw long one else did. sitting moodily
 among suitors thinking brave father, would
 send flying house, come again
 honoured days gone by. thus brooding sat among them,
 caught sight minerva went straight gate, was
 vexed stranger kept waiting admittance. took
 right hand own, bade give spear. “welcome,”
 said he, “to house, partaken food shall

 drew clean table beside them. upper servant brought bread,
 offered many good things house, the
 carver fetched plates manner meats set cups gold

suitors came took places benches and
 seats.3 forthwith men servants poured water hands, maids
 went round bread-baskets, pages filled mixing-bowls with
 wine water, laid hands upon good things that
 them. soon enough eat drink they
 wanted music dancing, crowning embellishments a
 banquet, servant brought lyre phemius, compelled
 perforce sing them. soon touched lyre began to
 sing telemachus spoke low minerva, head close that
 man might hear.
 
“i hope, sir,” said he, “that will offended am

 done cost one whose bones lie rotting some
 wilderness grinding powder surf. men see

“my mother,” answered telemachus, “tells ulysses, it
 wise child knows father. one
 grown old upon estates, for, since ask me, is
 ill-starred man heaven tell my
 father.”
 
minerva said, “there fear race dying yet, while

 guests—how atrociously behaving; riot make

“sir,” said telemachus, “as regards question, long father

 long will also myself.”
 
“is so?” exclaimed minerva, “then indeed want ulysses home

“but there! rests heaven determine whether return,

 advice, call achaean heroes assembly to-morrow morning—lay your

 thence go sparta visit menelaus, got home last all
 achaeans; hear father alive way
 home, can put waste suitors will make yet
 another twelve months. hand hear death, come
 home once, celebrate funeral rites due pomp, build a
 barrow memory, make mother marry again. then, having
 done this, think well mind how, fair means or
 foul, may kill suitors house. old to
 plead infancy longer; heard people singing
 orestes’ praises killed father’s murderer aegisthus? you
 fine, smart looking fellow; show mettle, then, make
 name story. now, however, must go back ship and
 crew, will impatient keep waiting longer; think
 matter yourself, remember said you.”
 
“sir,” answered telemachus, “it kind talk me
 way, though son, will tell
 me; know want getting voyage, stay a
 little longer till taken bath refreshed yourself. will
 give present, shall go way rejoicing; will
 give one great beauty value—a keepsake dear
 friends give one another.”
 
minerva answered, “do try keep me, way at
 once. present may disposed make me, keep till i
 come again, will take home me. shall give very
 good one, will give one less value return.”
 
words flew away like bird air, had
 given telemachus courage, made think ever about
 father. felt change, wondered it, knew the
 stranger god, went straight suitors were
 sitting.
 
phemius still singing, hearers sat rapt silence he
 told sad tale return troy, ills minerva had
 laid upon achaeans. penelope, daughter icarius, heard song
 room upstairs, came great staircase, not
 alone, attended two handmaids. reached the
 suitors stood one bearing posts supported roof
 cloisters8 staid maiden either side her. held a
 veil, moreover, face, weeping bitterly.
 
“phemius,” cried, “you know many another feat gods heroes,
 poets love celebrate. sing suitors one these,
 let drink wine silence, cease sad tale, for
 breaks sorrowful heart, reminds lost husband i
 mourn ever without ceasing, whose name great hellas
 middle argos.”9
 
“mother,” answered telemachus, “let bard sing mind
 to; bards make ills sing of; jove, they, who
 makes them, sends weal woe upon mankind according own
 good pleasure. fellow means harm singing ill-fated
 return danaans, people always applaud latest songs most
 warmly. make mind bear it; ulysses only
 man never came back troy, many another went well
 he. go, then, within house busy daily
 duties, loom, distaff, ordering servants; for
 speech man’s matter, mine others 10—for am
 master here.”
 
went wondering back house, laid son’s saying in
 heart. then, going upstairs handmaids room, she
 mourned dear husband till minerva shed sweet sleep eyes.
 suitors clamorous throughout covered cloisters11, and
 prayed one might bed fellow.
 
telemachus spoke, “shameless,” cried, “and insolent suitors,
 let us feast pleasure now, let brawling, it
 rare thing hear man divine voice phemius has;
 morning meet full assembly may give formal
 notice depart, feast one another’s houses, turn turn
 about, cost. hand choose persist in
 spunging upon one man, heaven help me, jove shall reckon you
 full, fall father’s house shall man
 avenge you.”
 
suitors bit lips heard him, marvelled the
 boldness speech. then, antinous, eupeithes, said, “the
 gods seem given lessons bluster tall talking; may
 jove never grant chief ithaca father before
 you.”
 
telemachus answered, “antinous, chide me, but, god willing,
 will chief can. worst fate can think of
 me? bad thing chief, brings riches and
 honour. still, now ulysses dead many great men in
 ithaca old young, may take lead among them;
 nevertheless will chief house, will rule whom
 ulysses won me.”
 
eurymachus, polybus, answered, “it rests heaven to
 decide shall chief among us, shall master own
 house possessions; one man in
 ithaca shall violence rob you. now, good fellow, i
 want know stranger. country come from? of
 family he, estate? brought news
 return father, business own? he

“my father dead gone,” answered telemachus, “and even some
 rumour reaches put faith now. mother indeed
 sometimes send soothsayer question him, give his
 prophecyings heed. stranger, mentes, of
 anchialus, chief taphians, old friend father’s.” in
 heart knew goddess.
 
suitors returned singing dancing the
 evening; night fell upon pleasuring went home to
 bed abode.12 telemachus’s room high tower13
 looked outer court; hither, then, hied, brooding and
 full thought. good old woman, euryclea, daughter ops, son
 pisenor, went couple blazing torches. laertes
 bought money quite young; gave the
 worth twenty oxen her, shewed much respect his
 household wedded wife, take to
 bed feared wife’s resentment.14 now
 lighted telemachus room, loved better of

 baby. opened door bed room sat upon bed; as

 tidily up, hung peg bed side, which
 went out, pulled door silver catch, drew bolt

telemachus dashed staff ground burst into
 tears. every one sorry him, sat still no
 one ventured make angry answer, save antinous, spoke
 thus:
 
“telemachus, insolent braggart are, dare try throw

“this said, assented; whereon see her

telemachus answered, “antinous, can drive mother bore me

spoke jove sent two eagles top mountain, they
 flew wind, sailing side side lordly
 flight. right middle assembly they
 wheeled circled about, beating air wings glaring
 death eyes below; then, fighting fiercely
 tearing one another, flew towards right the
 town. people wondered saw them, asked what
 might be; whereon halitherses, best prophet and
 reader omens among them, spoke plainly honesty,
 saying:
 
“hear me, men ithaca, speak particularly suitors,
 see mischief brewing them. ulysses going away
 much longer; indeed close hand deal death and
 destruction, alone, many another us live in
 ithaca. let us wise time, put stop wickedness
 comes. let suitors accord; will be
 better them, prophesying without due knowledge;
 everything happened ulysses foretold argives set
 troy, them. said going much
 hardship losing men come home the
 twentieth year one know him; now is
 coming true.”
 
eurymachus polybus said, “go home, old man, prophesy to
 children, may worse them. can read omens
 much better can; birds always flying the
 sunshine somewhere other, seldom mean anything. ulysses has
 died far country, pity dead along with
 him, instead prating omens adding fuel anger
 telemachus fierce enough is. suppose think he
 will give something family, tell you—and shall
 surely be—when old man like you, know better, talks a
 young one till becomes troublesome, first place his
 young friend will fare much worse—he will take nothing by
 it, suitors will prevent this—and next, will lay a
 heavier fine, sir, upon will like paying, for
 will bear hardly upon you. telemachus, warn the

 continue eat telemachus’s estate without paying him, till
 time mother leaves tormenting us keeping us day
 day tiptoe expectation, vying in
 suit prize rare perfection. besides go
 women marry due course, the
 way treats us.”
 
telemachus said, “eurymachus, suitors, shall say
 more, entreat further, gods people of
 ithaca now know story. give me, then, ship crew twenty
 men take hither thither, will go sparta pylos
 quest father long missing. one may tell
 something, (and people often hear things way) some
 heaven-sent message may direct me. can hear alive on
 way home will put waste suitors will make yet
 another twelve months. hand hear death, will
 return once, celebrate funeral rites due pomp, build a
 barrow memory, make mother marry again.”
 
words sat down, mentor20 friend of
 ulysses, left charge everything full authority
 servants, rose speak. he, then, plainly honesty
 addressed thus:
 
“hear me, men ithaca, hope may never kind and
 well-disposed ruler more, one will govern equitably; i
 hope chiefs henceforward may cruel unjust, for
 one forgotten ulysses, ruled as
 though father. half angry suitors,
 choose violence naughtiness hearts,
 wager heads ulysses will return, can take the
 high hand eat estate, others shocked at
 way sit still without even trying stop such
 scandalous goings on—which chose, many

leiocritus, evenor, answered saying, “mentor, folly is
 this, set people stay us? hard thing
 one man fight many victuals. even though ulysses
 set upon us feasting house, do

 small cause rejoicing, blood upon own
 head fought great odds. sense what
 saying. now, therefore, people go your
 business, let father’s old friends, mentor halitherses,
 speed boy journey, goes all—which think
 will, likely stay till one comes
 tells something.”
 
broke assembly, every man went back own
 abode, suitors returned house ulysses.
 
telemachus went alone side, washed hands the
 grey waves, prayed minerva.
 
“hear me,” cried, “you god visited yesterday, bade me

 suitors, hindering so.”
 
thus prayed, minerva came close likeness and

thus spoke minerva daughter jove, telemachus lost time in
 goddess told him. went moodily home, found the
 suitors flaying goats singeing pigs outer court. antinous
 came laughed took hand own,
 saying, “telemachus, fine fire-eater, bear ill blood neither
 word deed, eat drink us used do. the
 achaeans will find everything—a ship picked crew to
 boot—so can set sail pylos get news your

“antinous,” answered telemachus, “i eat peace, take

spoke snatched hand antinous. meanwhile the
 others went getting dinner ready buildings,21 jeering at
 tauntingly so.
 
“telemachus,” said one youngster, “means death us; i
 suppose thinks can bring friends help pylos, again

 well, poison put wine kill us?”
 
another said, “perhaps telemachus goes board ship, will be
 like father perish far friends. case should
 plenty do, divide property amongst us:
 house can let mother man marries have
 that.”
 
talked. telemachus went lofty and
 spacious store-room father’s treasure gold bronze lay
 heaped upon floor, linen spare clothes were
 kept open chests. here, too, store fragrant olive
 oil, casks old, well-ripened wine, unblended fit god
 drink, ranged wall case ulysses come home

 middle; moreover faithful old house-keeper euryclea, daughter
 ops pisenor, charge everything night and
 day. telemachus called store-room said:
 
“nurse, draw best wine have, are
 keeping father’s drinking, case, poor man, should
 escape death, find way home all. let twelve
 jars, see lids; also fill well-sewn
 leathern bags barley meal—about twenty measures all. get these
 things put together once, say nothing it. will take
 everything away evening soon mother gone upstairs for
 night. going sparta pylos see can hear
 anything return dear father.”
 
euryclea heard began cry, spoke fondly him,
 saying, “my dear child, ever can put notion into
 head? world want go to—you, one
 hope house? poor father dead gone foreign
 country nobody knows where, soon back turned these
 wicked ones will scheming get put way, and
 will share possessions among themselves; stay are

“fear not, nurse,” answered telemachus, “my scheme without
 heaven’s sanction; swear will say nothing this
 mother, till away ten twelve days, unless she
 hears gone, asks you; want spoil

old woman swore solemnly not, had
 completed oath, began drawing wine jars, and
 getting barley meal bags, telemachus went back to
 suitors.
 
minerva bethought another matter. took shape, and
 went round town one crew, telling meet at
 ship sundown. went also noemon phronius, asked
 let ship—which ready do. sun

 water, put tackle board ships generally carry, and
 stationed end harbour. presently crew came up,
 goddess spoke encouragingly them.
 
furthermore went house ulysses, threw suitors
 deep slumber. caused drink fuddle them, made
 drop cups hands, instead sitting over
 wine, went back town sleep, eyes

“telemachus,” said she, “the men board oars,
 waiting give orders, make haste let us off.”
 
led way, telemachus followed steps. when
 got ship found crew waiting water side, and
 telemachus said, “now men, help get stores board; they
 put together cloister, mother know

words led way others followed after. when
 brought things told them, telemachus went board,
 minerva going taking seat stern the

 telemachus told catch hold ropes hoist sail, and
 told them. set mast socket cross

 hoisted white sails aloft ropes twisted ox hide. the
 sail bellied wind, ship flew deep blue

 telemachus crew arrived, furled sails, brought ship

minerva led way telemachus followed her. presently said,
 “telemachus, must least shy nervous; have
 taken voyage try find father buried and
 came end; go straight nestor may see
 got tell us. beg speak truth, will
 tell lies, excellent person.”
 
“but how, mentor,” replied telemachus, “dare go nestor, how
 address him? never yet used holding long
 conversations people, ashamed begin questioning one who
 much older myself.”
 
“some things, telemachus,” answered minerva, “will suggested you
 instinct, heaven will prompt further; am
 assured gods time birth

went quickly on, telemachus followed steps till
 reached place guilds pylian people were
 assembled. found nestor sitting sons, his
 company round busy getting dinner ready, putting pieces of

 strangers crowded round them, took hand bade
 take places. nestor’s pisistratus offered his
 hand them, seated soft sheepskins were
 lying sands near father brother thrasymedes. he
 gave portions inward meats poured wine them

“offer prayer, sir,” said he, “to king neptune, feast

spoke handed cup. minerva thought right and
 proper given first;27 accordingly
 began praying heartily neptune. “o thou,” cried, “that
 encirclest earth, vouchsafe grant prayers thy servants
 call upon thee. especially pray thee send thy grace
 nestor sons; thereafter also make rest pylian
 people handsome return goodly hecatomb offering
 you. lastly, grant telemachus happy issue, respect of

thus made end praying, handed cup to

telemachus answered boldly, minerva given courage ask

“my friend,” answered nestor, “you recall time much sorrow my

servants washed anointed oil, they

menelaus overheard said, “no one, sons, can hold own

thus spoke menelaus, heart telemachus yearned he
 bethought father. tears fell eyes heard him
 thus mentioned, held cloak face both
 hands. menelaus saw doubted whether let choose his
 time speaking, ask find all

thus two minds helen came high vaulted
 perfumed room, looking lovely diana herself. adraste brought
 seat, alcippe soft woollen rug phylo fetched the
 silver work-box alcandra wife polybus given her. polybus
 lived egyptian thebes, richest city whole world;
 gave menelaus two baths, pure silver, two tripods, ten
 talents gold; besides this, wife gave helen beautiful
 presents, wit, golden distaff, silver work box ran on
 wheels, gold band round top it. phylo now placed by
 side, full fine spun yarn, distaff charged violet
 coloured wool laid upon top it. helen took seat,
 put feet upon footstool, began question husband.42
 
“do know, menelaus,” said she, “the names strangers who
 come visit us? shall guess right wrong?—but help
 saying think. never yet seen either man woman like
 somebody else (indeed look hardly know think)
 young man like telemachus, ulysses left baby

“my dear wife,” replied menelaus, “i see likeness just do.

 talking ulysses, saying much suffered my

pisistratus said, “menelaus, atreus, right in
 thinking young man telemachus, modest, and
 ashamed come begin opening discourse one whose
 conversation divinely interesting own. father, nestor,
 sent escort hither, wanted know whether could
 give counsel suggestion. always trouble home

 fortune, prevented poor fellow ever getting home at
 all.”
 
thus speak, words set weeping. helen wept,
 telemachus wept, menelaus, pisistratus keep his
 eyes filling, remembered dear brother antilochus whom
 bright dawn killed. thereon said menelaus,
 
“sir, father nestor, used talk home, told me

 said:

“how sad,” exclaimed telemachus, “that avail save

helen told maid servants set beds room was

 coverlets top woollen cloaks guests to

 telemachus pisistratus sleep forecourt, son
 atreus lay inner room lovely helen side.
 
child morning, rosy-fingered dawn appeared, menelaus rose
 dressed himself. bound sandals comely feet, girded
 sword shoulders, left room looking like an
 immortal god. then, taking seat near telemachus said:
 
“and what, telemachus, led take long voyage to
 lacedaemon? public, private business? tell about

“i come, sir,” replied telemachus, “to see can tell me

meanwhile suitors throwing discs aiming spears a
 mark levelled ground front ulysses’ house, were
 behaving old insolence. antinous eurymachus, who
 ringleaders much foremost among all, were
 sitting together noemon phronius came said to
 antinous,
 
“have idea, antinous, day telemachus returns pylos?
 ship mine, want it, cross elis: have
 twelve brood mares yearling mule foals side yet

astounded heard this, made sure that
 telemachus gone city neleus. thought only

 swineherd; antinous said, “when go? tell truly, what
 young men take him? freemen own
 bondsmen—for might manage too? tell also, let him

“i lent him,” answered noemon, “what else man of

noemon went back father’s house, antinous and
 eurymachus angry. told others leave playing,

 antinous eupeithes spoke anger. heart black with
 rage, eyes flashed fire said:
 
“good heavens, voyage telemachus serious matter; we

thus speak, others applauded saying; all
 went inside buildings.
 
long ere penelope came know suitors were
 plotting; man servant, medon, overheard outside the
 outer court laying schemes within, went tell
 mistress. crossed threshold room penelope said:
 “medon, suitors sent for? tell the
 maids leave master’s business cook dinner them? wish
 may neither woo dine henceforward, neither anywhere

 good ulysses them—never anything high-handed, nor
 speaking harshly anybody? kings may say things sometimes, they
 may take fancy one man dislike another, ulysses never did
 unjust thing anybody—which shows bad hearts have, and
 thing gratitude left world.”
 
medon said, “i wish, madam, all; are
 plotting something much dreadful now—may heaven frustrate their
 design. going try murder telemachus coming

penelope’s heart sank within her, long time was
 speechless; eyes filled tears, find no
 utterance. last, however, said, “why leave me? what

 ocean like sea-horses? want die without leaving one

“i know,” answered medon, “whether god set it, or

went downstairs again, leaving penelope agony grief.

words made mistress leave crying, dried the

 went upstairs maids. put bruised barley a

“hear me,” cried, “daughter aegis-bearing jove, unweariable. if

 sails inside her; bound oars thole-pins twisted
 thongs leather, due course, spread white sails aloft,
 fine servants brought armour. made the
 ship fast little way out, came shore again, got suppers, and
 waited till night fall.
 
penelope lay room upstairs unable eat drink, and
 wondering whether brave escape, overpowered the
 wicked suitors. like lioness caught toils huntsmen
 hemming every side thought thought till sank into
 slumber, lay bed bereft thought motion.
 
minerva bethought another matter, made vision the

“then,” said penelope, “if god sent by

 still alive, already dead house hades?”
 
vision said, “i shall tell certain whether is

vanished thong-hole door dissipated
 thin air; penelope rose sleep refreshed and
 comforted, vivid dream.
 
meantime suitors went board sailed ways sea,

“then send away,” said mercury, “or jove will angry and

 got tired calypso, though forced sleep with

“my poor fellow, shall stay grieving fretting your

ulysses shuddered heard her. “now goddess,” answered, “there
 something behind this; really meaning help me

 even well found ship fair wind venture a

calypso smiled caressed hand: “you know a

thus spoken led way rapidly him, and
 ulysses followed steps; pair, goddess man, went on
 till came calypso’s cave, ulysses took seat
 mercury just left. calypso set meat drink of
 food mortals eat; maids brought ambrosia nectar
 herself, laid hands good things were

 calypso spoke, saying:
 
“ulysses, noble laertes, start home own

thereon gathered clouds together, grasped trident, stirred
 round sea, roused rage every wind blows till
 earth, sea, sky hidden cloud, night sprang forth of

plight, ino daughter cadmus, also called
 leucothea, saw him. formerly mere mortal, been
 since raised rank marine goddess. seeing great
 distress ulysses now was, compassion upon him, and, rising like
 sea-gull waves, took seat upon raft.
 
“my poor good man,” said she, “why neptune furiously angry with
 you? giving great deal trouble, bluster
 will kill you. seem sensible person, i
 bid you; strip, leave raft drive wind, swim to
 phaeacian coast better luck awaits you. here, take my

 words took veil gave him. dived

ulysses know think. “alas,” said in
 dismay, “this one gods luring

 present, land said quit all

 sure will best—no matter happens will stick raft as

thus two minds, neptune sent terrible great wave that
 seemed rear head till broke right raft,
 went pieces though heap dry chaff tossed
 whirlwind. ulysses got astride one plank rode upon it
 horseback; took clothes calypso had
 given him, bound ino’s veil arms, plunged the

 wagged head, muttering saying, “there now, swim

minerva resolved help ulysses, bound ways the
 winds except one, made lie quite still; roused good
 stiff breeze north lay waters till ulysses
 reached land phaeacians safe.
 
thereon floated two nights two days water, with
 heavy swell death staring face; when
 third day broke, wind fell dead calm without so
 much breath air stirring. rose swell looked
 eagerly ahead, see land quite near. then, children rejoice

 began hear surf thundering rocks, swell
 still broke terrific roar. everything enveloped
 spray; harbours ship might ride, shelter

ulysses’ heart now began fail him, said despairingly to
 himself, “alas, jove let see land swimming far i

thus two minds wave caught took such

god staid stream stilled waves, making calm

 last ulysses’ knees strong hands failed him, had
 completely broken him. body swollen, mouth and
 nostrils ran like river sea-water, neither

 got breath came again, took the

“alas,” cried dismay, “what ever will become of

thus, then, ulysses wait pray; girl drove the

 brought supper room.
 
presently ulysses got go towards town; minerva shed a
 thick mist round hide case proud
 phaeacians met rude him, ask was.
 then, just entering town, came towards the
 likeness little girl carrying pitcher. stood right front
 him, ulysses said:
 
“my dear, will kind show house king alcinous?
 unfortunate foreigner distress, know one your

minerva said, “yes, father stranger, will show house you

minerva left scheria went away sea. went to

 pondered much paused reaching threshold of

“queen arete,” exclaimed, “daughter great rhexenor, my

 addressed thus:
 
“alcinous,” said he, “it creditable stranger

 alcinous said one servants, “pontonous, mix cup of
 wine hand round may make drink-offerings jove the
 lord thunder, protector well-disposed suppliants.”
 
pontonous mixed wine water, handed round giving

 help ulysses get home. went citizens, man man, and
 said, “aldermen town councillors phaeacians, come the
 assembly listen stranger just come a
 long voyage house king alcinous; looks like immortal
 god.”
 
words made want come, flocked to
 assembly till seats standing room alike crowded. every one
 struck appearance ulysses, minerva beautified
 head shoulders, making look taller stouter

 remarkable man, might come well many trials

 together, alcinous spoke:
 
“hear me,” said he, “aldermen town councillors phaeacians,

alcinous led way, others followed after, a
 servant went fetch demodocus. fifty-two picked oarsmen went to

 alcinous killed dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, two
 oxen. skinned dressed provide magnificent
 banquet.
 
servant presently led famous bard demodocus, muse had
 dearly loved, given good evil, though
 endowed divine gift song, robbed of

thus sang bard, ulysses drew purple mantle head

 weeping. bard left singing wiped tears from
 eyes, uncovered face, and, taking cup, made a
 drink-offering gods; phaeacians pressed demodocus
 sing further, delighted lays, ulysses again
 drew mantle head wept bitterly. one noticed his
 distress except alcinous, sitting near him, heard heavy
 sighs heaving. said, “aldermen town
 councillors phaeacians, enough now, the
 feast, minstrelsy due accompaniment; let us
 proceed therefore athletic sports, guest his

words led way, others followed after. a
 servant hung demodocus’s lyre peg him, led the

 thousands people followed them, many excellent
 competitors prizes. acroneos, ocyalus, elatreus, nauteus,

 amphialus polyneus tecton. also euryalus

 amphialus excelled others jumping, throwing the

 diverted games, “let us ask stranger

“you quite right, laodamas,” replied euryalus, “go guest

euryalus reviled outright said, “i gather, then, you

“for shame, sir,” answered ulysses, fiercely, “you insolent

 made ground smooth marked wide space dancers.
 presently servant came back demodocus’s lyre, took his
 place midst them, whereon best young dancers town
 began foot trip nimbly ulysses delighted the
 merry twinkling feet.
 
meanwhile bard began sing loves mars venus, how
 first began intrigue house vulcan. mars made venus
 many presents, defiled king vulcan’s marriage bed, sun, who

nothing loth, went couch take rest,

gods gathered house vulcan. earth-encircling
 neptune came, mercury bringer luck, king apollo, the
 goddesses staid home shame. givers all
 good things stood doorway, blessed gods roared with
 inextinguishable laughter, saw cunning vulcan been,
 whereon one turn towards neighbour saying:
 
“ill deeds prosper, weak confound strong. see how
 limping vulcan, lame is, caught mars fleetest god
 heaven; now mars will cast heavy damages.”
 
thus converse, king apollo said mercury, “messenger
 mercury, giver good things, care strong chains
 were, you, sleep venus?”
 
“king apollo,” answered mercury, “i wish might get chance,
 though three times many chains—and might look on, all
 you, gods goddesses, sleep could.”
 
immortal gods burst laughing heard him, neptune
 took seriously, kept imploring vulcan set mars free
 again. “let go,” cried, “and will undertake, require,

 immortal gods.”
 
“do not,” replied vulcan, “ask this; bad man’s bond bad

“vulcan,” said neptune, “if mars goes away without paying damages,

thus sang bard, ulysses seafaring phaeacians were
 charmed heard him.
 
alcinous told laodamas halius dance alone, no
 one compete them. took red ball polybus had
 made them, one bent backwards threw up
 towards clouds, jumped ground and
 caught ease came again. done
 throwing ball straight air began dance, at
 time kept throwing backwards forwards one

 stamping feet. ulysses said:
 
“king alcinous, said people nimblest dancers the
 world, indeed proved so. was
 astonished saw them.”
 
king delighted this, exclaimed phaeacians,
 “aldermen town councillors, guest seems person of
 singular judgement; let us give proof hospitality he
 may reasonably expect. twelve chief men among you, and
 counting thirteen; contribute, you, clean
 cloak, shirt, talent fine gold; let us give in

thus speak. others applauded saying, and
 sent servants fetch presents. euryalus said, “king

spoke placed sword hands ulysses said, “good

ulysses answered, “good luck friend, may the
 gods grant every happiness. hope will miss sword you

words girded sword shoulders towards
 sundown presents began make appearance, servants of
 donors kept bringing house king alcinous; his
 sons received them, placed mother’s charge. then
 alcinous led way house bade guests take seats.
 
“wife,” said he, turning queen arete, “go, fetch best chest we

ulysses said, “nausicaa, daughter great alcinous, may jove the

said this, seated beside alcinous. supper was

servant carried pork fingers demodocus, took

answered, swineherd eumaeus, “poor unhappy stranger, i

ulysses answered, “i see unbelieving mind; have

thus converse, presently swineherds came the

 he, “eumaeus rest you; said prayer will tell

meanwhile ulysses swineherd lit fire hut were

 fawned upon him, ulysses, hearing sound feet noticing
 dogs bark, said eumaeus:
 
“eumaeus, hear footsteps; suppose one men one of

 barking.”
 
words hardly mouth stood the
 door. eumaeus sprang feet, bowls mixing

“so come, telemachus, light eyes are. i

“so it, old friend,” answered telemachus, “but come now because
 want see you, learn whether mother still old
 home whether one else married her, bed of
 ulysses without bedding covered cobwebs.”
 
“she still house,” replied eumaeus, “grieving breaking
 heart, nothing weep, night day continually.”
 
spoke took telemachus’ spear, whereon crossed stone
 threshold came inside. ulysses rose seat give place
 entered, telemachus checked him; “sit down, stranger,” said
 he, “i can easily find another seat, one will lay

ulysses went back place, eumaeus strewed green
 brushwood floor threw sheepskin top for

 cold meat, remains eaten day before, he
 filled bread baskets bread fast could. mixed wine
 also bowls ivy-wood, took seat facing ulysses. they
 laid hands good things them, soon

 “old friend, stranger come from? crew bring

answered, swineherd eumaeus, “my son, will tell the

“i much distressed,” said telemachus, “by just

“i understand heed you,” replied eumaeus; “you need instruct no

thus urge swineherd; eumaeus, therefore, took sandals,

“ulysses, noble laertes, now time tell your

ulysses said, “i god, take one? am

“you father, god flattering vain hopes

 half fledged young peasants. thus piteously weep, the
 sun gone upon mourning telemachus not
 suddenly said, “in ship, dear father, crew bring you

“i will tell truth, son,” replied ulysses. “it the

telemachus answered, “father, always heard your

 great one: awed mere thought it; two men cannot
 stand many brave ones. ten suitors only, nor
 twice ten, ten many times over; shall learn number at

“listen me,” replied ulysses, “and think whether minerva her

“those named,” answered telemachus, “are couple good
 allies, though dwell high among clouds power

“these two,” continued ulysses, “will keep long fray,

 home early to-morrow morning, go among suitors before.

 outbuildings went back pigs again.
 
suitors surprised angry happened, went
 outside great wall ran round outer court, held a
 council near main entrance. eurymachus, polybus, the
 first speak.
 
“my friends,” said he, “this voyage telemachus’s serious
 matter; made sure come nothing. now, however,
 let us draw ship water, get crew together send
 others tell come back fast can.”
 
hardly done speaking amphinomus turned place saw
 ship inside harbour, crew lowering sails, and
 putting oars; laughed, said others, “we need
 send message, here. god must told
 them, else saw ship go by, overtake her.”
 
rose went water side. crew drew the
 ship shore; servants took armour them, they
 went body place assembly, let any
 one old young sit along them, antinous, eupeithes,

“good heavens,” said he, “see gods saved man from

held peace amphinomus rose speak. the

 honestly, “i favour killing telemachus. heinous
 thing kill one noble blood. let us first take counsel of
 gods, oracles jove advise it, will help to
 kill myself, will urge everyone else so; they
 dissuade us, hold hands.”
 
thus speak, words pleased well, rose
 forthwith went house ulysses, took their
 accustomed seats.
 
penelope resolved show suitors. she
 knew plot telemachus, servant medon had
 overheard counsels told her; went therefore to
 court attended maidens, reached suitors she
 stood one bearing-posts supporting roof cloister
 holding veil face, rebuked antinous saying:
 
“antinous, insolent wicked schemer, say best
 speaker counsellor man age ithaca, are
 nothing kind. madman, try compass death of
 telemachus, take heed suppliants, whose witness jove
 himself? right plot thus one another. do
 remember father fled house fear the
 people, enraged gone taphian
 pirates plundered thesprotians peace us? they
 wanted tear pieces eat everything had, ulysses
 stayed hands although infuriated, now devour
 property without paying it, break heart wooing his
 wife trying kill son. leave so, stop the
 others also.”
 
eurymachus polybus answered, “take heart, queen penelope
 daughter icarius, trouble matters.
 man yet born, never will be, shall lay hands upon
 telemachus, yet live look upon face the
 earth. say—and shall surely be—that spear shall reddened
 blood; many time ulysses taken knees, held
 wine lips drink, put pieces meat hands.
 therefore telemachus much dearest friend have, nothing
 fear hands us suitors. course, death comes him
 gods, escape it.” said quiet her, in
 reality plotting telemachus.
 
penelope went upstairs mourned husband till minerva
 shed sleep eyes. evening eumaeus got back ulysses
 son, just sacrificed young pig year old were
 helping one another get supper ready; minerva therefore came to
 ulysses, turned old man stroke wand, clad
 old clothes again, fear swineherd might
 recognise keep secret, go tell penelope.
 
telemachus first speak. “so got back, eumaeus,”
 said he. “what news town? suitors returned, or
 still waiting yonder, take way home?”
 
“i think asking that,” replied eumaeus, “when in
 town. thought give message come back soon i

telemachus mother meet—ulysses eumaeus come the
 town, ulysses insulted melanthius—he recognised dog
 argos—he insulted presently struck antinous a
 stool—penelope desires shall sent her.
 

child morning, rosy-fingered dawn, appeared, telemachus
 bound sandals took strong spear suited hands, for
 wanted go city. “old friend,” said swineherd,
 “i will now go town show mother, will
 never leave grieving till seen me. unfortunate
 stranger, take town let beg one who
 will give drink piece bread. trouble enough my
 own, burdened people. makes angry
 much worse him, like say mean.”
 
ulysses said, “sir, want stay here; beggar can

 something. old care remaining beck
 call master. therefore let man just told
 him, take town soon warm fire,
 day got little heat it. clothes wretchedly
 thin, frosty morning shall perished cold, you
 say city way off.”
 
telemachus strode yards, brooding revenge
 upon suitors. reached home stood spear a
 bearing-post cloister, crossed stone floor cloister
 itself, went inside.
 
nurse euryclea saw long one else did. putting
 fleeces seats, burst crying ran to
 him; maids came too, covered head and
 shoulders kisses. penelope came room looking like
 diana venus, wept flung arms son. she
 kissed forehead beautiful eyes, “light eyes,”
 cried spoke fondly him, “so come home again; i
 made sure never going see more. think your
 gone pylos without saying anything obtaining
 consent. come, tell saw.”
 
“do scold me, mother,” answered telemachus, “nor vex me, seeing
 narrow escape had, wash face, change dress,
 go upstairs maids, promise full sufficient hecatombs
 gods jove will grant us revenge upon the
 suitors. must now go place assembly invite stranger
 come back pylos. sent crew, and
 told piraeus take home look till come for
 myself.”
 
heeded son’s words, washed face, changed dress, and
 vowed full sufficient hecatombs gods only
 vouchsafe revenge upon suitors.
 
telemachus went through, of, cloisters spear hand—not
 alone, two fleet dogs went him. minerva endowed a
 presence divine comeliness marvelled went
 by, suitors gathered round fair words mouths
 malice hearts; avoided them, went sit with
 mentor, antiphus, halitherses, old friends father’s house,
 made tell happened him. piraeus
 came theoclymenus, escorted town the
 place assembly, whereon telemachus joined them. piraeus was
 first speak: “telemachus,” said he, “i wish send of
 women house take away presents menelaus gave you.”
 
“we know, piraeus,” answered telemachus, “what may happen. if
 suitors kill house divide property among them,
 rather presents people
 get hold them. hand managed kill them, i
 shall much obliged will kindly bring presents.”
 
words took theoclymenus house. got
 laid cloaks benches seats, went the
 baths, washed themselves. maids washed anointed
 them, given cloaks shirts, took seats at
 table. maid servant brought water beautiful golden
 ewer, poured silver basin wash hands;
 drew clean table beside them. upper servant brought them
 bread offered many good things house.
 opposite sat penelope, reclining couch one the
 bearing-posts cloister, spinning. laid hands
 good things them, soon had
 enough eat drink penelope said:
 
“telemachus, shall go upstairs lie sad couch, which
 ceased water tears, day ulysses set out
 troy sons atreus. failed, however, make clear
 suitors came back house, whether had
 able hear anything return father.”
 
“i will tell truth,” replied son. “we went pylos and
 saw nestor, took house treated hospitably as
 though just returned long
 absence; also sons; said heard word from
 human ulysses, whether alive dead. sent
 me, therefore, chariot horses menelaus. saw
 helen, whose sake many, argives trojans, in
 heaven’s wisdom doomed suffer. menelaus asked that

 said, ‘so, then, cowards usurp brave man’s bed? hind

 menelaus told me, heard story came away;
 gods gave fair wind soon brought safe home again.”
 
words moved heart penelope. theoclymenus said
 her:
 
“madam, wife ulysses, telemachus understand things;
 listen therefore me, can divine surely, will hide
 nothing you. may jove king heaven witness, the
 rites hospitality, hearth ulysses now come,
 ulysses even now ithaca, and, either going the
 country staying one place, enquiring evil deeds
 preparing day reckoning suitors. saw omen i
 ship meant this, told telemachus it.”
 
“may even so,” answered penelope; “if words come true, you
 shall gifts good will see you
 shall congratulate you.”
 
thus converse. meanwhile suitors throwing discs, or
 aiming spears mark levelled ground front the
 house, behaving old insolence. now
 time dinner, flock sheep goats come the
 town country round, 140 shepherds usual,
 medon, favourite servant, waited upon them

 come inside may get dinner ready. dinner bad thing,
 dinner time.”
 
left sports told them, within the
 house, laid cloaks benches seats inside, then
 sacrificed sheep, goats, pigs, heifer, fat and
 well grown.141 thus made ready meal. meantime
 ulysses swineherd starting town, the
 swineherd said, “stranger, suppose still want go town

 tells me, will scold later on, scolding one’s
 master serious thing. let us off, now broad
 day; will night directly will find it
 colder.”142
 
“i know, understand you,” replied ulysses; “you need say more.
 let us going, stick ready cut, let to
 walk with, say road rough one.”
 
spoke threw shabby old tattered wallet shoulders,
 cord hung, eumaeus gave stick his
 liking. two started, leaving station charge dogs
 herdsmen remained behind; swineherd led way his
 master followed after, looking like broken old tramp he
 leaned upon staff, clothes rags. had
 got rough steep ground nearing city, reached

 ulysses reviled outrageous unseemly language, which
 made ulysses angry.
 
“there go,” cried he, “and precious pair are. see heaven

this, passed, gave ulysses kick hip pure

 moment doubted whether fly melanthius kill him
 staff, fling ground beat brains out; he
 resolved, however, endure keep check, the
 swineherd looked straight melanthius rebuked him, lifting his
 hands praying heaven so.
 
“fountain nymphs,” cried, “children jove, ever ulysses burned
 thigh bones covered fat whether lambs kids, grant my
 prayer heaven may send home. soon put end the
 swaggering threats men go insulting
 people—gadding town flocks going ruin
 bad shepherding.”
 
melanthius goatherd answered, “you ill conditioned cur, what
 talking about? day will put board ship

 money will fetch. wish sure apollo strike
 telemachus dead day, suitors kill him, i
 ulysses will never come home again.”
 
left come leisure, went
 quickly forward soon reached house master. got
 went took seat among suitors opposite
 eurymachus, liked better others. servants
 brought portion meat, upper woman servant set bread
 might eat. presently ulysses swineherd came
 house stood it, amid sound music, phemius was
 just beginning sing suitors. ulysses took hold the
 swineherd’s hand, said:
 
“eumaeus, house ulysses fine place. matter far
 go, will find like it. one building keeps following on
 another. outer court wall battlements round
 it; doors double folding, good workmanship; be
 hard matter take force arms. perceive, too, there
 many people banqueting within it, smell roast
 meat, hear sound music, gods made go along
 feasting.”
 
eumaeus said, “you perceived aright, indeed generally
 do; let us think will best course. will go inside
 first join suitors, leaving behind you, will you
 wait let go first? wait long, one may
 see loitering outside, throw something you. consider
 matter pray you.”
 
ulysses answered, “i understand heed. go first leave me
 am. quite used beaten things
 thrown me. much buffeted war that
 case-hardened, may go rest. man cannot
 hide away cravings hungry belly; enemy gives
 much trouble men; ships fitted
 sail seas, make war upon people.”
 
thus talking, dog lying asleep raised his
 head pricked ears. argos, ulysses bred
 setting troy, never work him.
 old days used taken young men went
 hunting wild goats, deer, hares, now master gone
 lying neglected heaps mule cow dung lay in
 front stable doors till men come draw away to
 manure great close; full fleas. soon saw
 ulysses standing there, dropped ears wagged tail, he
 get close master. ulysses saw dog the
 side yard, dashed tear eyes without eumaeus
 seeing it, said:
 
“eumaeus, noble hound yonder manure heap:
 build splendid; fine fellow looks, he
 one dogs come begging table, kept
 merely show?”
 
“this hound,” answered eumaeus, “belonged died far
 country. ulysses left troy, would
 soon show do. wild beast the
 forest get away tracks. but
 now fallen evil times, master dead gone, and
 women take care him. servants never work their
 master’s hand longer them, jove takes half goodness
 man makes slave him.”
 
spoke went inside buildings cloister the
 suitors were, argos died soon recognised master.
 
telemachus saw eumaeus long one else did, beckoned him
 come sit beside him; looked saw seat lying
 near carver sat serving portions suitors; he
 picked up, brought telemachus’s table, sat opposite
 him. servant brought portion, gave bread from
 bread-basket.
 
immediately afterwards ulysses came inside, looking like poor
 miserable old beggar, leaning staff clothes in
 rags. sat upon threshold ash-wood just inside doors
 leading outer inner court, bearing-post
 cypress-wood carpenter skilfully planed, made
 join truly rule line. telemachus took whole loaf the
 bread-basket, much meat hold two hands, and
 said eumaeus, “take stranger, tell go the
 round suitors, beg them; beggar must be
 shamefaced.”
 
eumaeus went said, “stranger, telemachus sends you
 this, says go round suitors begging, for
 beggars must shamefaced.”
 
ulysses answered, “may king jove grant happiness telemachus, and
 fulfil desire heart.”
 
hands took telemachus sent him, laid it
 dirty old wallet feet. went eating the
 bard singing, just finished dinner left off. the
 suitors applauded bard, whereon minerva went ulysses and
 prompted beg pieces bread one suitors, that
 might see kind people were, tell good the
 bad; come might going save single one of
 them. ulysses, therefore, went round, going left right,
 stretched hands beg though real beggar.
 pitied him, curious him, asking one another
 came from; whereon goatherd melanthius
 said, “suitors noble mistress, can tell something about
 him, seen before. swineherd brought here, i
 know nothing man himself, comes from.”
 
antinous began abuse swineherd. “you precious idiot,” he
 cried, “what brought man town for? tramps
 beggars enough already pester us sit meat? think
 small thing people gather waste master’s
 property—and must needs bring man well?”
 
eumaeus answered, “antinous, birth good words
 evil. mine came here. likely to
 invite stranger foreign country, unless one who
 can public service seer, healer hurts, carpenter, a
 bard can charm us singing? men welcome the
 world over, one likely ask beggar will worry
 him. always harder ulysses’ servants other
 suitors are, me, care long as
 telemachus penelope alive here.”
 
telemachus said, “hush, answer him; antinous the
 bitterest tongue suitors, makes others worse.”
 
turning antinous said, “antinous, take much care of
 interests though son. want see this
 stranger turned house? heaven forbid; take something and
 give yourself; grudge it; bid take it. never mind
 mother, servants house; know you
 will say, fond eating things yourself
 giving people.”
 
“what mean, telemachus,” replied antinous, “by swaggering
 talk? suitors give much will, would
 come another three months.”
 
spoke drew stool rested dainty feet from
 table, made though throw ulysses, but
 suitors gave something, filled wallet with
 bread meat; about, therefore, go back threshold
 eat suitors given him, first went to
 antinous said:
 
“sir, give something; not, surely, poorest man here; you
 seem chief, foremost among all; therefore be
 better giver, will tell far wide bounty. too
 rich man once, fine house own; days i
 gave many tramp now am, matter might nor
 wanted. number servants, things
 people live well accounted wealthy, it
 pleased jove take away me. sent band roving
 robbers egypt; long voyage undone it. i
 stationed ships river aegyptus, bade men stay them
 keep guard them, sent scouts reconnoitre from
 every point vantage.
 
“but men disobeyed orders, took devices, and
 ravaged land egyptians, killing men, taking their
 wives children captives. alarm soon carried city,
 heard war-cry, people came daybreak till
 plain filled soldiers horse foot, gleam
 armour. jove spread panic among men, no
 longer face enemy, found surrounded. the
 egyptians killed many us, took rest alive forced
 labour them; myself, gave friend met them,
 take cyprus, dmetor name, iasus, great man in
 cyprus. thence come hither state great misery.”
 
antinous said, “what god can sent pestilence plague
 us dinner? get out, open part court,145 i
 will give egypt cyprus insolence and
 importunity; begged others, given you
 lavishly, abundance round them, easy free
 people’s property plenty it.”
 
ulysses began move off, said, “your looks, fine sir,
 better breeding; house would
 spare poor man much pinch salt, though in
 another man’s, surrounded abundance, find you
 give even piece bread.”
 
made antinous angry, scowled saying, “you shall
 pay get clear court.” words he
 threw footstool him, hit right shoulder blade near
 top back. ulysses stood firm rock blow not
 even stagger him, shook head silence brooded his
 revenge. went back threshold sat there, laying
 well filled wallet feet.
 
“listen me,” cried, “you suitors queen penelope, may
 speak even minded. man knows neither ache pain gets
 hit fighting money, sheep cattle; and
 even antinous hit service miserable belly,
 always getting people trouble. still, poor have
 gods avenging deities all, pray antinous may come to
 bad end marriage.”
 
“sit are, eat victuals silence, off
 elsewhere,” shouted antinous. “if say will dragged
 hand foot courts, servants shall flay you
 alive.”
 
suitors much displeased this, one young
 men said, “antinous, ill striking poor wretch a
 tramp: will worse turn some
 god—and know gods go disguised sorts ways as
 people foreign countries, travel world see do
 amiss righteously.”146
 
thus said suitors, antinous paid heed. meanwhile
 telemachus furious blow given his
 father, though tear fell him, shook head silence
 brooded revenge.
 
now penelope heard beggar struck the
 banqueting-cloister, said maids, “would apollo
 strike you, antinous,” waiting woman eurynome
 answered, “if prayers answered one suitors would
 ever see sun rise.” penelope said, “nurse,147 hate
 every single one them, mean nothing mischief, i
 hate antinous like darkness death itself. poor unfortunate
 tramp come begging house sheer want. every one else
 given something put wallet, antinous hit him
 right shoulder-blade footstool.”
 
thus talk maids sat room, the
 meantime ulysses getting dinner. called the
 swineherd said, “eumaeus, go tell stranger come here, i
 want see ask questions. seems travelled
 much, may seen heard something unhappy husband.”
 
answered, swineherd eumaeus, “if achaeans, madam,
 keep quiet, charmed history his
 adventures. three days three nights hut,
 first place reached running away ship,
 yet completed story misfortunes. had
 heaven-taught minstrel whole world, whose lips
 hearers hang entranced, charmed sat
 hut listened him. says old friendship
 house ulysses, comes crete
 descendants minos live, driven hither
 thither every kind misfortune; also declares has
 heard ulysses alive near hand among the
 thesprotians, bringing great wealth home him.”
 
“call here, then,” said penelope, “that may hear story.
 suitors, let take pleasure indoors they
 will, nothing fret about. corn wine remain
 unwasted houses none servants consume them, while
 keep hanging house day day sacrificing oxen,
 sheep, fat goats banquets, never giving much a
 thought quantity wine drink. estate can stand such
 recklessness, now ulysses protect us. to
 come again, soon revenge.”
 
spoke telemachus sneezed loudly whole house
 resounded it. penelope laughed heard this, said to
 eumaeus, “go call stranger; hear sneezed
 just speaking? can mean suitors are
 going killed, one shall escape. furthermore
 say, lay saying heart: satisfied the
 stranger speaking truth shall give shirt cloak of
 good wear.”
 
eumaeus heard went straight ulysses said, “father
 stranger, mistress penelope, mother telemachus, sent you;
 great grief, wishes hear anything can tell her
 husband, satisfied speaking the
 truth, will give shirt cloak, things
 want of. bread, can get enough that
 fill belly, begging town, letting give
 will.”
 
“i will tell penelope,” answered ulysses, “nothing strictly
 true. know husband, partner in
 affliction, afraid passing crowd cruel
 suitors, pride insolence reach heaven. just now,
 moreover, going house without harm, man
 gave blow hurt much, neither telemachus any
 one else defended me. tell penelope, therefore, patient wait
 till sundown. let give seat close fire, my
 clothes worn thin—you know are, seen them
 ever since first asked help me—she can ask the
 return husband.”
 
swineherd went back heard this, penelope said she
 saw cross threshold, “why bring here, eumaeus?
 afraid one will ill-treat him, shy coming
 inside house all? beggars shamefaced.”
 
answered, swineherd eumaeus, “the stranger quite
 reasonable. avoiding suitors, one
 else do. asks wait till sundown, will much
 better, madam, yourself, can
 hear talk will.”
 
“the man fool,” answered penelope, “it likely he
 says, abominable people whole world as
 men are.”
 
done speaking eumaeus went back suitors, had
 explained everything. went telemachus said ear
 none overhear him, “my dear sir, will now go back to
 pigs, see property business. will look
 going here, careful keep of
 danger, many bear ill will. may jove bring them
 bad end us mischief.”
 
“very well,” replied telemachus, “go home your
 dinner, morning come victims to
 sacrifice day. leave rest heaven me.”
 
eumaeus took seat again, finished his
 dinner left courts cloister men table, and
 went back pigs. suitors, presently began to
 amuse singing dancing, now getting on
 towards evening.

“be off, old man,” cried, “from doorway, shall dragged

 so? get then, go yourself, shall come blows.”
 
ulysses frowned said, “my friend, manner of

 tramp myself, perhaps gods will give us better luck and

irus angry answered, “you filthy glutton, run on
 trippingly like old fish-fag. good mind lay hands

 look on. will never able fight one much younger

thus roundly rate one another smooth pavement front
 doorway,149 antinous saw going laughed
 heartily said others, “this finest sport you
 ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like house. the
 stranger irus quarreled going fight, let us set
 once.”
 
suitors came laughing, gathered round two ragged
 tramps. “listen me,” said antinous, “there goats’ paunches
 fire, filled blood fat, set
 aside supper; victorious proves the
 better man shall pick lot; shall free our
 table will allow beggar house all.”
 
others agreed, ulysses, throw scent, said,
 “sirs, old man like myself, worn suffering, hold his
 young one; irrepressible belly urges on, though
 know can end getting drubbing. must swear,
 however none will give foul blow favour irus and

swore told them, completed oath
 telemachus put word said, “stranger, mind to

 whoever strikes will fight one. host, and
 chiefs, antinous eurymachus, men of
 understanding, mind am.”
 
every one assented, ulysses girded old rags loins,
 thus baring stalwart thighs, broad chest shoulders, his
 mighty arms; minerva came made limbs even
 stronger still. suitors beyond measure astonished, one
 turn towards neighbour saying, “the stranger brought such
 thigh old rags will soon nothing left of
 irus.”
 
irus began uneasy heard them, servants girded
 force, brought [into open part court] such
 fright limbs tremble. antinous scolded and
 said, “you swaggering bully, never born all

 say, therefore—and shall surely be—if beats proves
 better man, shall pack board ship the
 mainland send king echetus, kills every one comes
 near him. will cut nose ears, draw your
 entrails dogs eat.”
 
frightened irus still more, brought middle
 court, two men raised hands fight. ulysses
 considered whether let drive hard make end
 there, whether give lighter blow
 knock down; end deemed best give
 lighter blow fear achaeans begin suspect he
 was. began fight, irus hit ulysses right
 shoulder; ulysses gave irus blow neck ear that
 broke bones skull, blood came gushing his
 mouth; fell groaning dust, gnashing teeth kicking on
 ground, suitors threw hands nearly died of
 laughter, ulysses caught hold foot dragged him
 outer court far gate-house. propped up
 wall put staff hands. “sit here,” said he,
 “and keep dogs pigs off; pitiful creature, you
 try make king beggars shall fare still
 worse.”
 
threw dirty old wallet, tattered torn his
 shoulder cord hung, went back sit upon
 threshold; suitors went within cloisters, laughing and
 saluting him, “may jove, gods,” said they, “grant you
 whatever want put end importunity this
 insatiable tramp. will take mainland presently, to
 king echetus, kills every one comes near him.”
 
ulysses hailed good omen, antinous set great goat’s
 paunch filled blood fat. amphinomus took two loaves
 bread-basket brought him, pledging did
 golden goblet wine. “good luck you,” said, “father
 stranger, badly present, hope will have
 better times by.”
 
ulysses answered, “amphinomus, seem man good
 understanding, indeed may well be, seeing whose are. i

 wasting estate, dishonour wife, of
 one certain return day, that, too, long hence.
 nay, will soon; may heaven send home quietly first that

 suitors will part bloodlessly.”
 
words made drink-offering, drunk put
 gold cup hands amphinomus, walked away
 serious bowing head, foreboded evil. even did
 escape destruction, minerva doomed fall hand

 come.
 
minerva put mind penelope show the
 suitors, might make still enamoured her, win
 still honour husband. feigned mocking
 laugh said, “eurynome, changed mind, fancy to
 show suitors although detest them. like also
 give hint better anything do

“my dear child,” answered eurynome, “all said true, go
 tell it, first wash anoint your

 right grieve incessantly; telemachus, whom
 always prayed might live see beard, already

“i know, eurynome,” replied penelope, “that mean well, not
 try persuade wash anoint myself, heaven robbed me
 beauty day husband sailed; nevertheless, tell
 autonoe hippodamia want them. must am
 cloister; going among men alone; be
 proper so.”
 
old woman150 went room bid maids go to
 mistress. meantime minerva bethought another
 matter, sent penelope sweet slumber; lay on
 couch limbs became heavy sleep. goddess shed
 grace beauty achaeans might admire her. she
 washed face ambrosial loveliness venus wears she

 commanding figure, complexion whiter sawn

 talking.
 
“what exquisitely delicious sleep having,” said she, as
 passed hands face, “in spite misery. wish

words came upper room, alone but
 attended two maidens, reached suitors she
 stood one bearing-posts supporting roof cloister,
 holding veil face, staid maid servant either
 side her. beheld suitors overpowered and
 became desperately enamoured her, one prayed might
 win bed fellow.
 
“telemachus,” said she, addressing son, “i fear longer

“i surprised, dear mother, displeasure,” replied
 telemachus, “i understand know things as

thus converse. eurymachus came said, “queen

 whole world regards personal beauty strength of

penelope replied, “eurymachus, heaven robbed my

 without paying it.”
 
said, ulysses glad heard trying
 get presents suitors, flattering fair words
 knew mean.
 
antinous said, “queen penelope, daughter icarius, take many
 presents please one will give you; is
 well refuse present; will go business nor
 stir are, till married best man among us
 whoever may be.”
 
others applauded antinous said, one sent his
 servant bring present. antinous’s man returned large and
 lovely dress exquisitely embroidered. twelve beautifully
 made brooch pins pure gold fasten it. eurymachus
 immediately brought magnificent chain gold amber beads
 gleamed like sunlight. eurydamas’s two men returned some
 earrings fashioned three brilliant pendants glistened most
 beautifully; king pisander polyctor gave necklace of
 rarest workmanship, every one else brought beautiful
 present kind.
 
queen went back room upstairs, maids brought
 presents her. meanwhile suitors took singing and
 dancing, stayed till evening came. danced sang till it
 grew dark; brought three braziers151 give light, and
 piled chopped firewood old dry, lit
 torches them, maids held turn turn about. then
 ulysses said:
 
“maids, servants ulysses long absent, go the
 queen inside house; sit amuse her, spin, pick
 wool. will hold light people. may stay till
 morning, shall beat me, can stand great deal.”
 
maids looked one another laughed, pretty melantho
 began gibe contemptuously. daughter dolius, but
 brought penelope, used give toys play
 with, looked child; spite all
 showed consideration sorrows mistress, and
 used misconduct eurymachus, love.
 
“poor wretch,” said she, “are gone clean mind? go and
 sleep smithy, place public gossips, instead chattering

“vixen,” replied ulysses, scowling her, “i will go tell
 telemachus saying, will torn limb

words scared women, went body

 said. ulysses took stand near burning braziers, holding
 torches looking people—brooding things that
 surely come pass.
 
minerva let suitors one moment cease their
 insolence, wanted ulysses become even bitter against
 them; therefore set eurymachus polybus gibe him,
 made others laugh. “listen me,” said he, “you suitors of
 queen penelope, may speak even minded. for
 nothing man come house ulysses; believe the
 light coming torches, head—for
 hair gone, every bit it.”
 
turning ulysses said, “stranger, will work servant,
 send wolds see well paid? can you
 build stone fence, plant trees? will fed year

 rather fill belly going round country begging.”
 
“eurymachus,” answered ulysses, “if work one against

eurymachus furious this. scowled cried, “you

 ulysses sought protection knees amphinomus dulichium, for

 knocked down: man fell cry flat back, his
 wine-jug fell ringing ground. suitors covered
 cloister now uproar, one turn towards his
 neighbour, saying, “i wish stranger gone somewhere else, bad
 luck him, trouble gives us. permit such
 disturbance beggar; ill counsels prevail we
 shall pleasure banquet.”
 
telemachus came forward said, “sirs, mad? can you
 carry meat liquor decently? evil spirit has
 possessed you. wish drive away, had
 suppers, sooner go home bed better.”
 
suitors bit lips marvelled boldness speech;
 amphinomus nisus, aretias, said, “do not

 neither let us violence stranger ulysses’
 servants. let cupbearer go round drink-offerings, we

thus speak, saying pleased well, mulius of

telemachus ulysses remove armour—ulysses interviews

ulysses left cloister, pondering means whereby with
 minerva’s help might able kill suitors. presently said
 telemachus, “telemachus, must get armour together take it

“i wish, child,” answered euryclea, “that take management

“the stranger,” said telemachus, “shall show light; people

euryclea told, bolted women inside room.
 ulysses made haste take helmets, shields,
 spears inside; minerva went gold lamp her
 hand shed soft brilliant radiance, whereon telemachus said,
 “father, eyes behold great marvel: walls, rafters,
 crossbeams, supports rest aglow a
 flaming fire. surely god come from

“hush,” answered ulysses, “hold peace ask questions, for
 manner gods. get bed, leave here
 talk mother maids. mother grief will
 ask sorts questions.”
 
telemachus went torch-light side inner
 court, room always slept. lay bed
 till morning, ulysses left cloister pondering the
 means whereby minerva’s help might able kill suitors.
 
penelope came room looking like venus diana, and
 set seat inlaid scrolls silver ivory near the
 fire accustomed place. made icmalius a

 thick fleece: now sat, maids came the

 “stranger, mean plague us hanging house all

penelope heard saying scolded maid, “impudent

said head waiting woman eurynome, “bring seat a

eurynome brought seat set fleece upon it, soon

“madam,” answered ulysses, “who face whole earth can dare

 anointed oil, ulysses drew seat nearer fire warm
 himself, hid scar rags. penelope began talking
 said:
 
“stranger, like speak briefly another

 looked saw geese trough eating mash as

“this dream, madam,” replied ulysses, “can admit one

penelope answered, “stranger, dreams curious and

ulysses answered, “madam, wife ulysses, need defer your

ulysses sleep—penelope’s prayer diana—the two signs from
 heaven—eumaeus philoetius arrive—the suitors dine—ctesippus throws
 ox’s foot ulysses—theoclymenus foretells disaster leaves the
 house.
 

ulysses slept cloister upon undressed bullock’s hide, the
 top threw several skins sheep suitors eaten,

 there, then, ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon way he

thus chided heart, checked endurance, he

spoke shed sleep eyes, went back to
 olympus.
 
ulysses thus yielding deep slumber that
 eased burden sorrows, admirable wife awoke, sitting
 bed began cry. relieved weeping
 prayed diana saying, “great goddess diana, daughter jove,

 long can sleep night, eyes closed in
 slumber people forget good ill alike; whereas misery haunts me
 even dreams. night methought one lying my
 side like ulysses went away host,
 rejoiced, believed dream, truth
 itself.”
 
day broke, ulysses heard sound weeping, and
 puzzled him, seemed though already knew by
 side. gathered cloak fleeces had
 lain, set seat cloister, took bullock’s
 hide open. lifted hands heaven, prayed,
 saying “father jove, since seen fit bring land and
 home afflictions laid upon me,
 give sign mouth one are
 now waking within house, let another sign kind
 outside.”
 
thus pray. jove heard prayer forthwith thundered high up
 among clouds splendour olympus, ulysses glad
 heard it. time within house, miller-woman

 sign. twelve miller-women whose business grind
 wheat barley staff life. others ground

 “father jove,” said she, “you, rule heaven earth, have
 thundered clear sky without much cloud it, this
 means something somebody; grant prayer, then, poor
 servant calls upon you, let last day the
 suitors dine house ulysses. worn labour
 grinding meal them, hope may never another
 dinner anywhere all.”
 
ulysses glad heard omens conveyed woman’s
 speech, thunder, knew meant should
 avenge suitors.
 
maids house rose lit fire hearth;
 telemachus also rose put clothes. girded sword about
 shoulder, bound sandals comely feet, took a
 doughty spear point sharpened bronze; went the
 threshold cloister said euryclea, “nurse, make
 stranger comfortable regards bed board, let
 shift himself?—for mother, good woman though is, a
 way paying great attention second-rate people, neglecting
 others reality much better men.”
 
“do find fault child,” said euryclea, “when one find

 mother ask take bread said he
 not. wanted go bed told servants make

 sleep bed blankets; insisted an
 undressed bullock’s hide sheepskins put the
 cloister threw cloak myself.”157
 
telemachus went court place achaeans
 meeting assembly; spear hand, not
 alone, two dogs went him. euryclea called maids
 said, “come, wake up; set sweeping cloisters and
 sprinkling water lay dust; put covers the
 seats; wipe tables, you, wet sponge; clean out
 mixing-jugs cups, go water fountain at
 once; suitors will directly; will early, for
 feast day.”
 
thus speak, even said: twenty them
 went fountain water, others set busily to
 work house. men attendance suitors
 also came began chopping firewood. women returned
 fountain, swineherd came three
 best pigs pick out. let feed premises, and
 said good-humouredly ulysses, “stranger, suitors
 treating better now, insolent ever?”
 
“may heaven,” answered ulysses, “requite wickedness with
 deal high-handedly another man’s house without sense
 shame.”
 
thus converse; meanwhile melanthius goatherd came up, for
 bringing best goats suitors’ dinner; he
 two shepherds him. tied goats gatehouse,
 melanthius began gibing ulysses. “are still here,
 stranger,” said he, “to pester people begging house? why
 can go elsewhere? shall come understanding
 given taste fists. beg without

 achaeans, well here?”
 
ulysses made answer, bowed head brooded. third
 man, philoetius, joined them, bringing barren heifer and
 goats. brought boatmen to
 take people one comes them. philoetius made his
 heifer goats secure gatehouse, went to
 swineherd. “who, swineherd,” said he, “is stranger is
 lately come here? one men? family? does
 come from? poor fellow, looks great man,
 gods give sorrow will—even kings so

spoke went ulysses saluted right hand;
 “good day you, father stranger,” said he, “you seem very

“stockman,” answered ulysses, “you seem well-disposed

“if jove bring pass,” replied stockman, “you should

like manner eumaeus prayed ulysses might return home.
 
thus converse. meanwhile suitors hatching plot to
 murder telemachus: bird flew near left hand—an
 eagle dove talons. amphinomus said, “my friends,
 plot murder telemachus will succeed; let us go to
 dinner instead.”
 
others assented, went inside laid cloaks the
 benches seats. sacrificed sheep, goats, pigs, the
 heifer, inward meats cooked served round.
 mixed wine mixing-bowls, swineherd gave every
 man cup, philoetius handed round bread bread
 baskets, melanthius poured wine. laid
 hands upon good things them.
 
telemachus purposely made ulysses sit part cloister that
 paved stone;158 gave shabby looking seat little
 table himself, portion inward meats brought to
 him, wine gold cup. “sit there,” said he, “and drink your
 wine among great people. will put stop gibes blows
 suitors, public house, belongs ulysses,
 passed me. therefore, suitors, keep hands and
 tongues yourselves, will mischief.”
 
suitors bit lips, marvelled boldness his
 speech; antinous said, “we like language will
 put it, telemachus threatening us good earnest. if
 jove let us put stop brave talk ere now.”
 
thus spoke antinous, telemachus heeded not. meanwhile the
 heralds bringing holy hecatomb city, the
 achaeans gathered shady grove apollo.
 
roasted outer meat, drew spits, gave every man
 portion, feasted heart’s content; waited at
 table gave ulysses exactly portion others had, for
 telemachus told so.
 
minerva let suitors one moment drop their
 insolence, wanted ulysses become still bitter against
 them. now happened among ribald fellow, whose name
 ctesippus, came same. man, confident great
 wealth, paying court wife ulysses, said the
 suitors, “hear say. stranger already as
 large portion one else; well, right nor
 reasonable ill-treat guest telemachus comes here. will,
 however, make present account, may have
 something give bath-woman, ulysses’
 servants.”
 
spoke picked heifer’s foot meat-basket which
 lay, threw ulysses, ulysses turned head little
 aside, avoided it, smiling grimly sardinian fashion159 did
 so, hit wall, him. telemachus spoke fiercely to
 ctesippus, “it good thing you,” said he, “that stranger
 turned head missed him. hit should

held peace till last agelaus damastor said,
 “no one take offence just said, gainsay it,
 quite reasonable. leave off, therefore, ill-treating the
 stranger, one else servants house; i
 say, however, friendly word telemachus mother, which
 trust may commend both. ‘as long,’ say, ‘as had

 now sufficiently clear will never so; therefore talk all
 quietly mother, tell marry best man,

 able manage inheritance, eat drink

telemachus answered, “by jove, agelaus, sorrows of
 unhappy father, either perished far ithaca, is
 wandering distant land, throw obstacles way my
 mother’s marriage; contrary urge choose whomsoever she
 will, will give numberless gifts bargain, dare
 insist point blank shall leave house own

minerva now made suitors fall laughing immoderately, set
 wits wandering; laughing forced laughter.

 hearts heavy forebodings. theoclymenus saw and
 said, “unhappy men, ails you? shroud of
 darkness drawn head foot, cheeks wet with
 tears; air alive wailing voices; walls roof-beams

 full ghosts trooping night hell; sun blotted

thus speak, laughed heartily. eurymachus
 said, “this stranger lately come lost senses.

 welcome, suitors kept looking one another provoking
 telemachus laughing strangers. one insolent fellow said to
 him, “telemachus, happy guests; first this
 importunate tramp, comes begging bread wine skill

 another fellow setting prophet. let me
 persuade you, will much better put board ship and

telemachus gave heed, sat silently watching father,
 expecting every moment begin attack upon suitors.
 
meanwhile daughter icarius, wise penelope, rich seat
 placed facing court cloisters, hear

“listen suitors, persist abusing hospitality of

 ulysses, whomsoever shall string easily send his
 arrow one twelve axes, will follow quit this

 even doubt shall remember dreams.”
 
spoke, told eumaeus set bow pieces iron

 bow, antinous scolded them. “you country louts,” said he, “silly

said, time expecting able to

telemachus spoke. “great heavens!” exclaimed, “jove must have

put bow down, letting lean door,164 with

 saying:
 
“leiodes, talking about? words monstrous and
 intolerable; makes angry listen you. shall, then, bow

said melanthius goatherd, “look sharp, light fire in
 court, set seat hard sheep skin it; bring us
 also large ball lard, house. let us
 warm bow grease it—we will make trial again, and
 bring contest end.”
 
melanthius lit fire, set seat covered sheep skins beside
 it. also brought great ball lard the
 house, suitors warmed bow made trial it, but
 none nearly strong enough string it. nevertheless
 still remained antinous eurymachus, ringleaders
 among suitors much foremost among all.
 
swineherd stockman left cloisters together, and
 ulysses followed them. got outside gates the
 outer yard, ulysses said quietly:
 
“stockman, swineherd, something mind in
 doubt whether say no; think will say it. manner of
 men stand ulysses, god bring back
 sudden? say disposed do—to side the
 suitors, ulysses?”
 
“father jove,” answered stockman, “would indeed might so
 ordain it. god bring ulysses back, see
 might main fight him.”
 
like words eumaeus prayed gods ulysses might return;
 when, therefore, saw certain mind of, ulysses
 said, “it i, ulysses, here. suffered much, at
 last, twentieth year, come back country. find
 two alone servants glad so, for

spoke drew rags aside great scar, they
 examined thoroughly, wept ulysses, threw
 arms round him, kissed head shoulders, ulysses
 kissed hands faces return. sun gone down
 upon mourning ulysses checked said:
 
“cease weeping, lest one come outside see us, and
 tell within. go in, separately, both
 together; will go first, follow afterwards; let this
 moreover token us; suitors will try to
 prevent getting hold bow quiver; you, therefore,
 eumaeus, place hands carrying about, tell
 women close doors apartment. hear any

 come out; must keep quiet, stay work.
 charge you, philoetius, make fast doors outer
 court, bind securely once.”
 
thus spoken, went back house took seat
 left. presently, two servants followed inside.
 
moment bow hands eurymachus, warming
 fire, even string it, greatly
 grieved. heaved deep sigh said, “i grieve for
 us all; grieve shall forgo marriage, not
 care nearly much this, plenty women in
 ithaca elsewhere; feel fact so
 inferior ulysses strength string bow. this
 will disgrace us eyes yet unborn.”
 
“it shall so, eurymachus,” said antinous, “and know it
 yourself. today feast apollo throughout land; can
 string bow day this? put one side—as axes
 can stay are, one likely come house
 take away: let cupbearer go round cups, we
 may make drink-offerings drop matter bow; will
 tell melanthius bring us goats tomorrow—the best has; we
 can offer thigh bones apollo mighty archer, make
 trial bow, bring contest end.”
 
rest approved words, thereon men servants poured water over
 hands guests, pages filled mixing-bowls wine
 water handed round giving every man his
 drink-offering. then, made offerings drunk
 much desired, ulysses craftily said:—
 
“suitors illustrious queen, listen may speak even am
 minded. appeal especially eurymachus, antinous has
 just spoken much reason. cease shooting present and
 leave matter gods, morning let heaven give
 victory will. moment, however, give bow that
 may prove power hands among all, see whether i
 still much strength used have, whether travel and
 neglect made end it.”
 
made angry, feared might string bow,
 antinous therefore rebuked fiercely saying, “wretched creature, you
 much grain sense whole body; to
 think lucky allowed dine unharmed among your
 betters, without smaller portion served others
 had, allowed hear conversation. other
 beggar stranger allowed hear say among
 ourselves; wine must mischief, does
 drink immoderately. wine inflamed the
 centaur eurytion staying peirithous among the
 lapithae. wine got head, went mad ill

 assembled, rushed cut ears and
 nostrils; dragged doorway house,
 went away crazed, bore burden crime, bereft of

 centaurs, brought upon own
 drunkenness. like manner can tell will go hardly with
 string bow: will find mercy one here,
 shall ship king echetus, kills every one
 comes near him: will never get away alive, drink keep
 quiet without getting quarrel men younger yourself.”
 
penelope spoke him. “antinous,” said she, “it right that
 ill-treat guest telemachus comes house.
 stranger prove strong enough string mighty bow of
 ulysses, can suppose take home make
 wife? even man can idea mind:
 none need let disturb feasting; all
 reason.”
 
“queen penelope,” answered eurymachus, “we suppose man
 will take away him; impossible; afraid lest
 baser sort, men women among achaeans, go
 gossiping say, ‘these suitors feeble folk; are
 paying court wife brave man whose bow one was
 able string, yet beggarly tramp came house strung
 sent arrow iron.’ will be
 said, will scandal us.”
 
“eurymachus,” penelope answered, “people persist eating the
 estate great chieftain dishonouring house must expect
 others think well them. mind men talk as
 think will? stranger strong well-built, says
 moreover noble birth. give bow, let us see
 whether can string no. say—and shall surely be—that if
 apollo vouchsafes glory stringing it, will give a
 cloak shirt good wear, javelin keep dogs and
 robbers, sharp sword. will also give sandals, will see
 sent safely wherever wants go.”
 
telemachus said, “mother, man either ithaca in
 islands elis right let one
 bow refuse it. one shall force one way the
 other, even though choose make stranger present the
 bow outright, let take away him. go, then, within the
 house busy daily duties, loom, your
 distaff, ordering servants. bow man’s matter,
 mine others, master here.”
 
went wondering back house, laid son’s saying in
 heart. going upstairs handmaids room, she
 mourned dear husband till minerva sent sweet sleep her
 eyelids.
 
swineherd now took bow taking ulysses, but
 suitors clamoured parts cloisters, one
 said, “you idiot, taking bow to? out
 wits? apollo gods will grant prayer, your
 boarhounds shall get quiet little place, worry
 death.”
 
eumaeus frightened outcry raised, put bow
 there, telemachus shouted other
 side cloisters, threatened saying, “father eumaeus,
 bring bow spite them, young will pelt you
 stones back country, better man two. i
 wish much stronger suitors house as
 you, soon send sick sorry, for
 mean mischief.”
 
thus speak, laughed heartily, put
 better humour telemachus; eumaeus brought bow on
 placed hands ulysses. done this, called
 euryclea apart said her, “euryclea, telemachus says to
 close doors women’s apartments. hear groaning or
 uproar men fighting house, come out,
 keep quiet stay work.”
 
euryclea told closed doors women’s
 apartments.
 
meanwhile philoetius slipped quietly made fast gates the
 outer court. ship’s cable byblus fibre lying the
 gatehouse, made gates fast came again,
 resuming seat left, keeping eye ulysses, who
 now got bow hands, turning every way about,
 proving see whether worms eating into

 neighbour saying, “this tricky old bow-fancier; either has
 got one like home, wants make one, workmanlike

another said, “i hope may successful things than
 likely stringing bow.”
 
ulysses, taken examined over, strung
 easily skilled bard strings new peg lyre makes
 twisted gut fast ends. took right hand to
 prove string, sang sweetly touch like the
 twittering swallow. suitors dismayed, turned colour
 heard it; moment, moreover, jove thundered loudly a

took arrow lying upon table165—for the
 achaeans shortly taste inside quiver—he

“run fetch them,” answered ulysses, “while arrows hold out, or

telemachus father said, went store room where
 armour kept. chose four shields, eight spears, four
 brass helmets horse-hair plumes. brought speed to
 father, armed first, stockman the
 swineherd also put armour, took places near ulysses.
 meanwhile ulysses, long arrows lasted, shooting the
 suitors one one, fell thick one another: arrows

telemachus answered, “the fault, father, mine, mine only; left

ulysses answered, “telemachus will hold suitors check,

suitors now aimed second time, minerva made their

euryclea heard unfastened door women’s room

thus converse, presently mercury came the
 ghosts suitors killed ulysses. ghosts of
 agamemnon achilles astonished seeing them, went to
 once. ghost agamemnon recognised amphimedon of
 melaneus, lived ithaca host, began to
 talk him.
 
“amphimedon,” said, “what happened fine young men—all
 age too—that come ground? one could
 pick finer body men city. neptune raise winds
 waves sea, enemies make an
 end mainland cattle-lifting or
 sheep-stealing, fighting defence wives city?
 answer question, guest. remember how

 ships troy? whole month ere resume our

ghost amphimedon answered, “agamemnon, atreus, king
 men, remember everything said, will tell you
 fully accurately way end brought about.
 ulysses long gone, courting wife, not
 say point blank marry, yet bring matters an
 end, meant compass destruction: this, then, the
 trick played us. set great tambour frame room and
 began work enormous piece fine needlework. ‘sweethearts,’
 said she, ‘ulysses indeed dead, still, press marry
 immediately; wait—for skill needlework

 finding out, time wore now fourth

“then malicious god conveyed ulysses upland farm his
 swineherd lives. thither presently came also son, returning a
 voyage pylos, two came town hatched
 plot destruction. telemachus came first, after
 him, accompanied swineherd, came ulysses, clad rags and
 leaning staff though miserable old beggar. came
 unexpectedly none us knew him, even older ones among
 us, reviled threw things him. endured being
 struck insulted without word, though house; but
 will aegis-bearing jove inspired him, telemachus
 took armour hid inner chamber, bolting doors
 behind them. cunningly made wife offer bow a

 brains battered in, ground seethed our

 lying still uncared house ulysses, friends at
 home yet know happened, lay us out

“happy ulysses, laertes,” replied ghost agamemnon, “you

 excellence understanding, faithful wedded lord as
 penelope daughter icarius. fame, therefore, virtue
 shall never die, immortals shall compose song shall be
 welcome mankind honour constancy penelope. far
 otherwise wickedness daughter tyndareus killed
 lawful husband; song shall hateful among men, has
 brought disgrace womankind even good ones.”
 
thus converse house hades deep within the
 bowels earth. meanwhile ulysses others passed the
 town soon reached fair well-tilled farm laertes, which
 reclaimed infinite labour. house, a
 lean-to running round it, slaves worked slept
 sat ate, inside house old sicel woman,
 looked country-farm. ulysses got there,
 said two:
 
“go house, kill best pig can find dinner.
 meanwhile want see whether father will know me, fail to
 recognise long absence.”
 
took armour gave eumaeus philoetius, who
 went straight house, turned vineyard to
 make trial father. went great orchard, he
 see dolius, sons bondsmen, for
 gathering thorns make fence vineyard, the
 place old man told them; therefore found father
 alone, hoeing vine. dirty old shirt, patched very
 shabby; legs bound round thongs oxhide save him
 brambles, also wore sleeves leather; goat
 skin cap head, looking woe-begone. ulysses saw
 worn, old full sorrow, stood still tall
 pear tree began weep. doubted whether embrace him, kiss
 him, tell come home, whether should
 first question see say. end deemed it
 best crafty him, mind went father,
 bending digging plant.
 
“i see, sir,” said ulysses, “that excellent gardener—what
 pains take it, sure. single plant, a
 fig tree, vine, olive, pear, flower bed, bears trace of
 attention. trust, however, will offended i

 cup solid silver flowers chased upon it. gave twelve
 light cloaks, many pieces tapestry; also gave twelve
 cloaks single fold, twelve rugs, twelve fair mantles, equal
 number shirts. added four good looking women skilled
 useful arts, let take choice.”
 
father shed tears answered, “sir, indeed come the
 country named, fallen hands wicked
 people. wealth presents given purpose. if
 found friend alive ithaca, have
 entertained hospitably requited presents amply
 left him—as right considering you
 already given him. tell me, tell true, many years is

 offices due departed. now, tell truly want know.
 whence you—tell town parents? the
 ship lying brought men ithaca? a
 passenger man’s ship, brought have
 gone way left you?”
 
“i will tell everything,” answered ulysses, “quite truly. come

 will. ship lying yonder, open
 country outside town, fifth year since ulysses left

 me. birds flew right hands, rejoiced
 see parted, every hope have
 another friendly meeting exchange presents.”
 
dark cloud sorrow fell upon laertes listened. filled both
 hands dust ground poured grey
 head, groaning heavily so. heart ulysses touched,
 nostrils quivered looked upon father; sprang
 towards him, flung arms kissed him, saying, “i he,
 father, asking—i returned been
 away twenty years. cease sighing lamentation—we have
 time lose, tell killing the
 suitors house, punish insolence crimes.”
 
“if really ulysses,” replied laertes, “and come
 back again, must give manifest proof identity as
 shall convince me.”
 
“first observe scar,” answered ulysses, “which got boar’s
 tusk hunting mt. parnassus. mother sent me
 autolycus, mother’s father, receive presents he
 promised give me. furthermore will point out
 trees vineyard gave me, asked all
 followed round garden. went all,
 told names were. gave me
 thirteen pear trees, ten apple trees, forty fig trees; also
 said give fifty rows vines; corn planted
 row, yield grapes every kind heat of
 heaven laid heavy upon them.”
 
laertes’ strength failed heard convincing proofs which
 given him. threw arms him, ulysses to
 support him, gone swoon; soon he
 came to, beginning recover senses, said, “o father
 jove, gods still olympus all, suitors have
 really punished insolence folly. nevertheless, am
 much afraid shall townspeople ithaca here
 directly, will sending messengers everywhere throughout the
 cities cephallenians.”
 
ulysses answered, “take heart trouble that,
 let us go house hard garden. already told
 telemachus, philoetius, eumaeus go get dinner ready
 soon possible.”
 
thus conversing two made way towards house. got
 found telemachus stockman swineherd cutting
 meat mixing wine water. old sicel woman took
 laertes inside washed anointed oil. put on
 good cloak, minerva came gave imposing
 presence, making taller stouter before. came back
 surprised see looking like immortal, said
 him, “my dear father, one gods making much
 taller better-looking.”
 
laertes answered, “would, father jove, minerva, apollo, i
 man ruled among cephallenians, took
 nericum, strong fortress foreland. still i
 house yesterday armour on, i
 able stand help suitors.
 killed great many them, rejoiced
 see it.”
 
thus converse; others, finished their
 work feast ready, left working, took his
 proper place benches seats. began eating; and
 old dolius sons left work came up, their
 mother, sicel woman looked laertes now was
 growing old, fetch them. saw ulysses were
 certain he, stood lost astonishment; ulysses
 scolded good naturedly said, “sit dinner, old
 man, never mind surprise; wanting begin
 time waiting you.”
 
dolius put hands went ulysses. “sir,” said
 he, seizing master’s hand kissing wrist, “we have
 long wishing home: now heaven restored us after
 given hoping. hail, therefore, may gods prosper
 you.187 tell me, penelope already know return, or
 shall send one tell her?”
 
“old man,” answered ulysses, “she knows already, need not
 trouble that.” took seat, sons dolius
 gathered round ulysses give greeting embrace one after
 other; took seats due order near dolius their
 father.
 
thus busy getting dinner ready, rumour went round
 town, noised abroad terrible fate befallen the
 suitors; soon, therefore, people heard gathered
 every quarter, groaning hooting house ulysses.
 took dead away, buried every man own, put bodies
 came elsewhere board fishing vessels, the
 fishermen take place. met angrily
 place assembly, got together eupeithes
 rose speak. overwhelmed grief death son
 antinous, first man killed ulysses, said,
 weeping bitterly, “my friends, man done achaeans great
 wrong. took many best men away fleet, he
 lost ships men; now, moreover, return been
 killing foremost men among cephallenians. let us and
 can get away pylos elis epeans rule,
 shall ashamed ever afterwards. will an
 everlasting disgrace us avenge murder sons
 brothers. part pleasure life,
 rather die once. let us up, then, them, before
 can cross main land.”
 
wept spoke every one pitied him. medon bard
 phemius now woke up, came house ulysses.
 every one astonished seeing them, stood middle
 assembly, medon said, “hear me, men ithaca. ulysses did
 things will heaven. saw an
 immortal god take form mentor stand beside him. god
 appeared, now front encouraging him, now going furiously
 court attacking suitors whereon fell thick on
 one another.”
 
pale fear laid hold them, old halitherses, of
 mastor, rose speak, man among knew both
 past future; spoke plainly honesty,
 saying,
 
“men ithaca, fault things turned as
 have; listen me, yet mentor, bade
 check folly sons much wrong the
 wantonness hearts—wasting substance dishonouring the
 wife chieftain thought return. now, however,
 let say, tell you. go against
 ulysses, may find drawing evil your
 heads.”
 
said, half raised loud shout, at
 left assembly. rest stayed were, the
 speech halitherses displeased them, sided eupeithes;
 therefore hurried armour, armed
 themselves, met together front city, eupeithes led
 folly. thought going avenge murder of
 son, whereas truth never return, to
 perish attempt.
 
minerva said jove, “father, saturn, king kings,
 answer question—what propose do? will set them
 fighting still further, will make peace them?”
 
jove answered, “my child, ask me? your
 arrangement ulysses came home took revenge upon the
 suitors? whatever like, will tell think will be
 reasonable arrangement. now ulysses revenged, let them
 swear solemn covenant, virtue shall continue to
 rule, cause others forgive forget massacre of
 sons brothers. let become friends as
 heretofore, let peace plenty reign.”
 
minerva already eager bring about, she
 darted topmost summits olympus.
 
now laertes others done dinner, ulysses began by
 saying, “some go see getting close to
 us.” one dolius’s sons went bid. standing the
 threshold see quite near, said ulysses, “here
 are, let us put armour once.”
 
put armour fast could—that say ulysses,
 three men, six sons dolius. laertes also dolius did
 same—warriors necessity spite grey hair. they
 put armour, opened gate sallied forth,
 ulysses leading way.
 
jove’s daughter minerva came them, assumed form
 voice mentor. ulysses glad saw her, said his
 telemachus, “telemachus, now fight an
 engagement, will show every man’s mettle, sure disgrace
 ancestors, eminent strength courage the
 world over.”
 
“you say truly, dear father,” answered telemachus, “and shall
 see, will, mind disgrace family.”
 
laertes delighted heard this. “good heavens,” exclaimed,
 “what day enjoying: indeed rejoice it. and
 grandson vying one another matter valour.”
 
minerva came close said, “son arceisius—-best
 friend world—pray blue-eyed damsel, jove
 father; poise spear hurl it.”
 
spoke infused fresh vigour him, prayed
 poised spear hurled it. hit eupeithes’ helmet, and
 spear went right it, helmet stayed not, his
 armour rang rattling round fell heavily ground.
 meantime ulysses fell upon front line foe and
 smote swords spears; indeed, killed
 every one them, prevented ever getting home again,
 minerva raised voice aloud, made every one pause. “men of
 ithaca,” cried, “cease dreadful war, settle matter at
 without bloodshed.”
 
pale fear seized every one; frightened their
 arms dropped hands fell upon ground sound of
 goddess’ voice, fled back city lives. but
 ulysses gave great cry, gathering together swooped down
 like soaring eagle. saturn sent thunderbolt fire
 fell just front minerva, said ulysses, “ulysses,
 noble laertes, stop warful strife, jove will angry
 you.”
 
thus spoke minerva, ulysses obeyed gladly. minerva assumed
 form voice mentor, presently made covenant peace
 two contending parties.
