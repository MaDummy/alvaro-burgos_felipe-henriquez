 morning, fearing encounter dark large loose masses which
 float breaking ice. profited time to

 asked several questions concerning progress different branches

 partly contempt, mentioned names alchemists principal

 said, “really spent time studying nonsense?”
 
replied affirmative. “every minute,” continued m. krempe with
 warmth, “every instant wasted books utterly

 waldman, never seen, hitherto town.

 began lecture recapitulation history chemistry and
 various improvements made different men learning, pronouncing
 fervour names distinguished discoverers. took
 cursory view present state science explained many of
 elementary terms. made preparatory experiments, he
 concluded panegyric upon modern chemistry, terms i
 shall never forget:
 
“the ancient teachers science,” said he,
 “promised impossibilities performed nothing. modern masters
 promise little; know metals transmuted that

 nature show works hiding-places. ascend the
 heavens; discovered blood circulates, nature of

 “welcome, dearest victor,” said he. “ah! wish you
 come three months ago, found us joyous and
 delighted. come us now share misery nothing can
 alleviate; yet presence will, hope, revive father, seems
 sinking misfortune; persuasions will induce poor
 elizabeth cease vain tormenting self-accusations.—poor
 william! darling pride!”
 
tears, unrestrained, fell brother’s eyes; sense mortal
 agony crept frame. before, imagined the
 wretchedness desolated home; reality came new, and
 less terrible, disaster. tried calm ernest; enquired more
 minutely concerning father, named cousin.
 
“she all,” said ernest, “requires consolation; accused
 caused death brother, made her
 wretched. since murderer discovered—”
 
“the murderer discovered! good god! can be? attempt
 pursue him? impossible; one might well try overtake the
 winds, confine mountain-stream straw. saw too; he

“i know mean,” replied brother, accents of
 wonder, “but us discovery made completes misery. no
 one believe first; even now elizabeth will be

 justine moritz, amiable, fond family,
 suddenly become capable frightful, appalling crime?”
 
“justine moritz! poor, poor girl, accused? is
 wrongfully; every one knows that; one believes it, surely, ernest?”
 
“no one first; several circumstances came out, have
 almost forced conviction upon us; behaviour so
 confused, add evidence facts weight that, fear,

related that, morning murder poor william

strange tale, shake faith; replied
 earnestly, “you mistaken; know murderer. justine, poor,
 good justine, innocent.”
 
instant father entered. saw unhappiness deeply impressed
 countenance, endeavoured welcome cheerfully; and,
 exchanged mournful greeting, introduced
 topic disaster, ernest exclaimed,
 “good god, papa! victor says knows murderer of
 poor william.”
 
“we also, unfortunately,” replied father, “for indeed had
 rather ever ignorant discovered much
 depravity ungratitude one valued highly.”
 
“my dear father, mistaken; justine innocent.”
 
“if is, god forbid suffer guilty. be
 tried today, hope, sincerely hope, will acquitted.”
 
speech calmed me. firmly convinced mind that
 justine, indeed every human being, guiltless murder. i
 fear, therefore, circumstantial evidence be
 brought forward strong enough convict her. tale one to
 announce publicly; astounding horror looked upon as
 madness vulgar. one indeed exist, except i, the
 creator, believe, unless senses convinced him, the

“she innocent, elizabeth,” said i, “and shall

“how kind generous are! every one else believes guilt,
 made wretched, knew impossible: to
 see every one else prejudiced deadly manner rendered me
 hopeless despairing.” wept.
 
“dearest niece,” said father, “dry tears. she
 is, believe, innocent, rely justice laws, the
 activity shall prevent slightest shadow of
 partiality.”

 entered: heard arrive, hastened welcome me:
 “welcome, dearest victor,” said he. “ah! wish you
 come three months ago, found us joyous and
 delighted. come us now share misery nothing can
 alleviate; yet presence will, hope, revive father, seems
 sinking misfortune; persuasions will induce poor
 elizabeth cease vain tormenting self-accusations.—poor
 william! darling pride!”
 
tears, unrestrained, fell brother’s eyes; sense mortal
 agony crept frame. before, imagined the
 wretchedness desolated home; reality came new, and
 less terrible, disaster. tried calm ernest; enquired more
 minutely concerning father, named cousin.
 
“she all,” said ernest, “requires consolation; accused
 caused death brother, made her
 wretched. since murderer discovered—”
 
“the murderer discovered! good god! can be? attempt
 pursue him? impossible; one might well try overtake the

“i know mean,” replied brother, accents of
 wonder, “but us discovery made completes misery. no

“justine moritz! poor, poor girl, accused? is
 wrongfully; every one knows that; one believes it, surely, ernest?”
 
“no one first; several circumstances came out, have
 almost forced conviction upon us; behaviour so
 confused, add evidence facts weight that, fear,

related that, morning murder poor william

strange tale, shake faith; replied
 earnestly, “you mistaken; know murderer. justine, poor,
 good justine, innocent.”
 
instant father entered. saw unhappiness deeply impressed
 countenance, endeavoured welcome cheerfully; and,
 exchanged mournful greeting, introduced
 topic disaster, ernest exclaimed,
 “good god, papa! victor says knows murderer of
 poor william.”
 
“we also, unfortunately,” replied father, “for indeed had
 rather ever ignorant discovered much
 depravity ungratitude one valued highly.”
 
“my dear father, mistaken; justine innocent.”
 
“if is, god forbid suffer guilty. be
 tried today, hope, sincerely hope, will acquitted.”
 
speech calmed me. firmly convinced mind that
 justine, indeed every human being, guiltless murder. i
 fear, therefore, circumstantial evidence be
 brought forward strong enough convict her. tale one to
 announce publicly; astounding horror looked upon as
 madness vulgar. one indeed exist, except i, the
 creator, believe, unless senses convinced him, the

“she innocent, elizabeth,” said i, “and shall

“how kind generous are! every one else believes guilt,

“dearest niece,” said father, “dry tears. she

 said, “really spent time studying nonsense?”
 
replied affirmative. “every minute,” continued m. krempe with

“the ancient teachers science,” said he,
 “promised impossibilities performed nothing. modern masters

six years elapsed, passed dream one indelible trace, i
 stood place last embraced father my

 air dignity beauty, hardly permitted the

 tears flowed looked upon it. thus engaged, ernest
 entered: heard arrive, hastened welcome me:
 “welcome, dearest victor,” said he. “ah! wish you
 come three months ago, found us joyous and
 delighted. come us now share misery nothing can
 alleviate; yet presence will, hope, revive father, seems
 sinking misfortune; persuasions will induce poor
 elizabeth cease vain tormenting self-accusations.—poor
 william! darling pride!”
 
tears, unrestrained, fell brother’s eyes; sense mortal
 agony crept frame. before, imagined the
 wretchedness desolated home; reality came new, and
 less terrible, disaster. tried calm ernest; enquired more
 minutely concerning father, named cousin.
 
“she all,” said ernest, “requires consolation; accused
 caused death brother, made her
 wretched. since murderer discovered—”
 
“the murderer discovered! good god! can be? attempt
 pursue him? impossible; one might well try overtake the
 winds, confine mountain-stream straw. saw too; he
 free last night!”
 
“i know mean,” replied brother, accents of
 wonder, “but us discovery made completes misery. no
 one believe first; even now elizabeth will be
 convinced, notwithstanding evidence. indeed, credit
 justine moritz, amiable, fond family,
 suddenly become capable frightful, appalling crime?”
 
“justine moritz! poor, poor girl, accused? is
 wrongfully; every one knows that; one believes it, surely, ernest?”
 
“no one first; several circumstances came out, have
 almost forced conviction upon us; behaviour so
 confused, add evidence facts weight that, fear,
 leaves hope doubt. will tried today, will
 hear all.”
 
related that, morning murder poor william
 discovered, justine taken ill, confined her
 bed several days. interval, one servants,
 happening examine apparel worn night the
 murder, discovered pocket picture mother, which
 judged temptation murderer. servant
 instantly showed one others, who, without saying word to
 family, went magistrate; and, upon deposition,
 justine apprehended. charged fact, poor girl
 confirmed suspicion great measure extreme confusion of
 manner.
 
strange tale, shake faith; replied
 earnestly, “you mistaken; know murderer. justine, poor,
 good justine, innocent.”
 
instant father entered. saw unhappiness deeply impressed
 countenance, endeavoured welcome cheerfully; and,
 exchanged mournful greeting, introduced
 topic disaster, ernest exclaimed,
 “good god, papa! victor says knows murderer of
 poor william.”
 
“we also, unfortunately,” replied father, “for indeed had
 rather ever ignorant discovered much
 depravity ungratitude one valued highly.”
 
“my dear father, mistaken; justine innocent.”
 
“if is, god forbid suffer guilty. be
 tried today, hope, sincerely hope, will acquitted.”
 
speech calmed me. firmly convinced mind that
 justine, indeed every human being, guiltless murder. i
 fear, therefore, circumstantial evidence be
 brought forward strong enough convict her. tale one to
 announce publicly; astounding horror looked upon as
 madness vulgar. one indeed exist, except i, the
 creator, believe, unless senses convinced him, the
 existence living monument presumption rash ignorance
 let loose upon world?
 
soon joined elizabeth. time altered since last
 beheld her; endowed loveliness surpassing beauty of
 childish years. candour, vivacity, but
 allied expression full sensibility intellect.
 welcomed greatest affection. “your arrival, dear
 cousin,” said she, “fills hope. perhaps will find some
 means justify poor guiltless justine. alas! safe, she
 convicted crime? rely innocence certainly do
 upon own. misfortune doubly hard us; only
 lost lovely darling boy, poor girl, sincerely
 love, torn away even worse fate. condemned, i
 never shall know joy more. will not, sure will not;

“she innocent, elizabeth,” said i, “and shall
 proved; fear nothing, let spirits cheered assurance
 acquittal.”
 
“how kind generous are! every one else believes guilt,
 made wretched, knew impossible: to
 see every one else prejudiced deadly manner rendered me
 hopeless despairing.” wept.
 
“dearest niece,” said father, “dry tears. she
 is, believe, innocent, rely justice laws, the
 activity shall prevent slightest shadow of
 partiality.”
