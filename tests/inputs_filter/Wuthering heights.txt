 lazy intention, stepping room, saw servant-girl

“sit down,” said young man, gruffly. “he’ll soon.”
 
obeyed; hemmed, called villain juno, deigned, this
 second interview, move extreme tip tail, token of
 owning acquaintance.
 
“a beautiful animal!” commenced again. “do intend parting with
 little ones, madam?”
 
“they mine,” said amiable hostess, repellingly than
 heathcliff replied.
 
“ah, favourites among these?” continued, turning an
 obscure cushion full something like cats.
 
“a strange choice favourites!” observed scornfully.

“my amiable lady!” interrupted, almost diabolical sneer on

 mother nursed mr. hindley earnshaw, hareton’s father, and
 got used playing children: ran errands too, helped
 make hay, hung farm ready anything anybody
 set to. one fine summer morning—it beginning of
 harvest, remember—mr. earnshaw, old master, came downstairs,
 dressed journey; and, told joseph be

 eating porridge them—and said, speaking son, “now, my
 bonny man, i’m going liverpool to-day, shall bring you? you
 may choose like: let little, shall walk there
 back: sixty miles way, long spell!” hindley named a

 forget me; kind heart, though rather severe
 sometimes. promised bring pocketful apples pears, and
 kissed children, said good-bye, set off.
 
seemed long us all—the three days absence—and
 often little cathy ask home. mrs. earnshaw

“and end flighted death!” said, opening his

 never beaten anything life: must e’en take it

crowded round, miss cathy’s head peep dirty,
 ragged, black-haired child; big enough walk talk: indeed,
 face looked older catherine’s; yet set its
 feet, stared round, repeated some
 gibberish nobody understand. frightened, mrs.
 earnshaw ready fling doors: fly up, asking how

 conclusion was, mistress grumbled calm; mr.

 hindley hated him: say truth same; plagued

seemed sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, ill-treatment:
 stand hindley’s blows without winking shedding tear, and
 pinches moved draw breath open eyes, if

 endurance made old earnshaw furious, discovered son
 persecuting poor fatherless child, called him. took to
 heathcliff strangely, believing said (for matter, said
 precious little, generally truth), petting far above
 cathy, mischievous wayward favourite.
 
so, beginning, bred bad feeling house; at
 mrs. earnshaw’s death, happened less two years after, the
 young master learned regard father oppressor rather

 “you will to: speak blows, you’ll get again

 standing still, “and i’ll tell boasted turn

 fell, staggered immediately, breathless white; and,
 prevented it, gone just master, and
 got full revenge letting condition plead him, intimating who
 caused it. “take colt, gipsy, then!” said young earnshaw. “and i
 pray may break neck: take him, damned, beggarly

heathcliff gone loose beast, shift stall;
 passing behind it, hindley finished speech knocking

“oh, joseph will tell,” suggested; “you’d better go!”
 
“joseph loading lime side penistone crags; will

“order ellen say engaged, cathy,” persisted; “don’t turn
 pitiful, silly friends yours! i’m point,
 sometimes, complaining they—but i’ll not—”
 
“that what?” cried catherine, gazing troubled

“nothing—only look almanack wall;” pointed a
 framed sheet hanging near window, continued, “the crosses are

“yes—very foolish: took notice!” replied catherine, a
 peevish tone. “and sense that?”
 
“to show _do_ take notice,” said heathcliff.
 
“and always sitting you?” demanded, growing more
 irritated. “what good get? talk about? might be
 dumb, baby, anything say amuse me, anything you

“you never told talked little, you
 disliked company, cathy!” exclaimed heathcliff, much agitation.
 
“it’s company all, people know nothing say nothing,” she
 muttered.

“i hate fidgeting _my_ presence,” exclaimed young lady
 imperiously, allowing guest time speak: failed to

“i’m sorry it, miss catherine,” response; proceeded
 assiduously occupation.
 
she, supposing edgar see her, snatched cloth my

“catherine, love! catherine!” interposed linton, greatly shocked the

“i’m far jesting, miss catherine,” replied. “you love mr.
 edgar handsome, young, cheerful, rich, and
 loves you. last, however, goes nothing: love him
 without that, probably; wouldn’t, unless possessed

“that’s strange! make out.”
 
“it’s secret. will mock me, i’ll explain it: i

 “and gate open: somewhere hearing; not

joseph objected first; much earnest, however, to
 suffer contradiction; last placed hat head, and

 catherine persuaded tranquillity. kept wandering

“what want?” asked mrs. linton.
 
“i question him,” answered.
 
“well, close curtains, nelly,” said; “and bring tea. i’ll be

“what use praising heathcliff him?” answered. “as lads they

“but show great weakness?” pursued she. “i’m envious: i

“how can say harsh, naughty fondling?” cried mistress,

“yesterday,” sobbed isabella, “and now!”
 
“yesterday!” said sister-in-law. “on occasion?”

“is sane?” asked mrs. linton, appealing me. “i’ll repeat our

“i don’t mind conversation,” answered: “i wanted with—”
 
“well?” said catherine, perceiving hesitate complete the

“with him: won’t always sent off!” continued, kindling up.
 “you dog manger, cathy, desire one loved but

“you impertinent little monkey!” exclaimed mrs. linton, in

“no, not,” said infatuated girl. “i love than

“i wouldn’t kingdom, then!” catherine declared,
 emphatically: seemed speak sincerely. “nelly, help to

miss linton regarded sister-in-law indignation.
 
“for shame! shame!” repeated, angrily. “you worse than

“ah! won’t believe me, then?” said catherine. “you think speak
 wicked selfishness?”
 
“i’m certain do,” retorted isabella; “and shudder you!”
 
“good!” cried other. “try yourself, spirit: i

“hey, throttler, lad!” whispered little wretch, rousing half-bred

love life urged compliance; stepped threshold to

“i say, wish come house!” cried, thinking

“none o’ me! getten summut else do,” answered, continued

 might show himself. short suspense, opened tall,
 gaunt man, without neckerchief, otherwise extremely slovenly; his
 features lost masses shaggy hair hung shoulders;
 _his_ eyes, too, like ghostly catherine’s their
 beauty annihilated.
 
“what’s business here?” demanded, grimly. “who you?”
 
“my name _was_ isabella linton,” replied. “you’ve seen before,
 sir. i’m lately married mr. heathcliff, brought here—i
 suppose permission.”
 
“is come back, then?” asked hermit, glaring like hungry wolf.
 
“yes—we came just now,” said; “but left kitchen door;
 gone in, little boy played sentinel the

“it’s well hellish villain kept word!” growled future

you’ll surprised, ellen, feeling particularly cheerless,
 seated worse solitude inhospitable hearth, and
 remembering four miles distant lay delightful home, containing
 people loved earth; might well the
 atlantic part us, instead four miles: overpass
 them! questioned myself—where must turn comfort? and—mind
 don’t tell edgar, catherine—above every sorrow beside, rose
 pre-eminent: despair finding nobody ally
 heathcliff! sought shelter wuthering heights, almost
 gladly, secured arrangement living alone

 fear intermeddling.
 
sat thought doleful time: clock struck eight, nine, and
 still companion paced fro, head bent breast, and
 perfectly silent, unless groan bitter ejaculation forced itself

 filled interim wild regrets dismal anticipations,
 which, last, spoke audibly irrepressible sighing weeping. i
 aware openly grieved, till earnshaw halted opposite, in
 measured walk, gave stare newly-awakened surprise.
 taking advantage recovered attention, exclaimed—“i’m tired

 direct her, won’t come me!”
 
“we none,” answered; “you must wait yourself!”
 
“where must sleep, then?” sobbed; beyond regarding
 self-respect, weighed fatigue wretchedness.
 
“joseph will show heathcliff’s chamber,” said he; “open that
 door—he’s there.”
 
going obey, suddenly arrested me, added the
 strangest tone—“be good turn lock, draw your
 bolt—don’t omit it!”
 
“well!” said. “but why, mr. earnshaw?” relish notion of
 deliberately fastening heathcliff.
 
“look here!” replied, pulling waistcoat a
 curiously-constructed pistol, double-edged spring knife
 attached barrel. “that’s great tempter desperate man, is
 not? resist going every night, trying his

surveyed weapon inquisitively. hideous notion struck me: how
 powerful possessing instrument! took his

 face assumed brief second: horror, was
 covetousness. snatched pistol back, jealously; shut knife,
 returned concealment.
 
“i don’t care tell him,” said he. “put guard, and
 watch him. know terms on, see: danger not

“what heathcliff done you?” asked. “in wronged

 quit house?”
 
“no!” thundered earnshaw; “should offer leave me, he’s dead

you’ve acquainted me, ellen, old master’s habits. is
 clearly verge madness: last night least. i
 shuddered near him, thought servant’s ill-bred
 moroseness comparatively agreeable. now recommenced moody

 bending fire, peering large pan swung it;

lamentation drew notice me: went briskly work,

“what want yours?” retorted. “i suppose mr. heathcliff does

“oh! it’s maister _hathecliff’s_ ye’re wanting?” cried he, making

soon perused epistle went master, and
 informed sister arrived heights, sent a
 letter expressing sorrow mrs. linton’s situation, her
 ardent desire see him; wish transmit her, as
 early possible, token forgiveness me.
 
“forgiveness!” said linton. “i nothing forgive her, ellen. you

“and won’t write little note, sir?” asked, imploringly.
 
“no,” answered. “it needless. communication heathcliff’s

“oh, nothing,” replied, thinking best speak truth at
 once. “my master bid tell sister must expect either

“mrs. linton now just recovering,” said; “she’ll never like she

“that quite possible,” remarked heathcliff, forcing seem

 heathcliff, scornfully. “he turns adrift world with

“he aware suffer,” replied. “i didn’t tell him

“you telling something, then: written, have

“to say married, write—you saw note.”

“no.”
 
“my young lady looking sadly worse change condition,”

mrs. linton sat loose white dress, light shawl her
 shoulders, recess open window, usual. thick, long
 hair partly removed beginning illness, now
 wore simply combed natural tresses temples and
 neck. appearance altered, told heathcliff; when
 calm, seemed unearthly beauty change. flash of
 eyes succeeded dreamy melancholy softness; they
 longer gave impression looking objects around her:
 appeared always gaze beyond, far beyond—you said
 world. then, paleness face—its haggard aspect
 vanished recovered flesh—and peculiar expression
 arising mental state, though painfully suggestive their
 causes, added touching interest awakened;
 and—invariably me, know, person saw her, should
 think—refuted tangible proofs convalescence, stamped as
 one doomed decay.
 
book lay spread sill her, scarcely perceptible
 wind fluttered leaves intervals. believe linton laid it
 there: never endeavoured divert reading, or
 occupation kind, spend many hour trying to
 entice attention subject formerly her
 amusement. conscious aim, better moods
 endured efforts placidly, showing uselessness now and
 suppressing wearied sigh, checking last the
 saddest smiles kisses. times, turn petulantly
 away, hide face hands, even push angrily; and
 took care let alone, certain no

gimmerton chapel bells still ringing; full, mellow flow of
 beck valley came soothingly ear. sweet

 drowned music grange trees leaf. at
 wuthering heights always sounded quiet days following great

“there’s letter you, mrs. linton,” said, gently inserting in
 one hand rested knee. “you must read immediately,
 wants answer. shall break seal?” “yes,” she
 answered, without altering direction eyes. opened it—it
 short. “now,” continued, “read it.” drew away hand,
 let fall. replaced lap, stood waiting till it
 please glance down; movement long delayed
 last resumed—“must read it, ma’am? mr.
 heathcliff.”
 
start troubled gleam recollection, struggle
 arrange ideas. lifted letter, seemed peruse it;
 came signature sighed: yet still found she
 gathered import, for, upon desiring hear reply,
 merely pointed name, gazed mournful and
 questioning eagerness.
 
“well, wishes see you,” said i, guessing need an
 interpreter. “he’s garden time, impatient know
 answer shall bring.”

 breathlessly. minute step traversed hall; open
 house tempting heathcliff resist walking in: likely
 supposed inclined shirk promise, resolved to
 trust audacity. straining eagerness catherine gazed
 towards entrance chamber. hit right room
 directly: motioned admit him, found ere could
 reach door, stride two side, her
 grasped arms.
 
neither spoke loosed hold five minutes, during
 period bestowed kisses ever gave life

 plainly saw hardly bear, downright agony, look
 face! conviction stricken me, the
 instant beheld her, prospect ultimate recovery
 there—she fated, sure die.
 
“oh, cathy! oh, life! can bear it?” first sentence he
 uttered, tone seek disguise despair. now
 stared earnestly thought intensity his
 gaze bring tears eyes; burned anguish:
 melt.
 
“what now?” said catherine, leaning back, returning look a
 suddenly clouded brow: humour mere vane constantly
 varying caprices. “you edgar broken heart, heathcliff! and
 come bewail deed me, people be
 pitied! shall pity you, i. killed me—and thriven on
 it, think. strong are! many years mean live

heathcliff knelt one knee embrace her; attempted rise,
 seized hair, kept down.
 
“i wish hold you,” continued, bitterly, “till both
 dead! shouldn’t care suffered. care nothing your
 sufferings. shouldn’t suffer? do! will forget me? will

 children dearer was; and, death, shall not
 rejoice going her: shall sorry must leave
 them!’ will say so, heathcliff?”
 
“don’t torture till i’m mad yourself,” cried he, wrenching his
 head free, grinding teeth.
 
two, cool spectator, made strange fearful picture. well
 might catherine deem heaven land exile her,
 unless mortal body cast away moral character also. her
 present countenance wild vindictiveness white cheek, a
 bloodless lip scintillating eye; retained closed
 fingers portion locks grasping. her
 companion, raising one hand, taken arm
 other; inadequate stock gentleness the
 requirements condition, letting go saw four
 distinct impressions left blue colourless skin.
 
“are possessed devil,” pursued, savagely, “to talk in
 manner dying? reflect those
 words will branded memory, eating deeper eternally after
 left me? know lie say killed you: and,
 catherine, know soon forget existence! is
 sufficient infernal selfishness, at
 peace shall writhe torments hell?”
 
“i shall peace,” moaned catherine, recalled sense of
 physical weakness violent, unequal throbbing heart, which
 beat visibly audibly excess agitation. said
 nothing till paroxysm over; continued, more
 kindly—
 
“i’m wishing greater torment have, heathcliff. only
 wish us never parted: word mine distress you
 hereafter, think feel distress underground, own
 sake, forgive me! come kneel again! never harmed me
 life. nay, nurse anger, will worse remember
 harsh words! won’t come again? do!”
 
heathcliff went back chair, leant over, so
 far let see face, livid emotion. bent
 round look him; permit it: turning abruptly, he
 walked fireplace, stood, silent, back towards
 us. mrs. linton’s glance followed suspiciously: every movement woke
 new sentiment her. pause prolonged gaze, she
 resumed; addressing accents indignant disappointment:—
 
“oh, see, nelly, relent moment keep the
 grave. _that_ i’m loved! well, never mind. _my_
 heathcliff. shall love mine yet; take me: he’s my
 soul. and,” added musingly, “the thing irks this
 shattered prison, all. i’m tired enclosed here. i’m
 wearying escape glorious world, always there:

 strength: sorry me—very soon will altered. shall
 sorry _you_. shall incomparably beyond all. i
 _wonder_ won’t near me!” went herself. “i thought he
 wished it. heathcliff, dear! sullen now. come to
 me, heathcliff.”
 
eagerness rose supported arm the
 chair. earnest appeal turned her, looking absolutely
 desperate. eyes, wide wet, last flashed fiercely her; his
 breast heaved convulsively. instant held asunder, how
 met hardly saw, catherine made spring, caught her,

movement catherine’s relieved little presently: put up

“you teach now cruel you’ve been—cruel false. _why_ you
 despise me? _why_ betray heart, cathy? one

 may kiss me, cry; wring kisses tears: they’ll blight

“let alone. let alone,” sobbed catherine. “if i’ve done wrong,

“it hard forgive, look eyes, feel those

silent—their faces hid other, washed each

 seemed heathcliff _could_ weep great occasion like this.
 
grew uncomfortable, meanwhile; afternoon wore fast away,
 man sent returned errand, could

 thickening outside gimmerton chapel porch.
 
“service over,” announced. “my master will half an

heathcliff groaned curse, strained catherine closer: never

ere long perceived group servants passing road
 towards kitchen wing. mr. linton far behind; opened the
 gate sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying lovely
 afternoon breathed soft summer.
 
“now here,” exclaimed. “for heaven’s sake, hurry down! you’ll
 meet one front stairs. quick; stay among the
 trees till fairly in.”
 
“i must go, cathy,” said heathcliff, seeking extricate from
 companion’s arms. “but live, i’ll see are

“you must go!” answered, holding firmly strength

“for one hour,” pleaded earnestly.
 
“not one minute,” replied.
 
“i _must_—linton will immediately,” persisted alarmed
 intruder.

 gasping: mad resolution face.
 
“no!” shrieked. “oh, don’t, don’t go. last time! edgar
 will hurt us. heathcliff, shall die! shall die!”
 
“damn fool! is,” cried heathcliff, sinking back his
 seat. “hush, darling! hush, hush, catherine! i’ll stay. shot

“are going listen ravings?” said, passionately. “she

wrung hands, cried out; mr. linton hastened step at
 noise. midst agitation, sincerely glad to
 observe catherine’s arms fallen relaxed, head hung
 down.
 
“she’s fainted, dead,” thought: “so much better. far better
 dead, lingering burden misery-maker to
 her.”
 
edgar sprang unbidden guest, blanched astonishment and
 rage. meant tell; however, stopped all
 demonstrations, once, placing lifeless-looking form his
 arms.
 
“look there!” said. “unless fiend, help first—then you
 shall speak me!”
 
walked parlour, sat down. mr. linton summoned me, and

 restore sensation; bewildered; sighed, and
 moaned, knew nobody. edgar, anxiety her, forgot her

“i shall refuse go doors,” answered; “but shall stay

“yes,” replied, “your mother’s nephew. don’t like him?”
 
catherine looked queer.
 
“is handsome lad?” continued.
 
uncivil little thing stood tiptoe, whispered sentence in

“worse,” replied, “because sullen it.”
 
“i’ve pleasure him,” continued, reflecting aloud. “he has

“get up, idle boy!” exclaimed, assumed heartiness. “away

linton gathered energies, left hearth. lattice was

 scratched head like true clown.
 
“it’s damnable writing,” answered. “i read it.”
 
“can’t read it?” cried catherine; “i can read it: it’s english. i

linton giggled: first appearance mirth exhibited.
 
“he know letters,” said cousin. “could you

“papa!” exclaimed, morning’s salutations, “guess i

“it disliked mr. heathcliff,” answered.
 
“then believe care feelings yours, cathy?”
 said. “no, disliked mr. heathcliff, because

 heathcliff seemed murderer. miss cathy—conversant bad deeds

catherine kissed father, sat quietly lessons a

“oh, fie, silly child!” exclaimed. “if real griefs you’d

“no, indeed! no, indeed!” replied decision. “then write

“but can one little note—?” recommenced, putting an

chapter xxiii
 

rainy night ushered misty morning—half frost, half
 drizzle—and temporary brooks crossed path—gurgling the
 uplands. feet thoroughly wetted; cross low; exactly
 humour suited making disagreeable things. we
 entered farm-house kitchen way, ascertain whether mr.
 heathcliff really absent: put slight faith own
 affirmation.
 
joseph seemed sitting sort elysium alone, beside roaring
 fire; quart ale table near him, bristling large pieces
 toasted oat-cake; black, short pipe mouth. catherine
 ran hearth warm herself. asked master in? my
 question remained long unanswered, thought old man had
 grown deaf, repeated louder.
 
“na—ay!” snarled, rather screamed nose. “na—ay! yah
 muh goa back whear yah coom frough.”
 
“joseph!” cried peevish voice, simultaneously me, inner

 joseph! come moment.”
 
vigorous puffs, resolute stare grate, declared no
 ear appeal. housekeeper hareton invisible; one
 gone errand, work, probably. knew
 linton’s tones, entered.
 
“oh, hope you’ll die garret, starved death!” said boy,
 mistaking approach negligent attendant.
 
stopped observing error: cousin flew him.
 
“is you, miss linton?” said, raising head arm of
 great chair, reclined. “no—don’t kiss me: takes my
 breath. dear me! papa said call,” continued he, after
 recovering little catherine’s embrace; stood by
 looking contrite. “will shut door, please? left
 open; those—those _detestable_ creatures won’t bring coals to
 fire. it’s cold!”
 
stirred cinders, fetched scuttleful myself. invalid
 complained covered ashes; tiresome cough,
 looked feverish ill, rebuke temper.
 
“well, linton,” murmured catherine, corrugated brow relaxed,
 “are glad see me? can good?”
 
“why didn’t come before?” asked. “you come, instead
 writing. tired dreadfully writing long letters. i’d far
 rather talked you. now, can neither bear talk, nor
 anything else. wonder zillah is! will you” (looking me)
 “step kitchen see?”
 
received thanks service; unwilling to
 run fro behest, replied—
 
“nobody joseph.”
 
“i want drink,” exclaimed fretfully, turning away. “zillah is
 constantly gadding gimmerton since papa went: it’s miserable!
 i’m obliged come here—they resolved never hear me
 upstairs.”
 
“is father attentive you, master heathcliff?” asked,
 perceiving catherine checked friendly advances.
 
“attentive? makes _them_ little attentive least,” he
 cried. “the wretches! know, miss linton, brute hareton
 laughs me! hate him! indeed, hate all: odious
 beings.”
 
cathy began searching water; lighted pitcher the
 dresser, filled tumbler, brought it. bid add spoonful of
 wine bottle table; swallowed small portion,
 appeared tranquil, said kind.
 
“and glad see me?” asked she, reiterating former
 question, pleased detect faint dawn smile.
 
“yes, am. it’s something new hear voice like yours!” replied.
 “but vexed, wouldn’t come. papa swore it
 owing me: called pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing;
 said despised me; place, be
 master grange father time. you
 don’t despise me, you, miss—?”
 
“i wish say catherine, cathy,” interrupted young lady.
 “despise you? no! next papa ellen, love better than
 anybody living. don’t love mr. heathcliff, though; dare not
 come returns: will stay away many days?”
 
“not many,” answered linton; “but goes moors frequently,
 since shooting season commenced; might spend hour two
 absence. say will. think be
 peevish you: you’d provoke me, you’d always ready to
 help me, wouldn’t you?”
 
“yes,” said catherine, stroking long soft hair, “if only
 get papa’s consent, i’d spend half time you. pretty linton! i
 wish brother.”
 
“and like well father?” observed he, more
 cheerfully. “but papa says love better all
 world, wife; i’d rather that.”
 
“no, never love anybody better papa,” returned
 gravely. “and people hate wives, sometimes; sisters
 brothers: latter, live us, and
 papa fond me.”
 
linton denied people ever hated wives; cathy affirmed
 did, and, wisdom, instanced father’s aversion to
 aunt. endeavoured stop thoughtless tongue. couldn’t
 succeed till everything knew out. master heathcliff, much
 irritated, asserted relation false.
 
“papa told me; papa tell falsehoods,” answered pertly.
 
“_my_ papa scorns yours!” cried linton. “he calls sneaking fool.”
 
“yours wicked man,” retorted catherine; “and naughty
 dare repeat says. must wicked made aunt
 isabella leave did.”
 
“she didn’t leave him,” said boy; “you sha’n’t contradict me.”
 
“she did,” cried young lady.
 
“well, i’ll tell _you_ something!” said linton. “your mother hated your
 father: now then.”
 
“oh!” exclaimed catherine, enraged continue.
 
“and loved mine,” added he.
 
“you little liar! hate now!” panted, face grew red
 passion.
 
“she did! did!” sang linton, sinking recess chair,
 leaning back head enjoy agitation other
 disputant, stood behind.
 
“hush, master heathcliff!” said; “that’s father’s tale, too, i
 suppose.”
 
“it isn’t: hold tongue!” answered. “she did, did,
 catherine! did, did!”
 
cathy, beside herself, gave chair violent push, caused to

summer already past prime, edgar reluctantly yielded his
 assent entreaties, catherine set first

 sunshine, sky dappled hazy threaten rain: our
 place meeting fixed guide-stone, cross-roads.
 arriving there, however, little herd-boy, despatched a
 messenger, told us that,—“maister linton wer just o’ side th’

“then master linton forgot first injunction uncle,” i
 observed: “he bid us keep grange land, at

“well, we’ll turn horses’ heads round reach him,” answered
 companion; “our excursion shall lie towards home.”
 
reached him, scarcely quarter mile from
 door, found horse; forced dismount,
 leave graze. lay heath, awaiting approach,
 rise till came within yards. walked so
 feebly, looked pale, immediately exclaimed,—“why, master
 heathcliff, fit enjoying ramble morning. ill

catherine surveyed grief astonishment: changed the
 ejaculation joy lips one alarm; congratulation
 long-postponed meeting anxious inquiry, whether were
 worse usual?
 
“no—better—better!” panted, trembling, retaining hand if
 needed support, large blue eyes wandered timidly over
 her; hollowness round transforming haggard wildness the
 languid expression possessed.
 
“but worse,” persisted cousin; “worse saw
 last; thinner, and—”
 
“i’m tired,” interrupted, hurriedly. “it hot walking, let
 us rest here. and, morning, often feel sick—papa says grow
 fast.”
 
badly satisfied, cathy sat down, reclined beside her.
 
“this something like paradise,” said she, making effort at
 cheerfulness. “you recollect two days agreed spend the
 place way thought pleasantest? nearly yours, only
 clouds; soft mellow: nicer
 sunshine. next week, can, we’ll ride grange

linton appear remember talked of; had
 evidently great difficulty sustaining kind conversation. his
 lack interest subjects started, equal incapacity
 contribute entertainment, obvious not
 conceal disappointment. indefinite alteration come his
 whole person manner. pettishness might caressed into
 fondness, yielded listless apathy; less the
 peevish temper child frets teases purpose be
 soothed, self-absorbed moroseness confirmed
 invalid, repelling consolation, ready regard good-humoured
 mirth others insult. catherine perceived, well did,

“but think,” said cathy, “you’d comfortable home than

 little taste diversions now: else, amuse
 you, i’d willingly stay.”
 
“stay rest yourself,” replied. “and, catherine, don’t think or
 say i’m _very_ unwell: heavy weather heat make
 dull; walked about, came, great deal me. tell
 uncle i’m tolerable health, will you?”
 
“i’ll tell _you_ say so, linton. couldn’t affirm you
 are,” observed young lady, wondering pertinacious assertion
 evidently untruth.
 
“and next thursday,” continued he, shunning puzzled
 gaze. “and give thanks permitting come—my best
 thanks, catherine. and—and, _did_ meet father, asked
 me, don’t lead suppose i’ve extremely silent

 angry.”
 
“i care nothing anger,” exclaimed cathy, imagining be
 object.
 
“but do,” said cousin, shuddering. “_don’t_ provoke against
 me, catherine, hard.”
 
“is severe you, master heathcliff?” inquired. “has grown
 weary indulgence, passed passive active hatred?”
 
linton looked me, answer; and, keeping seat by
 side another ten minutes, head fell drowsily on
 breast, uttered nothing except suppressed moans of
 exhaustion pain, cathy began seek solace looking for
 bilberries, sharing produce researches me: did
 offer him, saw notice weary and
 annoy.
 
“is half-an-hour now, ellen?” whispered ear, last. “i
 can’t tell stay. he’s asleep, papa will wanting us

“well, must leave asleep,” answered; “wait till wakes,
 patient. mighty eager set off, longing to
 see poor linton soon evaporated!”
 
“why _he_ wish see me?” returned catherine. “in crossest
 humours, formerly, liked better present curious
 mood. it’s just task compelled perform—this
 interview—for fear father scold him. i’m hardly going to
 come give mr. heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason may for
 ordering linton undergo penance. and, though i’m glad he’s
 better health, i’m sorry he’s much less pleasant, much
 less affectionate me.”
 
“you think _he is_ better health, then?” said.
 
“yes,” answered; “because always made great deal his
 sufferings, know. tolerably well, told tell
 papa; he’s better, likely.”
 
“there differ me, miss cathy,” remarked; “i should
 conjecture far worse.”
 
linton started slumber bewildered terror, asked if
 one called name.
 
“no,” said catherine; “unless dreams. conceive you
 manage doze doors, morning.”
 
“i thought heard father,” gasped, glancing frowning
 nab us. “you sure nobody spoke?”
 
“quite sure,” replied cousin. “only ellen disputing
 concerning health. truly stronger, linton, we
 separated winter? be, i’m certain one thing not
 stronger—your regard me: speak,—are you?”
 
tears gushed linton’s eyes answered, “yes, yes, am!”
 and, still spell imaginary voice, gaze wandered up

cathy rose. “for to-day must part,” said. “and won’t conceal
 sadly disappointed meeting; though i’ll

“hush,” murmured linton; “for god’s sake, hush! he’s coming.” he
 clung catherine’s arm, striving detain her; that
 announcement hastily disengaged herself, whistled minny, who
 obeyed like dog.
 
“i’ll next thursday,” cried, springing saddle.
 “good-bye. quick, ellen!”

 anticipating father’s approach.

 perplexed sensation pity regret, largely blended vague,
 uneasy doubts linton’s actual circumstances, physical social:

seven days glided away, every one marking course henceforth

deferred excursion till afternoon; golden afternoon of
 august: every breath hills full life, seemed
 whoever respired it, though dying, might revive. catherine’s face was
 just like landscape—shadows sunshine flitting rapid
 succession; shadows rested longer, sunshine more
 transient; poor little heart reproached even that
 passing forgetfulness cares.

 master heathcliff received us greater animation occasion:
 animation high spirits though, yet joy; looked
 like fear.
 
“it late!” said, speaking short difficulty. “is your
 father ill? thought wouldn’t come.”
 
“_why_ won’t candid?” cried catherine, swallowing greeting.
 “why say don’t want me? strange, linton,
 second time brought purpose,
 apparently distress us both, reason besides!”
 
linton shivered, glanced her, half supplicating, half ashamed;
 cousin’s patience sufficient endure enigmatical
 behaviour.
 
“my father _is_ ill,” said; “and called his
 bedside? didn’t send absolve promise, you
 wished wouldn’t keep it? come! desire explanation: playing and
 trifling completely banished mind; can’t dance

“my affectations!” murmured; “what they? heaven’s sake,
 catherine, don’t look angry! despise much please; am
 worthless, cowardly wretch: can’t scorned enough; i’m too
 mean anger. hate father, spare contempt.”
 
“nonsense!” cried catherine passion. “foolish, silly boy! and

streaming face expression agony, linton thrown his
 nerveless frame along ground: seemed convulsed exquisite
 terror.
 
“oh!” sobbed, “i bear it! catherine, catherine, i’m a
 traitor, too, dare tell you! leave me, shall be
 killed! _dear_ catherine, life hands: said
 loved me, did, wouldn’t harm you. you’ll go,
 then? kind, sweet, good catherine! perhaps _will_ consent—and
 he’ll let die you!”
 
young lady, witnessing intense anguish, stooped raise him.
 old feeling indulgent tenderness overcame vexation, she
 grew thoroughly moved alarmed.
 
“consent what?” asked. “to stay! tell meaning this
 strange talk, will. contradict words, distract
 me! calm frank, confess weighs your

“but father threatened me,” gasped boy, clasping attenuated
 fingers, “and dread him—i dread him! _dare_ tell!”
 
“oh, well!” said catherine, scornful compassion, “keep your
 secret: _i’m_ coward. save yourself: i’m afraid!”
 
magnanimity provoked tears: wept wildly, kissing her
 supporting hands, yet summon courage speak out. was
 cogitating mystery might be, determined catherine should
 never suffer benefit one else, good will; when,
 hearing rustle among ling, looked saw mr. heathcliff
 almost close upon us, descending heights. didn’t cast glance
 towards companions, though sufficiently near linton’s

 said—
 
“it something see near house, nelly. at

 “that edgar linton death-bed: perhaps exaggerate his

“no; master dying,” replied: “it true enough. sad thing it
 will us all, blessing him!”
 
“how long will last, think?” asked.
 
“i don’t know,” said.
 
“because,” continued, looking two young people, were

“lively? no—he shown greatest distress,” answered. “to see

“he shall be, day two,” muttered heathcliff. “but first—get up,
 linton! get up!” shouted. “don’t grovel ground there: up,
 moment!”
 
linton sunk prostrate another paroxysm helpless fear,
 caused father’s glance towards him, suppose: nothing
 else produce humiliation. made several efforts obey, but
 little strength annihilated time, fell back

“now,” said he, curbed ferocity, “i’m getting angry—and you
 don’t command paltry spirit yours—_damn_ you! get directly!”
 
“i will, father,” panted. “only, let alone, shall faint.
 i’ve done wished, i’m sure. catherine will tell i—that

“linton dear!” whispered catherine, “i can’t go wuthering heights:

“i can never re-enter house,” answered. “i’m _not_ re-enter

“stop!” cried father. “we’ll respect catherine’s filial scruples.

“you’ll well,” replied i. “but must remain mistress: to

 perceiving us confounded, rose, expeditiously made tea

“take her, pitiful changeling!” exclaimed. “_you_ marry?

“the first thing mrs. linton did,” said, “on arrival the

 entered house, asked quiver doctor might be

“‘we know that!’ answered heathcliff; ‘but life worth a

“‘but tell do,’ said; ‘and nobody will help me,

“‘walk room,’ cried master, ‘and let never hear a

“then began bother me, said i’d enough plague the

“i delivered catherine’s message. cursed himself, few

 followed. mrs. heathcliff seated bedside, hands

“‘now—catherine,’ said, ‘how feel?’
 
“she dumb.
 
“‘how feel, catherine?’ repeated.
 
“‘he’s safe, i’m free,’ answered: ‘i feel well—but,’ she

“and looked like it, too! gave little wine. hareton and

 afterwards made joseph remove body chamber, told to

“in morning, sent tell must come to

 replied,—‘well, let till funeral; go now and

cathy stayed upstairs fortnight, according zillah; visited her
 twice day, rather friendly, attempts

“she seem amiable,” thought, “as mrs. dean persuade

“a letter old acquaintance, housekeeper grange,” i
 answered; annoyed exposing kind deed, fearful lest it

 thereat, catherine silently turned face us, and, very
 stealthily, drew pocket-handkerchief applied her

 put questions concerning inmates, rational and
 irrational, former home; gazing towards hills, murmured
 soliloquy:
 
“i like riding minny there! like be

“mrs. heathcliff,” said, sitting time mute, “you not

appeared wonder speech, asked,—
 
“does ellen like you?”
 
“yes, well,” replied, hesitatingly.
 
“you must tell her,” continued, “that answer letter,

“no books!” exclaimed. “how contrive live without

“i always reading, them,” said catherine; “and mr.

“and wants sink dunce, meantime,” answered catherine.

 observed,—“but, mrs. heathcliff, commencement, and

“oh!” replied, “i don’t wish limit acquirements: still, he

“you’d _better_ hold tongue, now,” answered fiercely.
 
agitation precluded speech; advanced hastily the

catherine reappeared, bearing tray knives forks.
 
“you may get dinner joseph,” muttered heathcliff, aside, “and

 obliged seek kitchen also, master wanted the

 approach, quietly joined occupations, shunned remarking or
 addressing him—and though always sullen silent as
 possible—after while, changed behaviour, became incapable
 letting alone: talking him; commenting stupidity and
 idleness; expressing wonder endure life he
 lived—how sit whole evening staring fire, and

“he’s just like dog, not, ellen?” observed, “or a

“i shall naught wi’ mucky pride, your

“it hate you, hate me!” wept cathy, no

 does, more.”
 
“you’re damned liar,” began earnshaw: “why made angry, by

“say forgive me, hareton, do. can make happy speaking

“and you’ll friend?” added catherine, interrogatively.
 
“nay, you’ll ashamed every day life,” answered;
 “and ashamed, know me; bide it.”
 
“so won’t friend?” said, smiling sweet honey, and
 creeping close up.

“i’ve pulled two three bushes,” replied young man; “but i’m

“and pulled up?” said master.

“we wanted plant flowers there,” cried. “i’m only

“and devil gave _you_ leave touch stick place?”

“your land, insolent slut! never any,” said heathcliff.
 
“and money,” continued; returning angry glare, meantime

 spring fragrance around, beautiful soft blue overhead, my
 young lady, run near gate procure primrose
 roots border, returned half laden, informed us mr.
 heathcliff coming in. “and spoke me,” added, a
 perplexed countenance.
 
“what say?” asked hareton.
 
“he told begone fast could,” answered. “but looked
 different usual look stopped moment stare at
 him.”
 
“how?” inquired.
 
“why, almost bright cheerful. no, _almost_ nothing—_very much_
 excited, wild, glad!” replied.
 
“night-walking amuses him, then,” remarked, affecting careless
 manner: reality surprised was, anxious ascertain
 truth statement; see master looking glad would
 every-day spectacle. framed excuse go in. heathcliff
 stood open door; pale, trembled: yet, certainly,
 strange joyful glitter eyes, altered aspect of
 whole face.
 
“will breakfast?” said. “you must hungry, rambling
 night!” wanted discover been, not
 like ask directly.
 
“no, i’m hungry,” answered, averting head, speaking
 rather contemptuously, guessed trying divine the
 occasion good humour.
 
felt perplexed: didn’t know whether proper
 opportunity offer bit admonition.
 
“i don’t think right wander doors,” observed, “instead
 bed: wise, rate moist season. i
 daresay you’ll catch bad cold, fever: something the
 matter now!”
 
“nothing can bear,” replied; “and greatest
 pleasure, provided you’ll leave alone: get in, don’t annoy me.”
 
obeyed: and, passing, noticed breathed fast cat.
 
“yes!” reflected myself, “we shall fit illness. cannot
 conceive doing.”
 
noon sat dinner us, received heaped-up plate
 hands, intended make amends previous fasting.
 
“i’ve neither cold fever, nelly,” remarked, allusion my
 morning’s speech; “and i’m ready justice food give
 me.”
 
took knife fork, going commence eating, the
 inclination appeared become suddenly extinct. laid the
 table, looked eagerly towards window, rose went out. we
 saw walking fro garden concluded meal,
 earnshaw said he’d go ask dine: thought we
 grieved way.
 
“well, coming?” cried catherine, cousin returned.
 
“nay,” answered; “but he’s angry: seemed rarely pleased
 indeed; made impatient speaking twice; he
 bid you: wondered want company of
 anybody else.”
 
set plate keep warm fender; hour two he
 re-entered, room clear, degree calmer: same
 unnatural—it unnatural—appearance joy black brows; the
 bloodless hue, teeth visible, now then, kind of
 smile; frame shivering, one shivers chill weakness,
 tight-stretched cord vibrates—a strong thrilling, rather than
 trembling.
 
will ask matter, thought; should? i
 exclaimed—“have heard good news, mr. heathcliff? look
 uncommonly animated.”
 
“where good news come me?” said. “i’m animated with
 hunger; and, seemingly, must eat.”
 
“your dinner here,” returned; “why won’t get it?”
 
“i don’t want now,” muttered, hastily: “i’ll wait till supper.
 and, nelly, all, let beg warn hareton other
 away me. wish troubled nobody: wish this
 place myself.”
 
“is new reason banishment?” inquired. “tell me
 queer, mr. heathcliff? last night? i’m
 putting question idle curiosity, but—”
 
“you putting question idle curiosity,” he
 interrupted, laugh. “yet i’ll answer it. last night the
 threshold hell. to-day, within sight heaven. my
 eyes it: hardly three feet sever me! now you’d better go!
 you’ll neither see hear anything frighten you, refrain
 prying.”
 
swept hearth wiped table, departed; perplexed
 ever.
 
quit house afternoon, one intruded on
 solitude; till, eight o’clock, deemed proper, though
 unsummoned, carry candle supper him. leaning
 ledge open lattice, looking out: face was
 turned interior gloom. fire smouldered ashes; the
 room filled damp, mild air cloudy evening; so
 still, murmur beck gimmerton was
 distinguishable, ripples gurgling pebbles, or
 large stones cover. uttered an
 ejaculation discontent seeing dismal grate, commenced
 shutting casements, one another, till came his.
 
“must close this?” asked, order rouse him; not
 stir.
 
light flashed features spoke. oh, mr. lockwood, i
 express terrible start got momentary view! those
 deep black eyes! smile, ghastly paleness! appeared me,
 mr. heathcliff, goblin; and, terror, let candle
 bend towards wall, left darkness.
 
“yes, close it,” replied, familiar voice. “there, is
 pure awkwardness! hold candle horizontally? quick,
 bring another.”
 
hurried foolish state dread, said joseph—“the
 master wishes take light rekindle fire.” i
 dared go just then.
 
joseph rattled fire shovel, went: brought it
 back immediately, supper-tray hand, explaining
 mr. heathcliff going bed, wanted nothing eat till
 morning. heard mount stairs directly; proceed to
 ordinary chamber, turned panelled bed: its
 window, mentioned before, wide enough anybody get
 through; struck plotted another midnight excursion,
 rather suspicion.
 
“is ghoul vampire?” mused. read hideous
 incarnate demons. set reflect tended him
 infancy, watched grow youth, followed almost
 whole course; absurd nonsense yield to
 sense horror. “but come from, little dark
 thing, harboured good man bane?” muttered superstition, as
 dozed unconsciousness. began, half dreaming, weary
 imagining fit parentage him; and, repeating my
 waking meditations, tracked existence again, grim
 variations; last, picturing death funeral: which, i
 can remember is, exceedingly vexed task of
 dictating inscription monument, consulting sexton
 it; and, surname, tell age, we
 obliged content single word, “heathcliff.”
 came true: were. enter kirkyard, you’ll read, his
 headstone, that, date death.
 
dawn restored common sense. rose, went garden, as
 soon see, ascertain footmarks his
 window. none. “he stayed home,” thought, “and he’ll
 right to-day.” prepared breakfast household, my
 usual custom, told hareton catherine get ere the
 master came down, lay late. preferred taking of
 doors, trees, set little table accommodate them.
 
re-entrance, found mr. heathcliff below. joseph were
 conversing farming business; gave clear, minute
 directions concerning matter discussed, spoke rapidly, and
 turned head continually aside, excited expression,
 even exaggerated. joseph quitted room took seat in
 place generally chose, put basin coffee him.
 drew nearer, rested arms table, looked at
 opposite wall, supposed, surveying one particular portion, up
 down, glittering, restless eyes, eager interest
 stopped breathing half minute together.
 
“come now,” exclaimed, pushing bread hand, “eat and
 drink that, hot: waiting near hour.”
 
didn’t notice me, yet smiled. i’d rather seen gnash
 teeth smile so.
 
“mr. heathcliff! master!” cried, “don’t, god’s sake, stare if
 saw unearthly vision.”
 
“don’t, god’s sake, shout loud,” replied. “turn round, and
 tell me, ourselves?”
 
“of course,” answer; “of course are.”
 
still, involuntarily obeyed him, quite sure. a
 sweep hand cleared vacant space front among the
 breakfast things, leant forward gaze ease.
 
now, perceived looking wall; regarded
 alone, seemed exactly gazed something within two
 yards’ distance. whatever was, communicated, apparently, both
 pleasure pain exquisite extremes: least anguished, yet
 raptured, expression countenance suggested idea. the
 fancied object fixed, either: eyes pursued with
 unwearied diligence, and, even speaking me, never weaned
 away. vainly reminded protracted abstinence food: if
 stirred touch anything compliance entreaties, he
 stretched hand get piece bread, fingers clenched
 reached it, remained table, forgetful their
 aim.
 
sat, model patience, trying attract absorbed attention
 engrossing speculation; till grew irritable, got up,
 asking allow time taking his
 meals? saying next occasion needn’t wait: might set
 things go. uttered words left house,
 slowly sauntered garden path, disappeared the
 gate.
 
hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. retire to
 rest till late, did, sleep. returned after
 midnight, and, instead going bed, shut room
 beneath. listened, tossed about, and, finally, dressed and
 descended. irksome lie there, harassing brain a
 hundred idle misgivings.
 
distinguished mr. heathcliff’s step, restlessly measuring floor,
 frequently broke silence deep inspiration, resembling a
 groan. muttered detached words also; one catch was
 name catherine, coupled wild term endearment or
 suffering; spoken one speak person present; low and
 earnest, wrung depth soul. courage to
 walk straight apartment; desired divert his
 reverie, therefore fell foul kitchen fire, stirred it, and
 began scrape cinders. drew forth sooner expected.
 opened door immediately, said—“nelly, come here—is it
 morning? come light.”
 
“it striking four,” answered. “you want candle take upstairs:
 might lit one fire.”
 
“no, don’t wish go upstairs,” said. “come in, kindle _me_ a
 fire, anything room.”
 
“i must blow coals red first, can carry any,” replied,
 getting chair bellows.
 
roamed fro, meantime, state approaching distraction; his
 heavy sighs succeeding thick leave space for
 common breathing between.
 
“when day breaks i’ll send green,” said; “i wish make some
 legal inquiries can bestow thought matters,
 can act calmly. written will yet; to
 leave property determine. wish annihilate from
 face earth.”
 
“i talk so, mr. heathcliff,” interposed. “let will be
 while: you’ll spared repent many injustices yet! i
 never expected nerves disordered: are, at
 present, marvellously so, however; almost entirely own
 fault. way you’ve passed three last days might knock a
 titan. take food, repose. need look at
 glass see require both. cheeks are
 hollow, eyes blood-shot, like person starving hunger
 going blind loss sleep.”
 
“it fault eat rest,” replied. “i assure
 settled designs. i’ll both, soon i
 possibly can. might well bid man struggling water
 rest within arms’ length shore! must reach first, then
 i’ll rest. well, never mind mr. green: repenting my
 injustices, i’ve done injustice, repent nothing. i’m too
 happy; yet i’m happy enough. soul’s bliss kills body, but
 satisfy itself.”
 
“happy, master?” cried. “strange happiness! hear me
 without angry, might offer advice make you
 happier.”
 
“what that?” asked. “give it.”
 
“you aware, mr. heathcliff,” said, “that time were
 thirteen years old lived selfish, unchristian life; and
 probably hardly bible hands period. you
 must forgotten contents book, may have
 space search now. hurtful send one—some
 minister denomination, matter which—to explain it,
 show far erred precepts; how
 unfit will heaven, unless change takes place before
 die?”
 
“i’m rather obliged angry, nelly,” said, “for remind of
 manner desire buried. carried the
 churchyard evening. hareton may, please,
 accompany me: mind, particularly, notice sexton obeys
 directions concerning two coffins! minister need come; nor
 need anything said me.—i tell nearly attained _my_
 heaven; others altogether unvalued uncoveted me.”
 
“and supposing persevered obstinate fast, died that
 means, refused bury precincts kirk?” i
 said, shocked godless indifference. “how like it?”
 
“they won’t that,” replied: “if did, must me
 removed secretly; neglect shall prove, practically,
 dead annihilated!”
 
soon heard members family stirring retired
 den, breathed freer. afternoon, joseph
 hareton work, came kitchen again, and,
 wild look, bid come sit house: wanted somebody
 him. declined; telling plainly strange talk and
 manner frightened me, neither nerve will be
 companion alone.
 
“i believe think fiend,” said, dismal laugh:
 “something horrible live decent roof.” turning to
 catherine, there, drew behind approach, he
 added, half sneeringly,—“will _you_ come, chuck? i’ll hurt you. no!
 i’ve made worse devil. well, _one_ who
 won’t shrink company! god! she’s relentless. oh, damn it!
 it’s unutterably much flesh blood bear—even mine.”
 
solicited society one more. dusk went his
 chamber. whole night, far morning, heard
 groaning murmuring himself. hareton anxious enter;
 bid fetch mr. kenneth, go see him. when
 came, requested admittance tried open door, found
 locked; heathcliff bid us damned. better, be
 left alone; doctor went away.
 
following evening wet: indeed, poured till
 day-dawn; and, took morning walk round house, observed
 master’s window swinging open, rain driving straight in. he
 bed, thought: showers drench through. he
 must either out. i’ll make ado, i’ll go boldly and
 look.
 
succeeded obtaining entrance another key, ran to
 unclose panels, chamber vacant; quickly pushing them
 aside, peeped in. mr. heathcliff there—laid back. eyes
 met mine keen fierce, started; seemed smile. i
 think dead: face throat washed with
 rain; bed-clothes dripped, perfectly still. lattice,
 flapping fro, grazed one hand rested sill; no
 blood trickled broken skin, put fingers it, i
 doubt more: dead stark!
 
hasped window; combed black long hair forehead; i
 tried close eyes: extinguish, possible, frightful,
 life-like gaze exultation one else beheld it. would
 shut: seemed sneer attempts; parted lips and
 sharp white teeth sneered too! taken another fit cowardice, i
 cried joseph. joseph shuffled made noise, but
 resolutely refused meddle him.
 
“th’ divil’s harried soul,” cried, “and may hev’ his
 carcass t’ bargin, aught care! ech! wicked ’un he
 looks, girning death!” old sinner grinned mockery. i
 thought intended cut caper round bed; suddenly
 composing himself, fell knees, raised hands, and
 returned thanks lawful master ancient stock were
 restored rights.
 
felt stunned awful event; memory unavoidably recurred
 former times sort oppressive sadness. poor hareton,
 wronged, one really suffered much. sat by
 corpse night, weeping bitter earnest. pressed hand,
 kissed sarcastic, savage face every one else shrank from
 contemplating; bemoaned strong grief springs
 naturally generous heart, though tough tempered steel.
 
mr. kenneth perplexed pronounce disorder master
 died. concealed fact swallowed nothing four
 days, fearing might lead trouble, then, persuaded, he
 abstain purpose: consequence strange
 illness, cause.
 
buried him, scandal whole neighbourhood, wished.
 earnshaw i, sexton, six men carry coffin,
 comprehended whole attendance. six men departed had
 let grave: stayed see covered. hareton, with
 streaming face, dug green sods, laid brown mould
 himself: present smooth verdant companion
 mounds—and hope tenant sleeps soundly. country folks,
 ask them, swear bible _walks_: are
 speak met near church, moor, and
 even within house. idle tales, you’ll say, say i. yet that
 old man kitchen fire affirms seen two ’em looking out
 chamber window every rainy night since death:—and odd
 thing happened month ago. going grange one
 evening—a dark evening, threatening thunder—and, just turn of
 heights, encountered little boy sheep two lambs
 him; crying terribly; supposed lambs were
 skittish, guided.
 
“what matter, little man?” asked.
 
“there’s heathcliff woman yonder, t’ nab,” blubbered,
 “un’ darnut pass ’em.”
 
saw nothing; neither sheep go on, bid him
 take road lower down. probably raised phantoms from
 thinking, traversed moors alone, nonsense heard
 parents companions repeat. yet, still, don’t like out
 dark now; don’t like left grim
 house: help it; shall glad leave it, shift
 grange.
 
“they going grange, then?” said.
 
“yes,” answered mrs. dean, “as soon married, will
 new year’s day.”
 
“and will live then?”
 
“why, joseph will take care house, and, perhaps, lad keep
 company. will live kitchen, rest will shut
 up.”
 
“for use ghosts choose inhabit it?” observed.
 
“no, mr. lockwood,” said nelly, shaking head. “i believe dead

moment garden gate swung to; ramblers returning.
 
“_they_ afraid nothing,” grumbled, watching approach

stepped door-stones, halted take last look

 irresistibly impelled escape again; and, pressing remembrance

 seven months: many window showed black gaps deprived glass; and
 slates jutted off, there, beyond right line roof,

sought, soon discovered, three headstones slope next

 mother nursed mr. hindley earnshaw, hareton’s father, and
 got used playing children: ran errands too, helped
 make hay, hung farm ready anything anybody

 harvest, remember—mr. earnshaw, old master, came downstairs,
 dressed journey; and, told joseph be

 eating porridge them—and said, speaking son, “now, my
 bonny man, i’m going liverpool to-day, shall bring you? you

 sometimes. promised bring pocketful apples pears, and
 kissed children, said good-bye, set off.

“and end flighted death!” said, opening his

crowded round, miss cathy’s head peep dirty,
 ragged, black-haired child; big enough walk talk: indeed,
 face looked older catherine’s; yet set its

 conclusion was, mistress grumbled calm; mr.

 stand hindley’s blows without winking shedding tear, and
 pinches moved draw breath open eyes, if

 endurance made old earnshaw furious, discovered son
 persecuting poor fatherless child, called him. took to
 heathcliff strangely, believing said (for matter, said
 precious little, generally truth), petting far above
 cathy, mischievous wayward favourite.
 
so, beginning, bred bad feeling house; at

 young master learned regard father oppressor rather

 standing still, “and i’ll tell boasted turn

 fell, staggered immediately, breathless white; and,
 prevented it, gone just master, and
 got full revenge letting condition plead him, intimating who
 caused it. “take colt, gipsy, then!” said young earnshaw. “and i
 pray may break neck: take him, damned, beggarly

heathcliff gone loose beast, shift stall;

“i’m far jesting, miss catherine,” replied. “you love mr.

“what want?” asked mrs. linton.
 
“i question him,” answered.
 
“well, close curtains, nelly,” said; “and bring tea. i’ll be

took post urn; miss isabella came, summoned by

 neither eat drink. edgar made slop saucer,
 scarcely swallowed mouthful. guest protract his

“what use praising heathcliff him?” answered. “as lads they

“but show great weakness?” pursued she. “i’m envious: i

 abjured peevishness (though spirits seemed still subdued by
 catherine’s exuberance vivacity), ventured objection to
 taking isabella wuthering heights afternoon; and
 rewarded summer sweetness affection in

 servants profiting perpetual sunshine.

“how can say harsh, naughty fondling?” cried mistress,

“yesterday,” sobbed isabella, “and now!”
 
“yesterday!” said sister-in-law. “on occasion?”
 
“in walk along moor: told ramble pleased,

“and that’s notion harshness?” said catherine, laughing. “it

“oh, no,” wept young lady; “you wished away, knew i

“is sane?” asked mrs. linton, appealing me. “i’ll repeat our
 conversation, word word, isabella; point charm it

“i don’t mind conversation,” answered: “i wanted with—”
 
“well?” said catherine, perceiving hesitate complete the

“with him: won’t always sent off!” continued, kindling up.
 “you dog manger, cathy, desire one loved but

“you impertinent little monkey!” exclaimed mrs. linton, in

“no, not,” said infatuated girl. “i love than

“i wouldn’t kingdom, then!” catherine declared,
 emphatically: seemed speak sincerely. “nelly, help to

miss linton regarded sister-in-law indignation.
 
“for shame! shame!” repeated, angrily. “you worse than

“ah! won’t believe me, then?” said catherine. “you think speak
 wicked selfishness?”
 
“i’m certain do,” retorted isabella; “and shudder you!”
 
“good!” cried other. “try yourself, spirit: i

“oh, dear! thought home,” sighed. “i thought lying

love life urged compliance; stepped threshold to

“i say, wish come house!” cried, thinking

“none o’ me! getten summut else do,” answered, continued

 might show himself. short suspense, opened tall,
 gaunt man, without neckerchief, otherwise extremely slovenly; his
 features lost masses shaggy hair hung shoulders;
 _his_ eyes, too, like ghostly catherine’s their
 beauty annihilated.
 
“what’s business here?” demanded, grimly. “who you?”
 
“my name _was_ isabella linton,” replied. “you’ve seen before,
 sir. i’m lately married mr. heathcliff, brought here—i
 suppose permission.”
 
“is come back, then?” asked hermit, glaring like hungry wolf.
 
“yes—we came just now,” said; “but left kitchen door;
 gone in, little boy played sentinel the

“it’s well hellish villain kept word!” growled future

you’ll surprised, ellen, feeling particularly cheerless,

 remembering four miles distant lay delightful home, containing
 people loved earth; might well the
 atlantic part us, instead four miles: overpass

 don’t tell edgar, catherine—above every sorrow beside, rose
 pre-eminent: despair finding nobody ally
 heathcliff! sought shelter wuthering heights, almost
 gladly, secured arrangement living alone

 fear intermeddling.
 
sat thought doleful time: clock struck eight, nine, and
 still companion paced fro, head bent breast, and
 perfectly silent, unless groan bitter ejaculation forced itself

 filled interim wild regrets dismal anticipations,
 which, last, spoke audibly irrepressible sighing weeping. i

 measured walk, gave stare newly-awakened surprise.
 taking advantage recovered attention, exclaimed—“i’m tired

 direct her, won’t come me!”
 
“we none,” answered; “you must wait yourself!”
 
“where must sleep, then?” sobbed; beyond regarding
 self-respect, weighed fatigue wretchedness.
 
“joseph will show heathcliff’s chamber,” said he; “open that
 door—he’s there.”
 
going obey, suddenly arrested me, added the
 strangest tone—“be good turn lock, draw your
 bolt—don’t omit it!”
 
“well!” said. “but why, mr. earnshaw?” relish notion of
 deliberately fastening heathcliff.
 
“look here!” replied, pulling waistcoat a
 curiously-constructed pistol, double-edged spring knife
 attached barrel. “that’s great tempter desperate man, is
 not? resist going every night, trying his

surveyed weapon inquisitively. hideous notion struck me: how
 powerful possessing instrument! took his

 returned concealment.
 
“i don’t care tell him,” said he. “put guard, and
 watch him. know terms on, see: danger not

“what heathcliff done you?” asked. “in wronged

 quit house?”
 
“no!” thundered earnshaw; “should offer leave me, he’s dead

you’ve acquainted me, ellen, old master’s habits. is
 clearly verge madness: last night least. i
 shuddered near him, thought servant’s ill-bred

 bending fire, peering large pan swung it;

lamentation drew notice me: went briskly work,

“what want yours?” retorted. “i suppose mr. heathcliff does

“oh! it’s maister _hathecliff’s_ ye’re wanting?” cried he, making

 early possible, token forgiveness me.
 
“forgiveness!” said linton. “i nothing forgive her, ellen. you

“and won’t write little note, sir?” asked, imploringly.
 
“no,” answered. “it needless. communication heathcliff’s

“oh, nothing,” replied, thinking best speak truth at
 once. “my master bid tell sister must expect either

“mrs. linton now just recovering,” said; “she’ll never like she

“to say married, write—you saw note.”

“my young lady looking sadly worse change condition,”

mrs. linton sat loose white dress, light shawl her
 shoulders, recess open window, usual. thick, long
 hair partly removed beginning illness, now
 wore simply combed natural tresses temples and
 neck. appearance altered, told heathcliff; when
 calm, seemed unearthly beauty change. flash of
 eyes succeeded dreamy melancholy softness; they
 longer gave impression looking objects around her:
 appeared always gaze beyond, far beyond—you said
 world. then, paleness face—its haggard aspect
 vanished recovered flesh—and peculiar expression
 arising mental state, though painfully suggestive their
 causes, added touching interest awakened;
 and—invariably me, know, person saw her, should
 think—refuted tangible proofs convalescence, stamped as
 one doomed decay.
 
book lay spread sill her, scarcely perceptible
 wind fluttered leaves intervals. believe linton laid it
 there: never endeavoured divert reading, or
 occupation kind, spend many hour trying to
 entice attention subject formerly her
 amusement. conscious aim, better moods
 endured efforts placidly, showing uselessness now and
 suppressing wearied sigh, checking last the
 saddest smiles kisses. times, turn petulantly
 away, hide face hands, even push angrily; and
 took care let alone, certain no

gimmerton chapel bells still ringing; full, mellow flow of
 beck valley came soothingly ear. sweet
 substitute yet absent murmur summer foliage, which
 drowned music grange trees leaf. at
 wuthering heights always sounded quiet days following great

“there’s letter you, mrs. linton,” said, gently inserting in
 one hand rested knee. “you must read immediately,
 wants answer. shall break seal?” “yes,” she
 answered, without altering direction eyes. opened it—it
 short. “now,” continued, “read it.” drew away hand,
 let fall. replaced lap, stood waiting till it
 please glance down; movement long delayed
 last resumed—“must read it, ma’am? mr.
 heathcliff.”
 
start troubled gleam recollection, struggle
 arrange ideas. lifted letter, seemed peruse it;
 came signature sighed: yet still found she
 gathered import, for, upon desiring hear reply,
 merely pointed name, gazed mournful and
 questioning eagerness.
 
“well, wishes see you,” said i, guessing need an
 interpreter. “he’s garden time, impatient know
 answer shall bring.”

 breathlessly. minute step traversed hall; open
 house tempting heathcliff resist walking in: likely
 supposed inclined shirk promise, resolved to
 trust audacity. straining eagerness catherine gazed
 towards entrance chamber. hit right room
 directly: motioned admit him, found ere could

neither spoke loosed hold five minutes, during

 instant beheld her, prospect ultimate recovery
 there—she fated, sure die.
 
“oh, cathy! oh, life! can bear it?” first sentence he
 uttered, tone seek disguise despair. now
 stared earnestly thought intensity his
 gaze bring tears eyes; burned anguish:
 melt.
 
“what now?” said catherine, leaning back, returning look a
 suddenly clouded brow: humour mere vane constantly
 varying caprices. “you edgar broken heart, heathcliff! and
 come bewail deed me, people be
 pitied! shall pity you, i. killed me—and thriven on
 it, think. strong are! many years mean live

heathcliff knelt one knee embrace her; attempted rise,
 seized hair, kept down.
 
“i wish hold you,” continued, bitterly, “till both
 dead! shouldn’t care suffered. care nothing your
 sufferings. shouldn’t suffer? do! will forget me? will

 children dearer was; and, death, shall not
 rejoice going her: shall sorry must leave
 them!’ will say so, heathcliff?”
 
“don’t torture till i’m mad yourself,” cried he, wrenching his
 head free, grinding teeth.
 
two, cool spectator, made strange fearful picture. well
 might catherine deem heaven land exile her,
 unless mortal body cast away moral character also. her
 present countenance wild vindictiveness white cheek, a
 bloodless lip scintillating eye; retained closed
 fingers portion locks grasping. her
 companion, raising one hand, taken arm
 other; inadequate stock gentleness the
 requirements condition, letting go saw four
 distinct impressions left blue colourless skin.
 
“are possessed devil,” pursued, savagely, “to talk in
 manner dying? reflect those
 words will branded memory, eating deeper eternally after
 left me? know lie say killed you: and,
 catherine, know soon forget existence! is
 sufficient infernal selfishness, at
 peace shall writhe torments hell?”
 
“i shall peace,” moaned catherine, recalled sense of
 physical weakness violent, unequal throbbing heart, which
 beat visibly audibly excess agitation. said
 nothing till paroxysm over; continued, more
 kindly—
 
“i’m wishing greater torment have, heathcliff. only
 wish us never parted: word mine distress you
 hereafter, think feel distress underground, own
 sake, forgive me! come kneel again! never harmed me
 life. nay, nurse anger, will worse remember
 harsh words! won’t come again? do!”
 
heathcliff went back chair, leant over, so
 far let see face, livid emotion. bent
 round look him; permit it: turning abruptly, he
 walked fireplace, stood, silent, back towards
 us. mrs. linton’s glance followed suspiciously: every movement woke
 new sentiment her. pause prolonged gaze, she
 resumed; addressing accents indignant disappointment:—
 
“oh, see, nelly, relent moment keep the
 grave. _that_ i’m loved! well, never mind. _my_
 heathcliff. shall love mine yet; take me: he’s my
 soul. and,” added musingly, “the thing irks this
 shattered prison, all. i’m tired enclosed here. i’m
 wearying escape glorious world, always there:

 sorry _you_. shall incomparably beyond all. i
 _wonder_ won’t near me!” went herself. “i thought he
 wished it. heathcliff, dear! sullen now. come to

eagerness rose supported arm the
 chair. earnest appeal turned her, looking absolutely
 desperate. eyes, wide wet, last flashed fiercely her; his
 breast heaved convulsively. instant held asunder, how
 met hardly saw, catherine made spring, caught her,

movement catherine’s relieved little presently: put up

“you teach now cruel you’ve been—cruel false. _why_ you
 despise me? _why_ betray heart, cathy? one

“let alone. let alone,” sobbed catherine. “if i’ve done wrong,

“it hard forgive, look eyes, feel those

silent—their faces hid other, washed each

 seemed heathcliff _could_ weep great occasion like this.
 
grew uncomfortable, meanwhile; afternoon wore fast away,
 man sent returned errand, could

 thickening outside gimmerton chapel porch.
 
“service over,” announced. “my master will half an

heathcliff groaned curse, strained catherine closer: never

ere long perceived group servants passing road
 towards kitchen wing. mr. linton far behind; opened the
 gate sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying lovely
 afternoon breathed soft summer.
 
“now here,” exclaimed. “for heaven’s sake, hurry down! you’ll
 meet one front stairs. quick; stay among the

“i must go, cathy,” said heathcliff, seeking extricate from
 companion’s arms. “but live, i’ll see are

“you must go!” answered, holding firmly strength

“for one hour,” pleaded earnestly.
 
“not one minute,” replied.
 
“i _must_—linton will immediately,” persisted alarmed
 intruder.

 gasping: mad resolution face.
 
“no!” shrieked. “oh, don’t, don’t go. last time! edgar
 will hurt us. heathcliff, shall die! shall die!”
 
“damn fool! is,” cried heathcliff, sinking back his
 seat. “hush, darling! hush, hush, catherine! i’ll stay. shot

“are going listen ravings?” said, passionately. “she

wrung hands, cried out; mr. linton hastened step at

 observe catherine’s arms fallen relaxed, head hung
 down.
 
“she’s fainted, dead,” thought: “so much better. far better
 dead, lingering burden misery-maker to
 her.”
 
edgar sprang unbidden guest, blanched astonishment and
 rage. meant tell; however, stopped all
 demonstrations, once, placing lifeless-looking form his
 arms.
 
“look there!” said. “unless fiend, help first—then you
 shall speak me!”
 
walked parlour, sat down. mr. linton summoned me, and

“worse,” replied, “because sullen it.”

“it’s damnable writing,” answered. “i read it.”
 
“can’t read it?” cried catherine; “i can read it: it’s english. i

linton giggled: first appearance mirth exhibited.
 
“he know letters,” said cousin. “could you

“there’s nothing matter laziness; there, earnshaw?” said.
 “my cousin fancies idiot. experience the

“papa!” exclaimed, morning’s salutations, “guess i

“it disliked mr. heathcliff,” answered.
 
“then believe care feelings yours, cathy?”
 said. “no, disliked mr. heathcliff, because

“oh, fie, silly child!” exclaimed. “if real griefs you’d

“no, indeed! no, indeed!” replied decision. “then write

“but can one little note—?” recommenced, putting an

chapter xxiii
 

rainy night ushered misty morning—half frost, half
 drizzle—and temporary brooks crossed path—gurgling the
 uplands. feet thoroughly wetted; cross low; exactly
 humour suited making disagreeable things. we
 entered farm-house kitchen way, ascertain whether mr.
 heathcliff really absent: put slight faith own
 affirmation.
 
joseph seemed sitting sort elysium alone, beside roaring
 fire; quart ale table near him, bristling large pieces
 toasted oat-cake; black, short pipe mouth. catherine
 ran hearth warm herself. asked master in? my
 question remained long unanswered, thought old man had
 grown deaf, repeated louder.
 
“na—ay!” snarled, rather screamed nose. “na—ay! yah

“joseph!” cried peevish voice, simultaneously me, inner

 joseph! come moment.”
 
vigorous puffs, resolute stare grate, declared no

 gone errand, work, probably. knew
 linton’s tones, entered.
 
“oh, hope you’ll die garret, starved death!” said boy,
 mistaking approach negligent attendant.
 
stopped observing error: cousin flew him.
 
“is you, miss linton?” said, raising head arm of
 great chair, reclined. “no—don’t kiss me: takes my
 breath. dear me! papa said call,” continued he, after
 recovering little catherine’s embrace; stood by
 looking contrite. “will shut door, please? left
 open; those—those _detestable_ creatures won’t bring coals to
 fire. it’s cold!”
 
stirred cinders, fetched scuttleful myself. invalid
 complained covered ashes; tiresome cough,
 looked feverish ill, rebuke temper.
 
“well, linton,” murmured catherine, corrugated brow relaxed,
 “are glad see me? can good?”
 
“why didn’t come before?” asked. “you come, instead
 writing. tired dreadfully writing long letters. i’d far
 rather talked you. now, can neither bear talk, nor
 anything else. wonder zillah is! will you” (looking me)
 “step kitchen see?”
 
received thanks service; unwilling to
 run fro behest, replied—
 
“nobody joseph.”
 
“i want drink,” exclaimed fretfully, turning away. “zillah is
 constantly gadding gimmerton since papa went: it’s miserable!
 i’m obliged come here—they resolved never hear me
 upstairs.”
 
“is father attentive you, master heathcliff?” asked,
 perceiving catherine checked friendly advances.
 
“attentive? makes _them_ little attentive least,” he
 cried. “the wretches! know, miss linton, brute hareton
 laughs me! hate him! indeed, hate all: odious
 beings.”
 
cathy began searching water; lighted pitcher the
 dresser, filled tumbler, brought it. bid add spoonful of
 wine bottle table; swallowed small portion,
 appeared tranquil, said kind.
 
“and glad see me?” asked she, reiterating former
 question, pleased detect faint dawn smile.
 
“yes, am. it’s something new hear voice like yours!” replied.
 “but vexed, wouldn’t come. papa swore it
 owing me: called pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing;
 said despised me; place, be
 master grange father time. you
 don’t despise me, you, miss—?”
 
“i wish say catherine, cathy,” interrupted young lady.
 “despise you? no! next papa ellen, love better than
 anybody living. don’t love mr. heathcliff, though; dare not
 come returns: will stay away many days?”
 
“not many,” answered linton; “but goes moors frequently,
 since shooting season commenced; might spend hour two

 peevish you: you’d provoke me, you’d always ready to
 help me, wouldn’t you?”
 
“yes,” said catherine, stroking long soft hair, “if only
 get papa’s consent, i’d spend half time you. pretty linton! i
 wish brother.”
 
“and like well father?” observed he, more
 cheerfully. “but papa says love better all
 world, wife; i’d rather that.”
 
“no, never love anybody better papa,” returned
 gravely. “and people hate wives, sometimes; sisters
 brothers: latter, live us, and
 papa fond me.”
 
linton denied people ever hated wives; cathy affirmed
 did, and, wisdom, instanced father’s aversion to
 aunt. endeavoured stop thoughtless tongue. couldn’t
 succeed till everything knew out. master heathcliff, much
 irritated, asserted relation false.
 
“papa told me; papa tell falsehoods,” answered pertly.
 
“_my_ papa scorns yours!” cried linton. “he calls sneaking fool.”
 
“yours wicked man,” retorted catherine; “and naughty
 dare repeat says. must wicked made aunt
 isabella leave did.”
 
“she didn’t leave him,” said boy; “you sha’n’t contradict me.”
 
“she did,” cried young lady.
 
“well, i’ll tell _you_ something!” said linton. “your mother hated your
 father: now then.”
 
“oh!” exclaimed catherine, enraged continue.
 
“and loved mine,” added he.
 
“you little liar! hate now!” panted, face grew red
 passion.
 
“she did! did!” sang linton, sinking recess chair,

“hush, master heathcliff!” said; “that’s father’s tale, too, i
 suppose.”
 
“it isn’t: hold tongue!” answered. “she did, did,
 catherine! did, did!”
 
cathy, beside herself, gave chair violent push, caused to
 fall one arm. immediately seized suffocating cough
 soon ended triumph. lasted long frightened even
 me. cousin, wept might, aghast the
 mischief done: though said nothing. held till fit

 opposite, looked solemnly fire.
 
“how feel now, master heathcliff?” inquired, waiting ten
 minutes.
 
“i wish _she_ felt do,” replied: “spiteful, cruel thing!
 hareton never touches me: never struck life. was
 better to-day: there—” voice died whimper.
 
“_i_ didn’t strike you!” muttered cathy, chewing lip prevent

sighed moaned like one great suffering, kept for
 quarter hour; purpose distress cousin apparently, for
 whenever caught stifled sob put renewed pain and

“i’m sorry hurt you, linton,” said length, racked beyond
 endurance. “but _i_ couldn’t hurt little push, i

“i can’t speak you,” murmured; “you’ve hurt shall

summer already past prime, edgar reluctantly yielded his
 assent entreaties, catherine set first
 ride join cousin. close, sultry day: devoid of
 sunshine, sky dappled hazy threaten rain: our
 place meeting fixed guide-stone, cross-roads.
 arriving there, however, little herd-boy, despatched a
 messenger, told us that,—“maister linton wer just o’ side th’
 heights: he’d mitch obleeged us gang bit further.”
 
“then master linton forgot first injunction uncle,” i
 observed: “he bid us keep grange land, at
 once.”
 
“well, we’ll turn horses’ heads round reach him,” answered
 companion; “our excursion shall lie towards home.”
 
reached him, scarcely quarter mile from
 door, found horse; forced dismount,
 leave graze. lay heath, awaiting approach,
 rise till came within yards. walked so
 feebly, looked pale, immediately exclaimed,—“why, master
 heathcliff, fit enjoying ramble morning. ill
 look!”
 
catherine surveyed grief astonishment: changed the
 ejaculation joy lips one alarm; congratulation
 long-postponed meeting anxious inquiry, whether were
 worse usual?
 
“no—better—better!” panted, trembling, retaining hand if
 needed support, large blue eyes wandered timidly over
 her; hollowness round transforming haggard wildness the
 languid expression possessed.
 
“but worse,” persisted cousin; “worse saw
 last; thinner, and—”
 
“i’m tired,” interrupted, hurriedly. “it hot walking, let
 us rest here. and, morning, often feel sick—papa says grow
 fast.”
 
badly satisfied, cathy sat down, reclined beside her.
 
“this something like paradise,” said she, making effort at
 cheerfulness. “you recollect two days agreed spend the
 place way thought pleasantest? nearly yours, only
 clouds; soft mellow: nicer
 sunshine. next week, can, we’ll ride grange
 park, try mine.”
 
linton appear remember talked of; had
 evidently great difficulty sustaining kind conversation. his
 lack interest subjects started, equal incapacity
 contribute entertainment, obvious not
 conceal disappointment. indefinite alteration come his
 whole person manner. pettishness might caressed into
 fondness, yielded listless apathy; less the
 peevish temper child frets teases purpose be
 soothed, self-absorbed moroseness confirmed
 invalid, repelling consolation, ready regard good-humoured
 mirth others insult. catherine perceived, well did,
 held rather punishment, gratification, endure
 company; made scruple proposing, presently, to
 depart. proposal, unexpectedly, roused linton lethargy,
 threw strange state agitation. glanced fearfully
 towards heights, begging remain another half-hour, at
 least.
 
“but think,” said cathy, “you’d comfortable home than
 sitting here; amuse to-day, see, tales, and
 songs, chatter: grown wiser i, six months;
 little taste diversions now: else, amuse
 you, i’d willingly stay.”
 
“stay rest yourself,” replied. “and, catherine, don’t think or
 say i’m _very_ unwell: heavy weather heat make
 dull; walked about, came, great deal me. tell
 uncle i’m tolerable health, will you?”
 
“i’ll tell _you_ say so, linton. couldn’t affirm you
 are,” observed young lady, wondering pertinacious assertion
 evidently untruth.
 
“and next thursday,” continued he, shunning puzzled
 gaze. “and give thanks permitting come—my best
 thanks, catherine. and—and, _did_ meet father, asked
 me, don’t lead suppose i’ve extremely silent
 stupid: don’t look sad downcast, _are_ doing—he’ll be
 angry.”

“but do,” said cousin, shuddering. “_don’t_ provoke against

“is severe you, master heathcliff?” inquired. “has grown
 weary indulgence, passed passive active hatred?”
 
linton looked me, answer; and, keeping seat by
 side another ten minutes, head fell drowsily on
 breast, uttered nothing except suppressed moans of
 exhaustion pain, cathy began seek solace looking for
 bilberries, sharing produce researches me: did
 offer him, saw notice weary and
 annoy.
 
“is half-an-hour now, ellen?” whispered ear, last. “i
 can’t tell stay. he’s asleep, papa will wanting us

“well, must leave asleep,” answered; “wait till wakes,
 patient. mighty eager set off, longing to
 see poor linton soon evaporated!”
 
“why _he_ wish see me?” returned catherine. “in crossest
 humours, formerly, liked better present curious
 mood. it’s just task compelled perform—this
 interview—for fear father scold him. i’m hardly going to
 come give mr. heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason may for
 ordering linton undergo penance. and, though i’m glad he’s
 better health, i’m sorry he’s much less pleasant, much
 less affectionate me.”
 
“you think _he is_ better health, then?” said.
 
“yes,” answered; “because always made great deal his
 sufferings, know. tolerably well, told tell
 papa; he’s better, likely.”
 
“there differ me, miss cathy,” remarked; “i should
 conjecture far worse.”
 
linton started slumber bewildered terror, asked if
 one called name.
 
“no,” said catherine; “unless dreams. conceive you
 manage doze doors, morning.”
 
“i thought heard father,” gasped, glancing frowning
 nab us. “you sure nobody spoke?”
 
“quite sure,” replied cousin. “only ellen disputing
 concerning health. truly stronger, linton, we
 separated winter? be, i’m certain one thing not
 stronger—your regard me: speak,—are you?”
 
tears gushed linton’s eyes answered, “yes, yes, am!”
 and, still spell imaginary voice, gaze wandered up

cathy rose. “for to-day must part,” said. “and won’t conceal
 sadly disappointed meeting; though i’ll
 mention nobody you: stand awe mr.
 heathcliff.”
 
“hush,” murmured linton; “for god’s sake, hush! he’s coming.” he
 clung catherine’s arm, striving detain her; that
 announcement hastily disengaged herself, whistled minny, who
 obeyed like dog.
 
“i’ll next thursday,” cried, springing saddle.
 “good-bye. quick, ellen!”

 anticipating father’s approach.

 perplexed sensation pity regret, largely blended vague,
 uneasy doubts linton’s actual circumstances, physical social:

deferred excursion till afternoon; golden afternoon of
 august: every breath hills full life, seemed

 just like landscape—shadows sunshine flitting rapid

 transient; poor little heart reproached even that

 animation high spirits though, yet joy; looked
 like fear.
 
“it late!” said, speaking short difficulty. “is your
 father ill? thought wouldn’t come.”
 
“_why_ won’t candid?” cried catherine, swallowing greeting.
 “why say don’t want me? strange, linton,

 apparently distress us both, reason besides!”
 
linton shivered, glanced her, half supplicating, half ashamed;
 cousin’s patience sufficient endure enigmatical

“my father _is_ ill,” said; “and called his
 bedside? didn’t send absolve promise, you
 wished wouldn’t keep it? come! desire explanation: playing and
 trifling completely banished mind; can’t dance

“my affectations!” murmured; “what they? heaven’s sake,
 catherine, don’t look angry! despise much please; am
 worthless, cowardly wretch: can’t scorned enough; i’m too
 mean anger. hate father, spare contempt.”
 
“nonsense!” cried catherine passion. “foolish, silly boy! and

streaming face expression agony, linton thrown his
 nerveless frame along ground: seemed convulsed exquisite

“oh!” sobbed, “i bear it! catherine, catherine, i’m a
 traitor, too, dare tell you! leave me, shall be
 killed! _dear_ catherine, life hands: said
 loved me, did, wouldn’t harm you. you’ll go,
 then? kind, sweet, good catherine! perhaps _will_ consent—and
 he’ll let die you!”
 
young lady, witnessing intense anguish, stooped raise him.
 old feeling indulgent tenderness overcame vexation, she
 grew thoroughly moved alarmed.
 
“consent what?” asked. “to stay! tell meaning this
 strange talk, will. contradict words, distract
 me! calm frank, confess weighs your

“but father threatened me,” gasped boy, clasping attenuated
 fingers, “and dread him—i dread him! _dare_ tell!”
 
“oh, well!” said catherine, scornful compassion, “keep your
 secret: _i’m_ coward. save yourself: i’m afraid!”
 
magnanimity provoked tears: wept wildly, kissing her
 supporting hands, yet summon courage speak out. was
 cogitating mystery might be, determined catherine should
 never suffer benefit one else, good will; when,
 hearing rustle among ling, looked saw mr. heathcliff
 almost close upon us, descending heights. didn’t cast glance
 towards companions, though sufficiently near linton’s

“it something see near house, nelly. at

 “that edgar linton death-bed: perhaps exaggerate his

“no; master dying,” replied: “it true enough. sad thing it

“how long will last, think?” asked.
 
“i don’t know,” said.
 
“because,” continued, looking two young people, were

“lively? no—he shown greatest distress,” answered. “to see

“he shall be, day two,” muttered heathcliff. “but first—get up,
 linton! get up!” shouted. “don’t grovel ground there: up,

linton sunk prostrate another paroxysm helpless fear,

“i will, father,” panted. “only, let alone, shall faint.

“linton dear!” whispered catherine, “i can’t go wuthering heights:

“i can never re-enter house,” answered. “i’m _not_ re-enter

“stop!” cried father. “we’ll respect catherine’s filial scruples.

 perceiving us confounded, rose, expeditiously made tea

“take her, pitiful changeling!” exclaimed. “_you_ marry?

 catherine haughty, like her, can guess talk. my
 young lady asked aid first came; mr.
 heathcliff told follow business, let his

 narrow-minded, selfish woman. catherine evinced child’s
 annoyance neglect; repaid contempt, thus enlisted
 informant among enemies, securely done some
 great wrong. long talk zillah six weeks ago, a
 little came, one day foregathered moor; and
 told me.
 
“the first thing mrs. linton did,” said, “on arrival the

 entered house, asked quiver doctor might be

“‘we know that!’ answered heathcliff; ‘but life worth a

“‘but tell do,’ said; ‘and nobody will help me,
 he’ll die!’
 
“‘walk room,’ cried master, ‘and let never hear a

“then began bother me, said i’d enough plague the

 mr. heathcliff bid leave labour her.
 
“how managed together, can’t tell. fancy fretted great

“i delivered catherine’s message. cursed himself, few

 followed. mrs. heathcliff seated bedside, hands
 folded knees. father-in-law went up, held light to

 her.
 
“‘now—catherine,’ said, ‘how feel?’
 
“she dumb.
 
“‘how feel, catherine?’ repeated.
 
“‘he’s safe, i’m free,’ answered: ‘i feel well—but,’ she
 continued, bitterness couldn’t conceal, ‘you left so

 feel like death!’
 
“and looked like it, too! gave little wine. hareton and

 afterwards made joseph remove body chamber, told to

“in morning, sent tell must come to
 breakfast: undressed, appeared going sleep, said she
 ill; hardly wondered. informed mr. heathcliff, he
 replied,—‘well, let till funeral; go now and

cathy stayed upstairs fortnight, according zillah; visited her
 twice day, rather friendly, attempts

heathcliff went once, show linton’s will. bequeathed

“she seem amiable,” thought, “as mrs. dean persuade

“a letter old acquaintance, housekeeper grange,” i
 answered; annoyed exposing kind deed, fearful lest it

 thereat, catherine silently turned face us, and, very
 stealthily, drew pocket-handkerchief applied her

 put questions concerning inmates, rational and
 irrational, former home; gazing towards hills, murmured

“i like riding minny there! like be

“does ellen like you?”
 
“yes, well,” replied, hesitatingly.
 
“you must tell her,” continued, “that answer letter,

“you’d _better_ hold tongue, now,” answered fiercely.
 
agitation precluded speech; advanced hastily the

“he’s just like dog, not, ellen?” observed, “or a

“i’m going to,” answered.

 occupied subjects company, countenance
 evinced; grew serious instant, scrutinizing with
 deep gravity. afterwards turned, recommenced nonsense; at
 last, hareton uttered smothered laugh. mr. heathcliff started; his
 eye rapidly surveyed faces. catherine met accustomed

“it well reach,” exclaimed. “what fiend
 possesses stare back me, continually, infernal
 eyes? them! don’t remind existence again. i

“it me,” muttered hareton.
 
“what say?” demanded master.

“i’ve pulled two three bushes,” replied young man; “but i’m
 going set ’em again.”
 
“and pulled up?” said master.

“we wanted plant flowers there,” cried. “i’m only

“and devil gave _you_ leave touch stick place?”

“your land, insolent slut! never any,” said heathcliff.
 
“and money,” continued; returning angry glare, meantime

“i don’t think right wander doors,” observed, “instead
 bed: wise, rate moist season. i
 daresay you’ll catch bad cold, fever: something the
 matter now!”
 
“nothing can bear,” replied; “and greatest
 pleasure, provided you’ll leave alone: get in, don’t annoy me.”
 
obeyed: and, passing, noticed breathed fast cat.
 
“yes!” reflected myself, “we shall fit illness. cannot
 conceive doing.”
 
noon sat dinner us, received heaped-up plate
 hands, intended make amends previous fasting.
 
“i’ve neither cold fever, nelly,” remarked, allusion my
 morning’s speech; “and i’m ready justice food give
 me.”
 
took knife fork, going commence eating, the
 inclination appeared become suddenly extinct. laid the
 table, looked eagerly towards window, rose went out. we
 saw walking fro garden concluded meal,
 earnshaw said he’d go ask dine: thought we
 grieved way.
 
“well, coming?” cried catherine, cousin returned.
 
“nay,” answered; “but he’s angry: seemed rarely pleased
 indeed; made impatient speaking twice; he
 bid you: wondered want company of
 anybody else.”
 
set plate keep warm fender; hour two he
 re-entered, room clear, degree calmer: same
 unnatural—it unnatural—appearance joy black brows; the
 bloodless hue, teeth visible, now then, kind of
 smile; frame shivering, one shivers chill weakness,
 tight-stretched cord vibrates—a strong thrilling, rather than
 trembling.
 
will ask matter, thought; should? i
 exclaimed—“have heard good news, mr. heathcliff? look
 uncommonly animated.”
 
“where good news come me?” said. “i’m animated with
 hunger; and, seemingly, must eat.”
 
“your dinner here,” returned; “why won’t get it?”
 
“i don’t want now,” muttered, hastily: “i’ll wait till supper.
 and, nelly, all, let beg warn hareton other
 away me. wish troubled nobody: wish this
 place myself.”
 
“is new reason banishment?” inquired. “tell me
 queer, mr. heathcliff? last night? i’m
 putting question idle curiosity, but—”
 
“you putting question idle curiosity,” he
 interrupted, laugh. “yet i’ll answer it. last night the
 threshold hell. to-day, within sight heaven. my
 eyes it: hardly three feet sever me! now you’d better go!
 you’ll neither see hear anything frighten you, refrain
 prying.”
 
swept hearth wiped table, departed; perplexed
 ever.
 
quit house afternoon, one intruded on
 solitude; till, eight o’clock, deemed proper, though
 unsummoned, carry candle supper him. leaning
 ledge open lattice, looking out: face was
 turned interior gloom. fire smouldered ashes; the
 room filled damp, mild air cloudy evening; so
 still, murmur beck gimmerton was
 distinguishable, ripples gurgling pebbles, or
 large stones cover. uttered an
 ejaculation discontent seeing dismal grate, commenced
 shutting casements, one another, till came his.
 
“must close this?” asked, order rouse him; not
 stir.
 
light flashed features spoke. oh, mr. lockwood, i
 express terrible start got momentary view! those
 deep black eyes! smile, ghastly paleness! appeared me,
 mr. heathcliff, goblin; and, terror, let candle
 bend towards wall, left darkness.
 
“yes, close it,” replied, familiar voice. “there, is
 pure awkwardness! hold candle horizontally? quick,
 bring another.”
 
hurried foolish state dread, said joseph—“the
 master wishes take light rekindle fire.” i
 dared go just then.
 
joseph rattled fire shovel, went: brought it
 back immediately, supper-tray hand, explaining
 mr. heathcliff going bed, wanted nothing eat till
 morning. heard mount stairs directly; proceed to
 ordinary chamber, turned panelled bed: its
 window, mentioned before, wide enough anybody get
 through; struck plotted another midnight excursion,
 rather suspicion.
 
“is ghoul vampire?” mused. read hideous
 incarnate demons. set reflect tended him
 infancy, watched grow youth, followed almost
 whole course; absurd nonsense yield to
 sense horror. “but come from, little dark
 thing, harboured good man bane?” muttered superstition, as
 dozed unconsciousness. began, half dreaming, weary
 imagining fit parentage him; and, repeating my
 waking meditations, tracked existence again, grim
 variations; last, picturing death funeral: which, i
 can remember is, exceedingly vexed task of
 dictating inscription monument, consulting sexton
 it; and, surname, tell age, we
 obliged content single word, “heathcliff.”
 came true: were. enter kirkyard, you’ll read, his
 headstone, that, date death.
 
dawn restored common sense. rose, went garden, as
 soon see, ascertain footmarks his
 window. none. “he stayed home,” thought, “and he’ll
 right to-day.” prepared breakfast household, my
 usual custom, told hareton catherine get ere the
 master came down, lay late. preferred taking of
 doors, trees, set little table accommodate them.
 
re-entrance, found mr. heathcliff below. joseph were
 conversing farming business; gave clear, minute
 directions concerning matter discussed, spoke rapidly, and
 turned head continually aside, excited expression,
 even exaggerated. joseph quitted room took seat in
 place generally chose, put basin coffee him.
 drew nearer, rested arms table, looked at
 opposite wall, supposed, surveying one particular portion, up
 down, glittering, restless eyes, eager interest
 stopped breathing half minute together.
 
“come now,” exclaimed, pushing bread hand, “eat and
 drink that, hot: waiting near hour.”
 
didn’t notice me, yet smiled. i’d rather seen gnash
 teeth smile so.
 
“mr. heathcliff! master!” cried, “don’t, god’s sake, stare if
 saw unearthly vision.”
 
“don’t, god’s sake, shout loud,” replied. “turn round, and
 tell me, ourselves?”
 
“of course,” answer; “of course are.”
 
still, involuntarily obeyed him, quite sure. a
 sweep hand cleared vacant space front among the
 breakfast things, leant forward gaze ease.
 
now, perceived looking wall; regarded
 alone, seemed exactly gazed something within two
 yards’ distance. whatever was, communicated, apparently, both
 pleasure pain exquisite extremes: least anguished, yet
 raptured, expression countenance suggested idea. the
 fancied object fixed, either: eyes pursued with
 unwearied diligence, and, even speaking me, never weaned
 away. vainly reminded protracted abstinence food: if
 stirred touch anything compliance entreaties, he
 stretched hand get piece bread, fingers clenched
 reached it, remained table, forgetful their
 aim.
 
sat, model patience, trying attract absorbed attention
 engrossing speculation; till grew irritable, got up,
 asking allow time taking his
 meals? saying next occasion needn’t wait: might set
 things go. uttered words left house,
 slowly sauntered garden path, disappeared the
 gate.
 
hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. retire to
 rest till late, did, sleep. returned after
 midnight, and, instead going bed, shut room
 beneath. listened, tossed about, and, finally, dressed and
 descended. irksome lie there, harassing brain a
 hundred idle misgivings.
 
distinguished mr. heathcliff’s step, restlessly measuring floor,
 frequently broke silence deep inspiration, resembling a
 groan. muttered detached words also; one catch was
 name catherine, coupled wild term endearment or
 suffering; spoken one speak person present; low and
 earnest, wrung depth soul. courage to
 walk straight apartment; desired divert his
 reverie, therefore fell foul kitchen fire, stirred it, and
 began scrape cinders. drew forth sooner expected.
 opened door immediately, said—“nelly, come here—is it
 morning? come light.”
 
“it striking four,” answered. “you want candle take upstairs:
 might lit one fire.”
 
“no, don’t wish go upstairs,” said. “come in, kindle _me_ a
 fire, anything room.”
 
“i must blow coals red first, can carry any,” replied,
 getting chair bellows.
 
roamed fro, meantime, state approaching distraction; his
 heavy sighs succeeding thick leave space for
 common breathing between.
 
“when day breaks i’ll send green,” said; “i wish make some
 legal inquiries can bestow thought matters,
 can act calmly. written will yet; to
 leave property determine. wish annihilate from
 face earth.”
 
“i talk so, mr. heathcliff,” interposed. “let will be
 while: you’ll spared repent many injustices yet! i
 never expected nerves disordered: are, at
 present, marvellously so, however; almost entirely own
 fault. way you’ve passed three last days might knock a
 titan. take food, repose. need look at
 glass see require both. cheeks are
 hollow, eyes blood-shot, like person starving hunger
 going blind loss sleep.”
 
“it fault eat rest,” replied. “i assure
 settled designs. i’ll both, soon i
 possibly can. might well bid man struggling water
 rest within arms’ length shore! must reach first, then
 i’ll rest. well, never mind mr. green: repenting my
 injustices, i’ve done injustice, repent nothing. i’m too
 happy; yet i’m happy enough. soul’s bliss kills body, but
 satisfy itself.”
 
“happy, master?” cried. “strange happiness! hear me
 without angry, might offer advice make you
 happier.”
 
“what that?” asked. “give it.”
 
“you aware, mr. heathcliff,” said, “that time were
 thirteen years old lived selfish, unchristian life; and
 probably hardly bible hands period. you
 must forgotten contents book, may have
 space search now. hurtful send one—some
 minister denomination, matter which—to explain it,
 show far erred precepts; how
 unfit will heaven, unless change takes place before
 die?”
 
“i’m rather obliged angry, nelly,” said, “for remind of
 manner desire buried. carried the
 churchyard evening. hareton may, please,
 accompany me: mind, particularly, notice sexton obeys
 directions concerning two coffins! minister need come; nor
 need anything said me.—i tell nearly attained _my_
 heaven; others altogether unvalued uncoveted me.”
 
“and supposing persevered obstinate fast, died that
 means, refused bury precincts kirk?” i
 said, shocked godless indifference. “how like it?”
 
“they won’t that,” replied: “if did, must me
 removed secretly; neglect shall prove, practically,
 dead annihilated!”
 
soon heard members family stirring retired
 den, breathed freer. afternoon, joseph
 hareton work, came kitchen again, and,
 wild look, bid come sit house: wanted somebody
 him. declined; telling plainly strange talk and
 manner frightened me, neither nerve will be
 companion alone.
 
“i believe think fiend,” said, dismal laugh:
 “something horrible live decent roof.” turning to
 catherine, there, drew behind approach, he
 added, half sneeringly,—“will _you_ come, chuck? i’ll hurt you. no!
 i’ve made worse devil. well, _one_ who
 won’t shrink company! god! she’s relentless. oh, damn it!
 it’s unutterably much flesh blood bear—even mine.”
 
solicited society one more. dusk went his
 chamber. whole night, far morning, heard
 groaning murmuring himself. hareton anxious enter;
 bid fetch mr. kenneth, go see him. when
 came, requested admittance tried open door, found
 locked; heathcliff bid us damned. better, be
 left alone; doctor went away.
 
following evening wet: indeed, poured till
 day-dawn; and, took morning walk round house, observed
 master’s window swinging open, rain driving straight in. he
 bed, thought: showers drench through. he
 must either out. i’ll make ado, i’ll go boldly and
 look.
 
succeeded obtaining entrance another key, ran to
 unclose panels, chamber vacant; quickly pushing them
 aside, peeped in. mr. heathcliff there—laid back. eyes
 met mine keen fierce, started; seemed smile. i
 think dead: face throat washed with
 rain; bed-clothes dripped, perfectly still. lattice,
 flapping fro, grazed one hand rested sill; no
 blood trickled broken skin, put fingers it, i
 doubt more: dead stark!
 
hasped window; combed black long hair forehead; i
 tried close eyes: extinguish, possible, frightful,
 life-like gaze exultation one else beheld it. would
 shut: seemed sneer attempts; parted lips and
 sharp white teeth sneered too! taken another fit cowardice, i
 cried joseph. joseph shuffled made noise, but
 resolutely refused meddle him.
 
“th’ divil’s harried soul,” cried, “and may hev’ his
 carcass t’ bargin, aught care! ech! wicked ’un he
 looks, girning death!” old sinner grinned mockery. i
 thought intended cut caper round bed; suddenly
 composing himself, fell knees, raised hands, and
 returned thanks lawful master ancient stock were
 restored rights.
 
felt stunned awful event; memory unavoidably recurred
 former times sort oppressive sadness. poor hareton,
 wronged, one really suffered much. sat by
 corpse night, weeping bitter earnest. pressed hand,
 kissed sarcastic, savage face every one else shrank from
 contemplating; bemoaned strong grief springs
 naturally generous heart, though tough tempered steel.
 
mr. kenneth perplexed pronounce disorder master
 died. concealed fact swallowed nothing four
 days, fearing might lead trouble, then, persuaded, he
 abstain purpose: consequence strange
 illness, cause.
 
buried him, scandal whole neighbourhood, wished.
 earnshaw i, sexton, six men carry coffin,
 comprehended whole attendance. six men departed had
 let grave: stayed see covered. hareton, with
 streaming face, dug green sods, laid brown mould
 himself: present smooth verdant companion

 ask them, swear bible _walks_: are
 speak met near church, moor, and
 even within house. idle tales, you’ll say, say i. yet that
 old man kitchen fire affirms seen two ’em looking out
 chamber window every rainy night since death:—and odd
 thing happened month ago. going grange one
 evening—a dark evening, threatening thunder—and, just turn of
 heights, encountered little boy sheep two lambs

 skittish, guided.
 
“what matter, little man?” asked.
 
“there’s heathcliff woman yonder, t’ nab,” blubbered,
 “un’ darnut pass ’em.”
 
saw nothing; neither sheep go on, bid him
 take road lower down. probably raised phantoms from
 thinking, traversed moors alone, nonsense heard
 parents companions repeat. yet, still, don’t like out
 dark now; don’t like left grim
 house: help it; shall glad leave it, shift
 grange.
 
“they going grange, then?” said.
 
“yes,” answered mrs. dean, “as soon married, will
 new year’s day.”
 
“and will live then?”
 
“why, joseph will take care house, and, perhaps, lad keep
 company. will live kitchen, rest will shut
 up.”
 
“for use ghosts choose inhabit it?” observed.
 
“no, mr. lockwood,” said nelly, shaking head. “i believe dead

moment garden gate swung to; ramblers returning.
 
“_they_ afraid nothing,” grumbled, watching approach

stepped door-stones, halted take last look

 irresistibly impelled escape again; and, pressing remembrance

 seven months: many window showed black gaps deprived glass; and
 slates jutted off, there, beyond right line roof,
 gradually worked coming autumn storms.
 
sought, soon discovered, three headstones slope next
 moor: middle one grey, half buried heath; edgar linton’s
 harmonized turf moss creeping foot; heathcliff’s
