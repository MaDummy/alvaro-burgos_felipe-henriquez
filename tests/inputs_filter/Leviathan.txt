transcriber’s notes e-text:
 
e-text prepared pelican classics edition leviathan,
 turn prepared first edition. tried to
 follow closely possible original, give flavour of
 text hobbes proof-read, following differences
 unavoidable.
 
hobbes used capitals italics extensively, emphasis, for
 proper names, quotations, sometimes, seems, just because.
 
original extensive margin notes, used show
 introduces definitions words concepts, give in
 short subject paragraph section dealing with, to
 give references quotations, largely exclusively biblical.
 degree, margin notes seem intended serve
 place index, original none. italics.
 
also used italics words languages english, and
 number greek words, greek alphabet, text.
 
deal within limits plain vanilla ascii, done
 following e-text.
 
restricted use full capitalization places where
 hobbes used it, except chapter headings, fully
 capitalized, hobbes used mixture full capitalization and
 italics.
 
clear italics indicate text quoting,
 introduced quotation marks. within quotation marks have
 retained capitalization hobbes used.
 
italics seem used emphasis, proper names, just
 because, capitalized initial letter words. has
 disadvantage distinguished that
 hobbes capitalized plain text, extent italics would
 make text ugly use underscore slash.
 
margin notes either introduce paragraph subject,
 show introduces word definitions, included as
 headers paragraph, words initial capitals,
 shortened line.
 
margin references quotes, included text,
 brackets immediately next quotation. hobbes included
 references main text, left put them, except to
 change square brackets round.
 
greek alphabet, simply substituted nearest ordinary
 letters can, used initial capitals foreign
 language words.
 
neither thomas hobbes typesetters seem many
 inhibitions spelling punctuation. tried reproduce
 exactly, exception introduction quotation marks.
 
preparing text, found much meaning if
 read sub-vocalization, aloud, rather trying read
 silently. hobbes’ use emphasis eccentric punctuation and
 construction seem work.

 another saying late understood, might
 learn truly read one another, take pains; that
 is, nosce teipsum, read thy self: meant, now
 used, countenance, either barbarous state men power,

 sawcie behaviour towards betters; teach us, the
 similitude thoughts, passions one man, thoughts,
 passions another, whosoever looketh himselfe, and
 considereth doth, think, opine, reason, hope,

 constitution individuall, particular education vary, they
 easie kept knowledge, characters mans

let one man read another actions never perfectly, it

 kind doctrine, admitteth demonstration.
 



part i.
 man
 



chapter i. sense
 

concerning thoughts man, will consider first singly, and
 afterwards trayne, dependance upon one another. singly, they
 every one representation apparence, quality, other
 accident body without us; commonly called object. which
 object worketh eyes, eares, parts mans body; by
 diversity working, produceth diversity apparences.
 
originall all, call sense; (for is
 conception mans mind, hath first, totally, by
 parts, begotten upon organs sense.) rest derived
 originall.
 
know naturall cause sense, necessary the
 business now hand; els-where written large.
 nevertheless, fill part present method, will briefly
 deliver place.
 
cause sense, externall body, object, presseth the
 organ proper sense, either immediatly, tast touch;
 mediately, seeing, hearing, smelling: pressure, by
 mediation nerves, strings, membranes body,
 continued inwards brain, heart, causeth resistance,
 counter-pressure, endeavour heart, deliver self:
 endeavour outward, seemeth matter without. and
 seeming, fancy, men call sense; consisteth, as
 eye, light, colour figured; eare, sound; to
 nostrill, odour; tongue palat, savour; and
 rest body, heat, cold, hardnesse, softnesse, such
 qualities, discern feeling. qualities called
 sensible, object causeth them, many several
 motions matter, presseth organs diversly. neither
 us pressed, anything els, divers motions; (for
 motion, produceth nothing motion.) apparence us is
 fancy, waking, dreaming. pressing, rubbing,
 striking eye, makes us fancy light; pressing eare,
 produceth dinne; bodies also see, hear, produce the
 strong, though unobserved action, colours,
 sounds, bodies, objects cause them, could
 bee severed them, glasses, ecchoes reflection,
 wee see are; know thing see, one place; the
 apparence, another. though certain distance, reall,
 object seem invested fancy begets us; yet still
 object one thing, image fancy another. sense in
 cases, nothing els originall fancy, caused (as said)
 pressure, is, motion, externall things upon our
 eyes, eares, organs thereunto ordained.
 
philosophy-schooles, universities of
 christendome, grounded upon certain texts aristotle, teach another
 doctrine; say, cause vision, thing seen, sendeth
 forth every side visible species(in english) visible shew,
 apparition, aspect, seen; receiving whereof the
 eye, seeing. cause hearing, thing heard,
 sendeth forth audible species, is, audible aspect, audible
 seen; entring eare, maketh hearing. nay the
 cause understanding also, say thing understood sendeth forth
 intelligible species, is, intelligible seen; which
 comming understanding, makes us understand. say this,
 disapproving use universities: speak
 hereafter office common-wealth, must let see on
 occasions way, things amended them; amongst
 frequency insignificant speech one.
 


chapter ii. imagination
 

thing lies still, unlesse somewhat els stirre it, will
 lye still ever, truth man doubts of. a
 thing motion, will eternally motion, unless somewhat els
 stay it, though reason same, (namely, nothing can change
 selfe,) easily assented to. men measure, onely
 men, things, themselves: find
 subject motion pain, lassitude, think every
 thing els growes weary motion, seeks repose accord;
 little considering, whether motion, wherein that
 desire rest find themselves, consisteth. hence is,
 schooles say, heavy bodies fall downwards, appetite
 rest, conserve nature place proper
 them; ascribing appetite, knowledge good their
 conservation, (which man has) things inanimate absurdly.
 
body motion, moveth (unless something els hinder
 it) eternally; whatsoever hindreth it, instant, in
 time, degrees quite extinguish it: wee see water,
 though wind cease, waves give rowling long
 time after; also happeneth motion, made the
 internall parts man, then, sees, dreams, &c. the
 object removed, eye shut, wee still retain image the
 thing seen, though obscure see it. it,
 latines call imagination, image made seeing; apply
 same, though improperly, senses. greeks
 call fancy; signifies apparence, proper one sense,
 another. imagination therefore nothing decaying sense; and
 found men, many living creatures, well sleeping, as
 waking.
 



memory
 
decay sense men waking, decay motion made in
 sense; obscuring it, manner, light sun
 obscureth light starres; starrs less exercise
 vertue visible, day, night.
 amongst many stroaks, eyes, eares, other
 organs receive externall bodies, predominant onely sensible;
 therefore light sun predominant, affected
 action starrs. object removed our
 eyes, though impression made us remain; yet objects more
 present succeeding, working us, imagination past is
 obscured, made weak; voyce man noyse the
 day. whence followeth, longer time is, the
 sight, sense object, weaker imagination. the
 continuall change mans body, destroyes time parts in
 sense moved: distance time, place, hath one
 effect us. distance place, wee
 look at, appears dimme, without distinction smaller parts;
 voyces grow weak, inarticulate: also great distance
 time, imagination past weak; wee lose( example)
 cities wee seen, many particular streets; actions, many
 particular circumstances. decaying sense, wee express
 thing self, (i mean fancy selfe,) wee call imagination, i
 said before; express decay, signifie the
 sense fading, old, past, called memory. imagination
 memory, one thing, divers considerations hath
 divers names.
 
much memory, memory many things, called experience. againe,
 imagination things formerly
 perceived sense, either once, parts severall
 times; former, (which imagining whole object, was
 presented sense) simple imagination; one imagineth a
 man, horse, hath seen before. compounded; as
 sight man one time, horse another, we
 conceive mind centaure. man compoundeth image of
 person, image actions man; a
 man imagins himselfe hercules, alexander, (which happeneth often
 much taken reading romants) compound
 imagination, properly fiction mind. also other
 imaginations rise men, (though waking) great impression
 made sense; gazing upon sun, impression leaves an
 image sun eyes long time after; long
 vehemently attent upon geometricall figures, man shall the
 dark, (though awake) images lines, angles his
 eyes: kind fancy hath particular name; thing that
 doth commonly fall mens discourse.
 



dreams
 
imaginations sleep, call dreams. these
 also (as imaginations) before, either totally, or
 parcells sense. sense, brain, nerves,
 necessary organs sense, benummed sleep, as
 easily moved action externall objects, can
 happen sleep, imagination; therefore dreame, what
 proceeds agitation inward parts mans body; which
 inward parts, connexion brayn, other
 organs, distempered, keep motion; whereby
 imaginations formerly made, appeare man waking;
 saving organs sense now benummed, is
 new object, can master obscure vigorous
 impression, dreame must needs cleare, silence of
 sense, waking thoughts. hence cometh pass, that
 hard matter, many thought impossible distinguish
 exactly sense dreaming. part, consider, that
 dreames, often, constantly think persons,
 places, objects, actions waking; remember long a
 trayne coherent thoughts, dreaming, times; because
 waking often observe absurdity dreames, never dream of
 absurdities waking thoughts; well satisfied, being
 awake, know dreame not; though dreame, think selfe
 awake.
 
seeing dreames caused distemper inward
 parts body; divers distempers must needs cause different dreams.
 hence is, lying cold breedeth dreams feare, raiseth
 thought image fearfull object (the motion the
 brain inner parts, inner parts brain being
 reciprocall:) anger causeth heat parts body,
 awake; sleep, heating parts
 causeth anger, raiseth brain imagination enemy.
 manner; naturall kindness, awake causeth
 desire; desire makes heat certain parts body; so
 also, much heat parts, wee sleep, raiseth the
 brain imagination kindness shewn. summe, dreams are
 reverse waking imaginations; motion awake,
 beginning one end; dream, another.
 



apparitions visions
 
difficult discerning mans dream, waking thoughts,
 then, accident observe slept:
 easie happen man full fearfull thoughts; and
 whose conscience much troubled; sleepeth, without the
 circumstances, going bed, putting clothes, one that
 noddeth chayre. taketh pains, industriously layes
 himselfe sleep, case uncouth exorbitant fancy come unto
 him, easily think dream. read marcus
 brutes, (one life given julius caesar, also
 favorite, notwithstanding murthered him,) phillipi,
 night gave battell augustus caesar, saw fearfull
 apparition, commonly related historians vision: but
 considering circumstances, one may easily judge but
 short dream. sitting tent, pensive troubled the
 horrour rash act, hard him, slumbering the
 cold, dream affrighted him; feare, by
 degrees made wake; also must needs make apparition by
 degrees vanish: assurance slept, have
 cause think dream, thing vision. no
 rare accident: even perfectly awake, be
 timorous, supperstitious, possessed fearfull tales, alone
 dark, subject like fancies, believe see
 spirits dead mens ghosts walking churchyards; whereas is
 either fancy onely, els knavery persons, make
 use superstitious feare, pass disguised night, to
 places known haunt.
 
ignorance distinguish dreams, strong
 fancies, vision sense, arise greatest part the
 religion gentiles time past, worshipped satyres, fawnes,
 nymphs, like; now adayes opinion rude people have
 fayries, ghosts, goblins; power witches. for
 witches, think witch craft reall power; yet
 justly punished, false beliefe have, that
 can mischiefe, joyned purpose they
 can; trade neerer new religion, craft or
 science. fayries, walking ghosts, opinion i
 think purpose, either taught, confuted, keep in
 credit use exorcisme, crosses, holy water, such
 inventions ghostly men. neverthelesse, doubt, god can
 make unnaturall apparitions. often, men need
 feare things, feare stay, change, the
 course nature, also can stay, change, point of
 christian faith. evill men pretext god can thing,
 bold say thing serves turn, though
 think untrue; part wise man, believe no
 further, right reason makes say, appear credible.
 superstitious fear spirits taken away, it,
 prognostiques dreams, false prophecies, many things
 depending thereon, which, crafty ambitious persons abuse the
 simple people, men much fitted civill
 obedience.
 
work schooles; rather nourish
 doctrine. (not knowing imagination, senses are),
 receive, teach: saying, imaginations rise of
 themselves, cause: others rise commonly from
 will; good thoughts blown (inspired) man, by
 god; evill thoughts divell: good thoughts powred
 (infused) man, god; evill ones divell. say
 senses receive species things, deliver the
 common-sense; common sense delivers fancy, and
 fancy memory, memory judgement, like
 handing things one another, many words making nothing
 understood.
 



understanding
 
imagination raysed man (or creature indued with
 faculty imagining) words, voluntary signes, that
 generally call understanding; common man beast. a
 dogge custome will understand call, rating master;
 will many beasts. understanding peculiar to
 man, understanding onely will; conceptions and
 thoughts, sequell contexture names things into
 affirmations, negations, formes speech: kinde
 understanding shall speak hereafter.
 


chapter iii. consequence trayne imaginations
 

consequence, trayne thoughts, understand succession
 one thought another, called (to distinguish from
 discourse words) mentall discourse.
 
man thinketh thing whatsoever, next thought after, is
 altogether casuall seems be. every thought every
 thought succeeds indifferently. wee imagination, whereof
 formerly sense, whole, parts; no
 transition one imagination another, whereof never the
 like senses. reason whereof this. fancies
 motions within us, reliques made sense: those
 motions immediately succeeded one another sense, continue
 also together sense: much former comming to
 take place, praedominant, later followeth, coherence of
 matter moved, manner, water upon plain table drawn
 way one part guided finger. because
 sense, one thing perceived, sometimes one thing,
 sometimes another succeedeth, comes passe time, the
 imagining thing, certainty shall imagine
 next; onely certain, shall something succeeded the
 before, one time another.
 



trayne thoughts unguided
 
trayne thoughts, mentall discourse, two sorts. the
 first unguided, without designee, inconstant; wherein no
 passionate thought, govern direct follow, self,
 end scope desire, passion: case the
 thoughts said wander, seem impertinent one another, as
 dream. commonly thoughts men, onely
 without company, also without care thing; though even then
 thoughts busie times, without harmony; as
 sound lute tune yeeld man; tune,
 one play. yet wild ranging mind,
 man may oft-times perceive way it, dependance one
 thought upon another. discourse present civill warre,
 seem impertinent, ask (as one did) the
 value roman penny? yet cohaerence manifest enough.
 thought warre, introduced thought delivering
 king enemies; thought that, brought thought
 delivering christ; thought 30
 pence, price treason: thence easily followed
 malicious question; moment time; thought
 quick.
 



trayne thoughts regulated
 
second constant; regulated desire, and
 designee. impression made things wee desire, or
 feare, strong, permanent, or, (if cease time,) quick
 return: strong sometimes, hinder break sleep.
 desire, ariseth thought means seen produce the
 like ayme at; thought that, the
 thought means mean; continually, till come some
 beginning within power. end, greatnesse
 impression, comes often mind, case thoughts begin to
 wander, quickly reduced way: observed by
 one seven wise men, made give men praecept, is
 now worne out, respice finem; say, actions,
 look often upon have, thing directs your
 thoughts way attain it.
 



remembrance
 
trayn regulated thoughts two kinds; one, effect
 imagined, wee seek causes, means produce it: this
 common man beast. is, imagining thing
 whatsoever, wee seek possible effects, can be
 produced; say, imagine can it, wee
 it. time seen signe, man
 onely; curiosity hardly incident nature any
 living creature passion sensuall, are
 hunger, thirst, lust, anger. summe, discourse mind,
 governed designee, nothing seeking, faculty
 invention, latines call sagacitas, solertia; hunting
 causes, effect, present past; effects,
 present past cause, sometimes man seeks hath lost;
 place, time, wherein hee misses it, mind runs
 back, place place, time time, find where, when
 it; say, find certain, limited time and
 place, begin method seeking. again, thence, his
 thoughts run places times, find action, or
 occasion might make lose it. call remembrance,
 calling mind: latines call reminiscentia, a
 re-conning former actions.
 
sometimes man knows place determinate, within compasse whereof
 seek; thoughts run parts thereof,
 manner, one sweep room, find jewell; as
 spaniel ranges field, till find sent; man run
 alphabet, start rime.
 



prudence
 
sometime man desires know event action; he
 thinketh like action past, events thereof one after
 another; supposing like events will follow like actions. that
 foresees wil become criminal, re-cons seen follow
 like crime before; order thoughts, crime,
 officer, prison, judge, gallowes. kind
 thoughts, called foresight, prudence, providence; and
 sometimes wisdome; though conjecture, difficulty of
 observing circumstances, fallacious. certain; by
 much one man experience things past, another; by
 much also prudent, expectations seldomer faile
 him. present onely nature; things past being
 memory onely, things come all; future
 fiction mind, applying sequels actions past,
 actions present; certainty done by
 experience; certainty enough. though
 called prudence, event answereth expectation; yet in
 nature, presumption. foresight things to
 come, providence, belongs onely whose will are
 come. onely, supernaturally, proceeds prophecy. best
 prophet naturally best guesser; best guesser, is
 versed studied matters guesses at: hath most
 signes guesse by.
 



signes
 
signe, event antecedent, consequent; contrarily,
 consequent antecedent, like consequences been
 observed, before: oftner observed, lesse
 uncertain signe. therefore experience in
 kind businesse, signes, whereby guesse future
 time, consequently prudent: much prudent
 new kind business, equalled by
 advantage naturall extemporary wit: though perhaps many young
 men think contrary.
 
neverthelesse prudence distinguisheth man beast.
 beasts, year old observe more, pursue which
 good, prudently, child can ten.
 



conjecture time past
 
prudence praesumtion future, contracted the
 experience time past; praesumtion things past taken
 things (not future but) past also. hath seen
 courses degrees, flourishing state hath first come into
 civill warre, ruine; upon sights ruines any
 state, will guesse, like warre, like courses been
 also. conjecture, incertainty almost the
 conjecture future; grounded onely upon experience.
 
act mans mind, can remember, naturally
 planted him, so, need thing, exercise it,
 born man, live use five senses. those
 faculties, shall speak by, seem proper
 man onely, acquired, encreased study industry; of
 men learned instruction, discipline; proceed from
 invention words, speech. besides sense, thoughts, and
 trayne thoughts, mind man motion; though by
 help speech, method, facultyes may improved to
 height, distinguish men living creatures.
 
whatsoever imagine, finite. therefore idea, or
 conception anything call infinite. man can mind an
 image infinite magnitude; conceive ends, bounds of
 thing named; conception thing, own
 inability. therefore name god used, make us
 conceive him; (for incomprehensible; greatnesse, power
 unconceivable;) may honour him. also whatsoever
 (as said before,) conceive, perceived first sense,
 either once, parts; man can thought, representing
 thing, subject sense. man therefore can conceive any
 thing, must conceive place; indued some
 determinate magnitude; may divided parts; any
 thing place, another place time;
 two, things can one, place once:
 none things ever have, can incident sense; are
 absurd speeches, taken upon credit (without signification all,)
 deceived philosophers, deceived, deceiving schoolemen.
 


chapter iv. speech
 



originall speech
 
invention printing, though ingenious, compared invention
 letters, great matter. first found use
 letters, known. first brought greece, men
 say cadmus, sonne agenor, king phaenicia. profitable
 invention continuing memory time past, conjunction of
 mankind, dispersed many, distant regions earth; and
 difficult, proceeding watchfull observation the
 divers motions tongue, palat, lips, organs speech;
 whereby make many differences characters, remember them.
 noble profitable invention other, of
 speech, consisting names apellations, connexion; whereby
 men register thoughts; recall past; also
 declare one another mutuall utility conversation;
 without which, amongst men, neither common-wealth, nor
 society, contract, peace, amongst lyons, bears,
 wolves. first author speech god himselfe, instructed
 adam name creatures presented sight; the
 scripture goeth matter. sufficient
 direct adde names, experience use the
 creatures give occasion; joyn manner by
 degrees, make himselfe understood; succession time,
 much language might gotten, found use for; though so
 copious, orator philosopher need of. find any
 thing scripture, which, directly consequence can
 gathered, adam taught names figures, numbers,
 measures, colours, sounds, fancies, relations; much less names
 words speech, generall, speciall, affirmative, negative,
 interrogative, optative, infinitive, usefull; least of
 all, entity, intentionality, quiddity, significant words of
 school.
 
language gotten, augmented adam posterity,
 lost tower babel, hand god, every man
 stricken rebellion, oblivion former language.
 hereby forced disperse severall parts of
 world, must needs be, diversity tongues now is,
 proceeded degrees them, manner, need (the mother of
 inventions) taught them; tract time grew every more
 copious.
 



use speech
 
generall use speech, transferre mentall discourse, into
 verbal; trayne thoughts, trayne words; that
 two commodities; whereof one is, registring consequences
 thoughts; apt slip memory, put
 us new labour, may recalled, words were
 marked by. first use names, serve markes,
 notes remembrance. another is, many use words,
 signifie (by connexion order,) one another, they
 conceive, think matter; also desire, feare,
 passion for, use called
 signes. speciall uses speech these; first, register, by
 cogitation, wee find cause thing, present past; and
 find things present past may produce, effect: in
 summe, acquiring arts. secondly, shew others knowledge
 attained; is, counsell, teach one another.
 thirdly, make known others wills, purposes, may
 mutuall help one another. fourthly, please delight
 selves, others, playing words, pleasure or
 ornament, innocently.
 



abuses speech
 
uses, also foure correspondent abuses. first,
 men register thoughts wrong, inconstancy the
 signification words; register their
 conceptions, never conceived; deceive themselves.
 secondly, use words metaphorically; is, sense
 ordained for; thereby deceive others. thirdly,
 words declare will, not.
 fourthly, use grieve one another: seeing nature
 hath armed living creatures, teeth, horns, some
 hands, grieve enemy, abuse speech, grieve
 tongue, unlesse one wee obliged govern;
 grieve, correct amend.
 
manner speech serveth remembrance consequence
 causes effects, consisteth imposing names, the
 connexion them.
 



names proper & common universall
 
names, proper, singular one onely thing; peter,
 john, man, tree: common many things; man,
 horse, tree; every though one name, nevertheless the
 name divers particular things; respect together, it
 called universall; nothing world universall
 names; things named, every one individual and
 singular.
 
one universall name imposed many things, similitude in
 quality, accident: whereas proper name bringeth to
 mind one thing onely; universals recall one many.
 
names universall, more, lesse extent; the
 larger comprehending lesse large: equall extent,
 comprehending reciprocally. example, name body is
 larger signification word man, conprehendeth it; the
 names man rationall, equall extent, comprehending mutually
 one another. wee must take notice, name not
 alwayes understood, grammar, one onely word; sometimes by
 circumlocution many words together. words, hee in
 actions observeth lawes country, make one name,
 equivalent one word, just.
 
imposition names, larger, stricter
 signification, turn reckoning consequences things
 imagined mind, reckoning consequences of
 appellations. example, man hath use speech all,
 (such, born remains perfectly deafe dumb,) set
 eyes triangle, two right angles, (such the
 corners square figure,) may meditation compare find, that
 three angles triangle, equall two right angles
 stand it. another triangle shewn different in
 shape former, know without new labour, whether the
 three angles also equall same. hath the
 use words, observes, equality consequent, not
 length sides, particular thing his
 triangle; onely this, sides straight, the
 angles three; all, named triangle;
 will boldly conclude universally, equality angles in
 triangles whatsoever; register invention generall
 termes, every triangle hath three angles equall two right angles.
 thus consequence found one particular, comes registred
 remembred, universall rule; discharges mentall
 reckoning, time place; delivers us labour the
 mind, saving first; makes found true here, and
 now, true times places.
 
use words registring thoughts, nothing so
 evident numbering. naturall foole never learn by
 heart order numerall words, one, two, three, may observe
 every stroak clock, nod it, say one, one, one; can
 never know houre strikes. seems, time when
 names number use; men fayn apply their
 fingers one hands, things desired keep
 account of; thence proceeded, now numerall words
 ten, nation, five, begin
 again. can tell ten, recite order, will
 lose himselfe, know done: much lesse will be
 able add, substract, performe operations of
 arithmetique. without words, possibility of
 reckoning numbers; much lesse magnitudes, swiftnesse, force,
 things, reckonings whereof necessary being, or
 well-being man-kind.
 
two names joyned together consequence, affirmation;
 thus, man living creature; thus, man, a
 living creature, later name living creature, signifie that
 former name man signifieth, affirmation, consequence is
 true; otherwise false. true false attributes speech, not
 things. speech not, neither truth falshood.
 errour may be, wee expect shall be; or
 suspect been: neither case can man charged with
 untruth.
 
seeing truth consisteth right ordering names our
 affirmations, man seeketh precise truth, need remember
 every name uses stands for; place accordingly; els
 will find himselfe entangled words, bird lime-twiggs; the
 struggles, belimed. therefore geometry, (which
 onely science hath pleased god hitherto bestow on
 mankind,) men begin settling significations words; which
 settling significations, call definitions; place the
 beginning reckoning.
 
appears necessary man aspires true
 knowledge, examine definitions former authors; either
 correct them, negligently set down; make them
 himselfe. errours definitions multiply themselves, according
 reckoning proceeds; lead men absurdities, last
 see, avoyd, without reckoning anew beginning;
 lyes foundation errours. whence happens,
 trust books, cast many little
 summs greater, without considering whether little summes
 rightly cast not; last finding errour visible,
 mistrusting first grounds, know way cleere
 themselves; spend time fluttering bookes; birds
 entring chimney, finding inclosed a
 chamber, flitter false light glasse window, want wit
 consider way came in. right definition
 names, lyes first use speech; acquisition of
 science: wrong, definitions’ lyes first abuse; from
 proceed false senslesse tenets; make men that
 take instruction authority books, their
 meditation, much condition ignorant men, as
 men endued true science it. true science,
 erroneous doctrines, ignorance middle. naturall sense and
 imagination, subject absurdity. nature selfe erre:
 men abound copiousnesse language; become wise,
 mad ordinary. possible without letters any
 man become either excellently wise, (unless memory hurt by
 disease, ill constitution organs) excellently foolish. words
 wise mens counters, reckon them: the
 mony fooles, value authority aristotle, a
 cicero, thomas, doctor whatsoever, man.
 



subject names
 
subject names, whatsoever can enter into, considered an
 account; added one another make summe; substracted one
 another, leave remainder. latines called accounts mony
 rationes, accounting, ratiocinatio: bills or
 books account call items, called nomina; is, names: and
 thence seems proceed, extended word ratio, the
 faculty reckoning things. greeks one word
 logos, speech reason; thought no
 speech without reason; reasoning without speech: act of
 reasoning called syllogisme; signifieth summing the
 consequences one saying another. things may
 enter account divers accidents; names (to shew that
 diversity) diversly wrested, diversified. diversity names
 may reduced foure generall heads.
 
first, thing may enter account matter, body; living,
 sensible, rationall, hot, cold, moved, quiet; names the
 word matter, body understood; such, names matter.
 
secondly, may enter account, considered, accident
 quality, conceive it; moved, being
 long, hot, &c; then, name thing selfe,
 little change wresting, wee make name accident, which
 consider; living put account life; moved, motion;
 hot, heat; long, length, like. names, are
 names accidents properties, one matter, body
 distinguished another. called names abstract; because
 severed (not matter, but) account matter.
 
thirdly, bring account, properties bodies,
 whereby make distinction: thing seen us, we
 reckon thing selfe; sight, colour, idea of
 fancy: thing heard, wee reckon not; the
 hearing, sound onely, fancy conception the
 eare: names fancies.
 
fourthly, bring account, consider, give names, names
 themselves, speeches: for, generall, universall, speciall,
 oequivocall, names names. affirmation, interrogation,
 commandement, narration, syllogisme, sermon, oration, many other
 such, names speeches.
 



use names positive
 
variety names positive; put mark
 somewhat nature, may feigned mind man, as
 bodies are, may conceived be; bodies, properties
 are, may feigned be; words speech.
 



negative names uses
 
also names, called negative; notes signifie
 word name thing question; words
 nothing, man, infinite, indocible, three want foure, the
 like; nevertheless use reckoning, correcting of
 reckoning; call mind past cogitations, though not
 names thing; make us refuse admit names not
 rightly used.
 



words insignificant
 
names, insignificant sounds; two
 sorts. one, new, yet meaning explained by
 definition; whereof aboundance coyned schoole-men,
 pusled philosophers.
 
another, men make name two names, whose significations are
 contradictory inconsistent; name, incorporeall body, or
 (which one) incorporeall substance, great number more.
 whensoever affirmation false, two names it
 composed, put together made one, signifie nothing all. for
 example false affirmation say quadrangle round,
 word round quadrangle signifies nothing; meere sound. so
 likewise false, say vertue can powred, blown up
 down; words in-powred vertue, in-blown vertue, absurd
 insignificant, round quadrangle. therefore shall hardly
 meet senselesse insignificant word, made of
 latin greek names. frenchman seldome hears saviour called
 name parole, name verbe often; yet verbe and
 parole differ more, one latin, french.
 



understanding
 
man upon hearing speech, hath thoughts the
 words speech, connexion, ordained constituted
 signifie; said understand it; understanding being
 nothing els, conception caused speech. therefore speech
 peculiar man (as know is,) understanding
 peculiar also. therefore absurd false affirmations,
 case universall, can understanding; though many
 think understand, then, repeat words softly,
 mind.
 
kinds speeches signifie appetites, aversions, passions
 mans mind; use abuse, shall speak have
 spoken passions.
 



inconstant names
 
names things affect us, is, please, and
 displease us, men alike affected thing,
 man times, common discourses men, of
 inconstant signification. seeing names imposed signifie
 conceptions; affections conceptions; we
 conceive things differently, can hardly avoyd different
 naming them. though nature conceive, the
 same; yet diversity reception it, respect different
 constitutions body, prejudices opinion, gives everything a
 tincture different passions. therefore reasoning, man
 bust take heed words; besides signification we
 imagine nature, disposition, interest speaker; such
 names vertues, vices; one man calleth wisdome,
 another calleth feare; one cruelty, another justice;
 one prodigality, another magnanimity; one gravity, another
 stupidity, &c. therefore names can never true grounds any
 ratiocination. can metaphors, tropes speech: these
 less dangerous, profess inconstancy; the
 not.
 


chapter v. reason, science.
 



reason is
 
man reasoneth, hee nothing els conceive summe totall,
 addition parcels; conceive remainder, substraction of
 one summe another: (if done words,) conceiving of
 consequence names parts, name whole;
 names whole one part, name other
 part. though things, (as numbers,) besides adding and
 substracting, men name operations, multiplying dividing;
 yet same; multiplication, addition together of
 things equall; division, substracting one thing, often as
 can. operations incident numbers onely, to
 manner things can added together, taken one of
 another. arithmeticians teach adde substract numbers;
 geometricians teach lines, figures (solid and
 superficiall,) angles, proportions, times, degrees swiftnesse, force,
 power, like; logicians teach consequences
 words; adding together two names, make affirmation; two
 affirmations, make syllogisme; many syllogismes make a
 demonstration; summe, conclusion syllogisme, they
 substract one proposition, finde other. writers politiques,
 adde together pactions, find mens duties; lawyers, lawes and
 facts, find right wrong actions private men.
 summe, matter soever place addition and
 substraction, also place reason; no
 place, reason nothing do.
 



reason defined
 
may define, (that say determine,) that
 is, meant word reason, wee reckon amongst
 faculties mind. reason, sense, nothing but
 reckoning (that is, adding substracting) consequences of
 generall names agreed upon, marking signifying our
 thoughts; say marking them, reckon selves; and
 signifying, demonstrate, approve reckonings men.
 



right reason where
 
arithmetique, unpractised men must, professors themselves
 may often erre, cast false; also subject of
 reasoning, ablest, attentive, practised men, may
 deceive themselves, inferre false conclusions; reason
 selfe always right reason, well arithmetique certain
 infallible art: one mans reason, reason any
 one number men, makes certaintie; account is
 therefore well cast up, great many men unanimously
 approved it. therfore, controversy account,
 parties must accord, set right reason, the
 reason arbitrator, judge, whose sentence will
 stand, controversie must either come blowes, be
 undecided, want right reason constituted nature; is
 also debates kind soever: men think
 wiser others, clamor demand right reason for
 judge; yet seek more, things determined, no
 mens reason own, intolerable society of
 men, play trump turned, use trump every
 occasion, suite whereof hand. do
 nothing els, will every passions, comes to
 bear sway them, taken right reason, own
 controversies: bewraying want right reason, claym they
 lay it.
 



use reason
 
use end reason, finding summe, truth
 one, consequences, remote first definitions, and
 settled significations names; begin these; proceed from
 one consequence another. can certainty last
 conclusion, without certainty affirmations negations,
 grounded, inferred. master family,
 taking account, casteth summs bills expence,
 one sum; regarding bill summed up, those
 give account; payes for; advantages
 himselfe more, allowed account grosse, trusting to
 every accountants skill honesty; also reasoning all
 things, takes conclusions trust authors, and
 doth fetch first items every reckoning, (which are
 significations names settled definitions), loses labour;
 know thing; onely beleeveth.
 



error absurdity
 
man reckons without use words, may done in
 particular things, (as upon sight one thing, wee
 conjecture likely preceded, likely follow upon
 it;) thought likely follow, followes not; that
 thought likely preceded it, hath preceded it, this
 called error; even prudent men subject. but
 reason words generall signification, fall upon a
 generall inference false; though commonly called error,
 indeed absurdity, senseless speech. error a
 deception, presuming somewhat past, come; which,
 though past, come; yet impossibility
 discoverable. make generall assertion, unlesse a
 true one, possibility unconceivable. words whereby we
 conceive nothing sound, call absurd, insignificant,
 non-sense. therefore man talk round
 quadrangle; accidents bread cheese; immaterial substances;
 free subject; free will; free, free being
 hindred opposition, say errour; that
 words without meaning; say, absurd.
 
said before, (in second chapter,) man excell
 animals faculty, conceived thing
 whatsoever, apt enquire consequences it, what
 effects it. now adde degree the
 excellence, can words reduce consequences findes
 generall rules, called theoremes, aphorismes; is, can
 reason, reckon, onely number; things, whereof
 one may added unto, substracted another.
 
priviledge, allayed another; is, the
 priviledge absurdity; living creature subject, man
 onely. men, subject it, professe
 philosophy. true cicero sayth somewhere;
 can nothing absurd, may found books of
 philosophers. reason manifest. one them
 begins ratiocination definitions, explications of
 names use; method hath used onely
 geometry; whose conclusions thereby made indisputable.
 



causes absurditie
 
first cause absurd conclusions ascribe want method;
 begin ratiocination definitions; that
 is, settled significations words: cast
 account, without knowing value numerall words, one, two, and
 three.
 
whereas bodies enter account upon divers considerations,
 (which mentioned precedent chapter;) considerations
 diversly named, divers absurdities proceed confusion, and
 unfit connexion names assertions. therefore
 
second cause absurd assertions, ascribe giving names
 bodies, accidents; accidents, bodies; do, that
 say, faith infused, inspired; nothing can powred, or
 breathed thing, body; that, extension body; that
 phantasmes spirits, &c.
 
third ascribe giving names accidents of
 bodies without us, accidents bodies; that
 say, colour body; sound ayre, &c.
 
fourth, giving names bodies, names, speeches;
 say, things universall; living
 creature genus, generall thing, &c.
 
fifth, giving names accidents, names and
 speeches; say, nature thing its
 definition; mans command will; like.
 
sixth, use metaphors, tropes, rhetoricall
 figures, stead words proper. though lawfull say, (for
 example) common speech, way goeth, leadeth hither, thither,
 proverb sayes (whereas wayes go, proverbs
 speak;) yet reckoning, seeking truth, speeches to
 admitted.
 
seventh, names signifie nothing; taken up, and
 learned rote schooles, hypostatical, transubstantiate,
 consubstantiate, eternal-now, like canting schoole-men.
 
can avoyd things, easie fall any
 absurdity, unlesse length account; wherein may
 perhaps forget went before. men nature reason alike, and
 well, good principles. stupid, to
 mistake geometry, also persist it, another detects his
 error him?
 



science
 
appears reason sense, memory, borne with
 us; gotten experience onely; prudence is; attayned by
 industry; first apt imposing names; secondly getting good
 orderly method proceeding elements, names,
 assertions made connexion one another; to
 syllogismes, connexions one assertion another, till
 come knowledge consequences names appertaining to
 subject hand; it, men call science. whereas
 sense memory knowledge fact, thing past, and
 irrevocable; science knowledge consequences, dependance
 one fact upon another: which, can presently do, we
 know something els will, like, another time;
 see thing comes about, upon causes, by
 manner; like causes come power, wee see to
 make produce like effects.
 
children therefore endued reason all, till have
 attained use speech: called reasonable creatures, the
 possibility apparent use reason time come. and
 part men, though use reasoning little
 way, numbring degree; yet serves little use in
 common life; govern themselves, better, worse,
 according differences experience, quicknesse memory, and
 inclinations severall ends; specially according good evill
 fortune, errors one another. science, certain
 rules actions, farre it, know
 is. geometry thought conjuring: other
 sciences, taught beginnings, some
 progresse them, may see acquired generated,
 point like children, thought generation,
 made believe women, brothers sisters not
 born, found garden.
 
yet science, better, nobler condition
 naturall prudence; men, mis-reasoning, by
 trusting reason wrong, fall upon false absurd generall
 rules. ignorance causes, rules, set men farre
 way, relying false rules, taking causes of
 aspire to, so, rather causes the
 contrary.
 
conclude, light humane minds perspicuous words, by
 exact definitions first snuffed, purged ambiguity; reason is
 pace; encrease science, way; benefit man-kind, the
 end. contrary, metaphors, senslesse ambiguous words,
 like ignes fatui; reasoning upon them, wandering amongst
 innumerable absurdities; end, contention, sedition, or
 contempt.
 



prudence & sapience, difference
 
as, much experience, prudence; so, much science, sapience. for
 though wee usually one name wisedome both; yet
 latines always distinguish prudentia sapientia,
 ascribing former experience, later science. make
 difference appeare cleerly, let us suppose one man endued
 excellent naturall use, dexterity handling armes; and
 another added dexterity, acquired science, where
 can offend, offended adversarie, every possible
 posture, guard: ability former, ability
 later, prudence sapience; usefull; later
 infallible. trusting onely authority books,
 follow blind blindly, like trusting false rules
 master fence, ventures praesumptuously upon adversary, that
 either kills, disgraces him.
 



signes science
 
signes science, some, certain infallible; some,
 uncertain. certain, pretendeth science thing,
 can teach same; say, demonstrate truth thereof
 perspicuously another: uncertain, onely particular events
 answer pretence, upon many occasions prove sayes
 must. signes prudence uncertain; observe by
 experience, remember circumstances may alter successe,
 impossible. businesse, whereof man infallible
 science proceed by; forsake natural judgement, be
 guided generall sentences read authors, subject many
 exceptions, signe folly, generally scorned name of
 pedantry. even men themselves, councells the
 common-wealth, love shew reading politiques history,
 domestique affaires, particular
 interest concerned; prudence enough private
 affaires: publique study reputation owne
 wit, successe anothers businesse.
 


chapter vi. interiour beginnings voluntary motions
 
commonly called passions. speeches are
 expressed.
 



motion vitall animal
 
animals, two sorts motions peculiar them: one called
 vitall; begun generation, continued without interruption through
 whole life; course bloud, pulse, the
 breathing, concoctions, nutrition, excretion, &c; motions
 needs help imagination: animal motion,
 otherwise called voluntary motion; go, speak, move of
 limbes, manner first fancied minds. sense,
 motion organs interiour parts mans body, caused by
 action things see, heare, &c.; fancy the
 reliques motion, remaining sense, already
 sayd first second chapters. going, speaking, and
 like voluntary motions, depend alwayes upon precedent thought of
 whither, way, what; evident, imagination is
 first internall beginning voluntary motion. although
 unstudied men, doe conceive motion there, where
 thing moved invisible; space moved in, (for the
 shortnesse it) insensible; yet doth hinder, such
 motions are. let space never little, moved
 greater space, whereof little one part, must first be
 moved that. small beginnings motion, within body
 man, appear walking, speaking, striking, other
 visible actions, commonly called endeavour.
 



endeavour; appetite; desire; hunger; thirst; aversion
 
endeavour, toward something causes it, called
 appetite, desire; later, generall name; other,
 oftentimes restrayned signifie desire food, namely hunger and
 thirst. endeavour fromward something, generally
 called aversion. words appetite, aversion the
 latines; signifie motions, one approaching,
 retiring. also greek words same, which
 orme aphorme. nature selfe often presse upon men
 truths, afterwards, look somewhat beyond
 nature, stumble at. schooles find meere appetite go,
 move, actuall motion all: motion must
 acknowledge, call metaphoricall motion; absurd
 speech; though words may called metaphoricall; bodies, and
 motions cannot.
 
men desire, also sayd love; hate those
 things, aversion. desire, love, the
 thing; save desire, alwayes signifie absence of
 object; love, commonly presence same. also
 aversion, signifie absence; hate, presence the
 object.
 
appetites, aversions, born men; appetite of
 food, appetite excretion, exoneration, (which may also more
 properly called aversions, somewhat feele bodies;)
 appetites, many. rest, appetites of
 particular things, proceed experience, triall effects
 upon themselves, men. things wee know all, or
 believe be, can desire, tast try.
 aversion wee things, onely know hurt us;
 also know whether will hurt us, not.
 



contempt
 
things neither desire, hate, said contemne:
 contempt nothing els immobility, contumacy heart,
 resisting action certain things; proceeding the
 heart already moved otherwise, either potent objects; from
 want experience them.
 
constitution mans body, continuall mutation;
 impossible things alwayes cause him
 appetites, aversions: much lesse can men consent, in
 desire almost one object.
 



good evill
 
whatsoever object mans appetite desire; is
 it, part calleth good: object hate,
 aversion, evill; contempt, vile, inconsiderable.
 words good, evill, contemptible, ever used with
 relation person useth them: nothing simply and
 absolutely so; common rule good evill, taken from
 nature objects themselves; person man
 (where common-wealth;) or, (in common-wealth,) the
 person representeth it; arbitrator judge, men
 disagreeing shall consent set up, make sentence rule
 thereof.
 



pulchrum turpe; delightfull profitable; unpleasant unprofitable
 
latine tongue two words, whose significations approach to
 good evill; precisely same; are
 pulchrum turpe. whereof former signifies that, some
 apparent signes promiseth good; later, that, promiseth
 evill. tongue generall names expresse them
 by. pulchrum, say things, fayre; beautifull,
 handsome, gallant, honourable, comely, amiable; and
 turpe, foule, deformed, ugly, base, nauseous, like, the
 subject shall require; words, proper places signifie
 nothing els, mine, countenance, promiseth good and
 evill. good three kinds; good promise,
 pulchrum; good effect, end desired, called
 jucundum, delightfull; good means, called utile,
 profitable; many evill: evill, promise, that
 call turpe; evill effect, end, molestum, unpleasant,
 troublesome; evill means, inutile, unprofitable, hurtfull.
 



delight displeasure
 
as, sense, really within us, (as sayd
 before) onely motion, caused action externall objects, in
 apparence; sight, light colour; eare, sound; the
 nostrill, odour, &c: so, action object continued
 eyes, eares, organs heart; real effect
 nothing motion, endeavour; consisteth appetite,
 aversion, to, object moving. apparence, sense
 motion, wee either call delight, trouble mind.
 



pleasure offence
 
motion, called appetite, apparence it
 delight, pleasure, seemeth be, corroboration vitall motion,
 help thereunto; therefore things caused delight, were
 improperly called jucunda, (a juvando,) helping fortifying;
 contrary, molesta, offensive, hindering, troubling the
 motion vitall.
 
pleasure therefore, (or delight,) apparence, sense good;
 molestation displeasure, apparence, sense evill. and
 consequently appetite, desire, love, accompanied some
 delight lesse; hatred, aversion, lesse
 displeasure offence.
 



pleasures sense; pleasures mind; joy paine griefe
 
pleasures, delights, arise sense object
 present; may called pleasures sense, (the word sensuall,
 used onely condemn them, place till
 lawes.) kind onerations exonerations the
 body; also pleasant, sight, hearing, smell,
 tast, touch; others arise expectation, proceeds from
 foresight end, consequence things; whether things in
 sense please displease: pleasures mind of
 draweth consequences; generally called joy. in
 like manner, displeasures, sense, called payne;
 others, expectation consequences, called griefe.
 
simple passions called appetite, desire, love, aversion, hate,
 joy, griefe, names divers considerations diversified.
 first, one succeed another, diversly called from
 opinion men likelihood attaining they
 desire. secondly, object loved hated. thirdly, the
 consideration many together. fourthly, alteration or
 succession selfe.
 

hope-- appetite opinion attaining, called hope.
 
despaire-- same, without opinion, despaire.
 
feare-- aversion, opinion hurt object, feare.

 blamed, allowed, according means riches are
 sought.
 
ambition-- desire office, precedence, ambition: name used also
 worse sense, reason mentioned.
 
pusillanimity-- desire things conduce little ends;

 appetite food, pleasures sense, praedominance,
 take away care knowing causes; lust mind,
 perseverance delight continuall indefatigable
 generation knowledge, exceedeth short vehemence carnall
 pleasure.
 
religion superstition; true religion-- feare power invisible, feigned
 mind, imagined tales publiquely allowed, religion; not
 allowed, superstition. power imagined truly we
 imagine, true religion.
 
panique terrour-- feare, without apprehension why, what,
 panique terror; called fables make pan author of
 them; whereas truth always feareth, first,
 apprehension cause, though rest run away example;
 every one supposing fellow know why. therefore passion
 happens none throng, multitude people.
 
admiration-- joy, apprehension novelty, admiration; proper to
 man, excites appetite knowing cause.
 
glory vaine-glory-- joy, arising imagination man’s power
 ability, exultation mind called glorying:
 which, grounded upon experience former actions, is
 confidence: grounded flattery others, or
 onely supposed himselfe, delight consequences it,
 called vaine-glory: name properly given; a
 well-grounded confidence begetteth attempt; whereas supposing of
 power not, therefore rightly called vaine.
 
dejection-- griefe, opinion want power, called dejection
 mind.
 
vaine-glory consisteth feigning supposing of
 abilities ourselves, know not, incident young
 men, nourished histories fictions gallant persons; and
 corrected often times age, employment.
 
sudden glory laughter-- sudden glory, passion maketh those
 grimaces called laughter; caused either sudden act of
 own, pleaseth them; apprehension some
 deformed thing another, comparison whereof suddenly applaud
 themselves. incident them, conscious the
 fewest abilities themselves; forced keep in
 favour, observing imperfections men.
 therefore much laughter defects others signe of
 pusillanimity. great minds, one proper workes is, help
 free others scorn; compare onely most
 able.
 
sudden dejection weeping-- contrary, sudden dejection the
 passion causeth weeping; caused accidents, as
 suddenly take away vehement hope, prop power: and
 subject it, rely principally helps externall,

impudence-- contempt good reputation called impudence.
 
pitty-- griefe, calamity another pitty; ariseth
 imagination like calamity may befall himselfe; and
 therefore called also compassion, phrase present
 time fellow-feeling: therefore calamity arriving from

cruelty-- contempt, little sense calamity others, that
 men call cruelty; proceeding security fortune.
 for, man take pleasure mens’ great harmes,

deliberation-- mind man, appetites aversions, hopes
 feares, concerning one thing, arise alternately; and
 divers good evill consequences doing, omitting thing
 propounded, come successively thoughts; sometimes we
 appetite it, sometimes aversion it; sometimes hope to
 able it; sometimes despaire, feare attempt it; whole
 sum desires, aversions, hopes feares, continued till thing be
 either done, thought impossible, call deliberation.
 
therefore things past, deliberation; manifestly
 impossible changed: things known impossible, or
 thought so; men know, think deliberation vaine. but
 things impossible, think possible, may deliberate; not
 knowing vain. called deliberation; a
 putting end liberty doing, omitting, according to
 appetite, aversion.
 
alternate succession appetites, aversions, hopes feares is

 propounded; also beginning aversion,

formes speech, passion
 
formes speech passions expressed, partly the
 same, partly different those, express thoughts.
 first generally passions may expressed indicatively; as, i
 love, feare, joy, deliberate, will, command: them
 particular expressions themselves, nevertheless not
 affirmations, unless serve make inferences,
 besides passion proceed from. deliberation expressed
 subjunctively; speech proper signifie suppositions, with
 consequences; as, done, will follow; and
 differs language reasoning, save reasoning in
 generall words, deliberation part particulars.
 language desire, aversion, imperative; as, this,
 forbear that; party obliged do, forbear, is
 command; otherwise prayer; els counsell. language vaine-glory,
 indignation, pitty revengefulness, optative: desire to
 know, peculiar expression called interrogative; as, is
 it, shall it, done, so? language the
 passions find none: cursing, swearing, reviling, like, do
 signifie speech; actions tongue accustomed.
 
forms speech, say, expressions, voluntary
 significations passions: certain signes not; because
 may used arbitrarily, whether use them, such
 passions not. best signes passions present, either the
 countenance, motions body, actions, ends, aims, we
 otherwise know man have.
 



good evill apparent
 
deliberation appetites aversions raised by
 foresight good evill consequences, sequels action
 whereof deliberate; good evill effect thereof dependeth the
 foresight long chain consequences, seldome man
 able see end. far man seeth, good
 consequences greater evill, whole chain that
 writers call apparent seeming good. contrarily, the
 evill exceedeth good, whole apparent seeming evill: so
 hath experience, reason, greatest surest
 prospect consequences, deliberates best himself; able, he
 will, give best counsel unto others.
 



felicity
 
continual successe obtaining things man time to
 time desireth, say, continual prospering, men call
 felicity; mean felicity life. thing
 perpetual tranquillity mind, live here; life
 motion, can never without desire, without
 feare, without sense. kind felicity god hath
 ordained devoutly honour him, man shall sooner know,
 enjoy; joys, now incomprehensible, word of
 school-men, beatifical vision, unintelligible.
 



praise magnification
 
form speech whereby men signifie opinion goodnesse
 anything praise. whereby signifie power and
 greatness anything magnifying. whereby signifie
 opinion man’s felicity greeks called
 makarismos, name tongue. thus much is
 sufficient present purpose said passions.
 


chapter vii. ends resolutions discourse
 

discourse, governed desire knowledge, last
 end, either attaining, giving over. chain of
 discourse, wheresoever interrupted, end time.
 



judgement, sentence final; doubt
 
discourse meerly mentall, consisteth thoughts the
 thing will be, will be; been, been,
 alternately. wheresoever break chayn mans
 discourse, leave praesumption will be, or, will
 be; been, or, been. opinion. that
 alternate appetite, deliberating concerning good evil,
 alternate opinion enquiry truth past, and
 future. last appetite deliberation called will, so
 last opinion search truth past, future, called
 judgement, resolute final sentence discourseth.
 whole chain appetites alternate, question good
 bad called deliberation; whole chain opinions alternate,
 question true, false called doubt.
 
discourse whatsoever, can end absolute knowledge fact, past, or
 come. for, knowledge fact, originally, sense; and
 ever after, memory. knowledge consequence, have
 said called science, absolute, conditionall. no
 man can know discourse, this, that, is, been, will
 be; know absolutely: onely, be, is; if
 been, been; shall be, shall be: which
 know conditionally; consequence one thing to
 another; one name thing, another name thing.
 



science opinion conscience
 
therefore, discourse put speech, begins with
 definitions words, proceeds connexion into
 general affirmations, syllogismes, end or
 last sum called conclusion; thought mind it
 signified conditional knowledge, knowledge consequence
 words, commonly called science. first ground of
 discourse definitions, definitions rightly
 joyned together syllogismes, end conclusion again
 opinion, namely truth somewhat said, though sometimes in
 absurd senslesse words, without possibility understood.
 two, men, know one fact, said
 conscious one another; much know it
 together. fittest witnesses facts one
 another, third, was, ever will reputed evill
 act, man speak conscience; corrupt force
 another do: insomuch plea conscience, always
 hearkened unto diligently times. afterwards, men made use
 word metaphorically, knowledge secret
 facts, secret thoughts; therefore rhetorically said that
 conscience thousand witnesses. last all, men, vehemently
 love new opinions, (though never absurd,) and
 obstinately bent maintain them, gave opinions also that
 reverenced name conscience, seem unlawful,
 change speak them; pretend know true,
 know think so.
 



beliefe faith
 
mans discourse beginneth definitions, beginneth either
 contemplation own, still called
 opinion; beginneth saying another, whose ability to
 know truth, whose honesty deceiving, doubteth
 not; discourse much concerning thing, the
 person; resolution called beleefe, faith: faith, the
 man; beleefe, man, truth sayes. so
 beleefe two opinions; one saying man; the
 vertue. faith in, trust to, beleeve man,
 signifie thing; namely, opinion veracity man:
 beleeve said, signifieth onely opinion truth
 saying. wee observe phrase, beleeve in;
 also latine, credo in; greek, pisteno eis, never used
 writings divines. stead them, writings are
 put, beleeve him; faith him; rely him: latin,
 credo illi; fido illi: greek, pisteno anto: this
 singularity ecclesiastical use word hath raised many
 disputes right object christian faith.
 
beleeving in, creed, meant, trust the
 person; confession acknowledgement doctrine. not
 onely christians, manner men believe god, hold
 truth heare say, whether understand it, not;
 faith trust can possibly person
 whatsoever: believe doctrine creed.
 
whence may inferre, wee believe saying whatsoever
 be, true, arguments taken, thing selfe, or
 principles naturall reason, authority, and
 good opinion wee have, hath sayd it; speaker, or
 person believe in, trust in, whose word take, object of
 faith; honour done believing, done onely. and
 consequently, wee believe scriptures word god,
 immediate revelation god himselfe, beleefe, faith,
 trust church; whose word take, acquiesce therein.
 believe prophet relates unto the
 name god, take word prophet, honour him, him
 trust, believe, touching truth relateth, whether he
 true, false prophet. also history.
 believe written historians, the
 glorious acts alexander, caesar; think ghost of
 alexander, caesar, just cause offended; body
 else, historian. livy say gods made cow speak, and
 believe not; wee distrust god therein, livy. is
 evident, whatsoever believe, upon reason, is
 drawn authority men onely, writings; whether be
 sent god not, faith men onely.
 


chapter viii. vertues commonly called intellectual; their
 contrary defects
 



intellectuall vertue defined
 
vertue generally, sorts subjects, somewhat valued
 eminence; consisteth comparison. things
 equally men, nothing prized. vertues
 intellectuall, always understood abilityes mind, men
 praise, value, desire themselves; go commonly under
 name good witte; though word witte, used also, to
 distinguish one certain ability rest.
 



wit, naturall, acquired
 
vertues two sorts; naturall, acquired. naturall, i
 mean not, man hath birth: nothing else
 sense; wherein men differ little one another, brute
 beasts, reckoned amongst vertues. mean, that
 witte, gotten use onely, experience; without method,
 culture, instruction. naturall witte, consisteth principally
 two things; celerity imagining, (that is, swift succession one
 thought another;) steddy direction approved end. the
 contrary slow imagination, maketh defect, fault mind,
 commonly called dulnesse, stupidity, sometimes other
 names signifie slownesse motion, difficulty moved.
 



good wit, fancy; good judgement; discretion
 
difference quicknesse, caused difference mens
 passions; love dislike, one thing, another: and
 therefore mens thoughts run one way, another: held to,
 observe differently things passe imagination.
 whereas succession mens thoughts, nothing to
 observe things think on, either like one
 another, unlike, serve for, they
 serve purpose; observe similitudes, case
 rarely observed others, sayd a
 good wit; which, occasion, meant good fancy. they
 observe differences, dissimilitudes; called
 distinguishing, discerning, judging thing thing; in
 case, discerning easie, said good judgement:
 particularly matter conversation businesse; wherein,
 times, places, persons discerned, vertue called
 discretion. former, is, fancy, without help judgement,
 commended vertue: later judgement, and
 discretion, commended selfe, without help fancy.
 besides discretion times, places, persons, necessary a
 good fancy, required also often application thoughts
 end; say, use made them. done;
 hath vertue, will easily fitted similitudes, that
 will please, onely illustration discourse, adorning it
 new apt metaphors; also, rarity invention.
 without steddinesse, direction end, great fancy one
 kind madnesse; have, entring discourse,
 snatched purpose, every thing comes their
 thought, many, long digressions, parentheses, that
 utterly lose themselves: kind folly, know particular
 name for: cause is, sometimes want experience; whereby
 seemeth man new rare, doth others:
 sometimes pusillanimity; seems great him, other
 men think trifle: whatsoever new, great, therefore
 thought fit told, withdrawes man degrees intended
 way discourse.
 
good poem, whether epique, dramatique; also sonnets,
 epigrams, pieces, judgement fancy required:
 fancy must eminent; please the
 extravagancy; displease indiscretion.
 
good history, judgement must eminent; goodnesse
 consisteth, method, truth, choyse the
 actions profitable known. fancy place, but
 onely adorning stile.
 
orations prayse, invectives, fancy praedominant;
 designe truth, honour dishonour; is
 done noble, vile comparisons. judgement suggest
 circumstances make action laudable, culpable.
 
hortatives, pleadings, truth, disguise serveth best the
 designe hand; judgement, fancy required.
 
demonstration, councell, rigourous search truth,
 judgement all; except sometimes understanding need be
 opened apt similitude; much use fancy.
 metaphors, case utterly excluded. seeing
 openly professe deceipt; admit councell, reasoning,
 manifest folly.
 
discourse whatsoever, defect discretion be
 apparent, extravagant soever fancy be, whole discourse
 will taken signe want wit; will never the
 discretion manifest, though fancy never ordinary.
 
secret thoughts man run things, holy, prophane,
 clean, obscene, grave, light, without shame, blame; verball
 discourse do, farther judgement shall approve the
 time, place, persons. anatomist, physitian may speak, or
 write judgement unclean things; please,
 profit: another man write extravagant, pleasant
 fancies same, man, tumbled dirt,
 come present himselfe good company. ’tis want
 discretion makes difference. again, profest remissnesse
 mind, familiar company, man may play sounds, and
 aequivocal significations words; many times encounters
 extraordinary fancy: sermon, publique, before
 persons unknown, reverence, gingling of
 words will accounted folly: difference onely in
 want discretion. wit wanting, fancy
 wanting, discretion. judgement therefore without fancy is
 wit, fancy without judgement not.
 



prudence
 
thoughts man, designe hand, running a
 multitude things, observes conduce designe; what
 designe may conduce into; observations not
 easie, usuall, wit called prudence; dependeth on
 much experience, memory like things, consequences
 heretofore. much difference men, is
 fancies judgements; experience men equall
 age, much unequall, quantity; lyes different
 occasions; every one private designes. govern well a
 family, kingdome, different degrees prudence; but
 different sorts businesse; draw picture little,
 great, greater life, different degrees art. a
 plain husband-man prudent affaires house, a
 privy counseller affaires another man.
 



craft
 
prudence, adde use unjust, dishonest means, such
 usually prompted men feare, want; crooked
 wisdome, called craft; signe pusillanimity. for
 magnanimity contempt unjust, dishonest helps. which
 latines call versutia, (translated english, shifting,) is
 putting present danger incommodity, engaging into
 greater, man robbs one pay another, shorter
 sighted craft, called versutia, versura, signifies taking
 mony usurie, present payment interest.
 



acquired wit
 
acquired wit, (i mean acquired method instruction,) there
 none reason; grounded right use speech; and
 produceth sciences. reason science, already spoken
 fifth sixth chapters.
 
causes difference witts, passions: and
 difference passions, proceedeth partly different
 constitution body, partly different education. if
 difference proceeded temper brain, organs of
 sense, either exterior interior, lesse difference
 men sight, hearing, senses, fancies,
 discretions. proceeds therefore passions; are
 different, onely difference mens complexions; also
 difference customes, education.
 
passions cause differences wit, are
 principally, lesse desire power, riches, knowledge,
 honour. may reduced first, desire of
 power. riches, knowledge honour severall sorts power.
 



giddinesse madnesse
 
therefore, man great passion things;
 men terme indifferent; though may farre good
 man, free giving offence; yet possibly have
 either great fancy, much judgement. thoughts, the
 desires, scouts, spies, range abroad, find way the
 things desired: stedinesse minds motion, quicknesse
 same, proceeding thence. desire, to
 dead: weak passions, dulnesse; passions
 indifferently every thing, giddinesse, distraction; have
 stronger, vehement passions thing, ordinarily
 seen others, men call madnesse.
 
whereof almost many kinds, passions themselves.
 sometimes extraordinary extravagant passion, proceedeth the
 evill constitution organs body, harme done them; and
 sometimes hurt, indisposition organs, caused the
 vehemence, long continuance passion. cases the
 madnesse one nature.
 
passion, whose violence, continuance maketh madnesse, either
 great vaine-glory; commonly called pride, selfe-conceipt;
 great dejection mind.
 



rage
 
pride, subjecteth man anger, excesse whereof, madnesse
 called rage, fury. thus comes passe excessive desire
 revenge, becomes habituall, hurteth organs, becomes
 rage: excessive love, jealousie, becomes also rage: excessive
 opinion mans selfe, divine inspiration, wisdome,
 learning, forme, like, becomes distraction, giddinesse:
 same, joyned envy, rage: vehement opinion truth any
 thing, contradicted others, rage.
 



melancholy
 
dejection, subjects man causelesse fears; madnesse
 commonly called melancholy, apparent also divers manners; in
 haunting solitudes, graves; superstitious behaviour; in
 fearing one, another particular thing. summe, passions
 produce strange unusuall behaviour, called generall
 name madnesse. severall kinds madnesse, that
 take paines, might enrowle legion. excesses be
 madnesse, doubt passions themselves, tend
 evill, degrees same.
 
(for example,) though effect folly, possessed of
 opinion inspired, visible alwayes one man, any
 extravagant action, proceedeth passion; yet when
 many conspire together, rage whole multitude is
 visible enough. argument madnesse can greater, than
 clamour, strike, throw stones best friends? yet is
 somewhat lesse multitude will do. will clamour,
 fight against, destroy those, lifetime before,
 protected, secured injury. be
 madnesse multitude, every particular man. for
 middest sea, though man perceive sound of
 part water next him; yet well assured, part
 contributes much, roaring sea, part, of
 quantity: also, thought wee perceive great unquietnesse,
 one, two men; yet may well assured, singular
 passions, parts seditious roaring troubled nation. and
 nothing else bewrayed madnesse; yet very
 arrogating inspiration themselves, argument enough. some
 man bedlam entertaine sober discourse; desire
 taking leave, know were, might another time
 requite civility; tell you, god father;
 think need expect extravagant action argument his
 madnesse.
 
opinion inspiration, called commonly, private spirit, begins
 often, lucky finding errour generally held by
 others; knowing, remembring, conduct reason,
 came singular truth, (as think it, though many
 times untruth light on,) presently admire themselves; as
 speciall grace god almighty, hath revealed same
 supernaturally, spirit.
 
again, madnesse nothing else, much appearing passion,
 may gathered effects wine, with
 evill disposition organs. variety of
 behaviour men drunk much, of
 mad-men: raging, others loving, others laughing, all
 extravagantly, according severall domineering passions:
 effect wine, remove dissimulation; take from
 sight deformity passions. for, (i believe) the
 sober men, walk alone without care employment the
 mind, unwilling vanity extravagance thoughts
 time publiquely seen: confession, that
 passions unguided, part meere madnesse.
 
opinions world, antient later ages, concerning
 cause madnesse, two. some, deriving the
 passions; some, daemons, spirits, either good, bad, which
 thought might enter man, possesse him, move organs
 strange, uncouth manner, mad-men use do. former
 sort therefore, called men, mad-men: later, called them
 sometimes daemoniacks, (that is, possessed spirits;) sometimes
 energumeni, (that agitated, moved spirits;) now in
 italy called onely pazzi, mad-men; also spiritati, men
 possest.
 
great conflux people abdera, city the
 greeks, acting tragedy andromeda, upon extream hot
 day: whereupon, great many spectators falling fevers, had
 accident heat, tragedy together, they
 nothing pronounce iambiques, names perseus and
 andromeda; together fever, cured, comming on
 winter: madnesse thought proceed passion
 imprinted tragedy. likewise raigned fit madnesse in
 another graecian city, seized onely young maidens; caused
 many hang themselves. thought act of
 divel. one suspected, contempt life them,
 might proceed passion mind, supposing not
 contemne also honour, gave counsell magistrates, strip
 hang’d themselves, let hang naked. the
 story sayes cured madnesse. side, same
 graecians, often ascribe madnesse, operation the
 eumenides, furyes; sometimes ceres, phoebus, gods:
 much men attribute phantasmes, think aereal living
 bodies; generally call spirits. romans this,
 held opinion greeks: also jewes; they
 calle mad-men prophets, (according thought spirits
 good bad) daemoniacks; called prophets, and
 daemoniacks, mad-men; called man daemoniack, and
 mad-man. gentiles, ’tis wonder; diseases, and
 health; vices, vertues; many naturall accidents, them
 termed, worshipped daemons. man understand by
 daemon, well (sometimes) ague, divell. jewes to
 opinion, somewhat strange. neither moses, abraham
 pretended prophecy possession spirit; voyce of
 god; vision dream: thing law,
 morall, ceremoniall, taught, such
 enthusiasme; possession. god sayd, (numb. 11. 25.) to
 take spirit moses, give 70. elders,
 spirit god (taking substance god) divided.
 scriptures spirit god man, mean mans spirit, enclined
 godlinesse. said (exod. 28. 3.) "whom filled
 spirit wisdome make garments aaron," meant a
 spirit put them, can make garments; wisdome their
 spirits kind work. like sense, spirit of
 man, produceth unclean actions, ordinarily called unclean
 spirit; spirits, though alwayes, yet often the
 vertue vice stiled, extraordinary, eminent. neither the
 prophets old testament pretend enthusiasme; or, god
 spake them; voyce, vision, dream; burthen
 lord possession, command. jewes
 fall opinion possession? can imagine reason, that
 common men; namely, want curiosity search
 naturall causes; placing felicity, acquisition the
 grosse pleasures senses, things immediately
 conduce thereto. see strange, unusuall ability, or
 defect mans mind; unlesse see withall, cause may
 probably proceed, can hardly think naturall; naturall,
 must needs thinke supernaturall; can be, but
 either god, divell him? hence came passe,
 saviour (mark 3.21.) compassed multitude,
 house doubted mad, went hold him: but
 scribes said belzebub, it, cast out
 divels; greater mad-man awed lesser. (john
 10. 20.) said, "he hath divell, mad;" whereas others
 holding prophet, sayd, "these words one that
 hath divell." old testament came anoynt jehu, (2
 kings 9.11.) prophet; company asked jehu, "what
 came mad-man for?" summe, manifest, whosoever
 behaved himselfe extraordinary manner, thought jewes be
 possessed either good, evill spirit; except sadduces,
 erred farre hand, believe at
 spirits, (which neere direct atheisme;) thereby
 perhaps provoked others, terme men daemoniacks, rather
 mad-men.
 
saviour proceed curing them, they
 possest; mad. can give other
 kind answer, given urge scripture
 like manner opinion motion earth. the
 scripture written shew unto men kingdome god; to
 prepare mindes become obedient subjects; leaving the
 world, philosophy thereof, disputation men, the
 exercising naturall reason. whether earths, suns motion
 make day, night; whether exorbitant actions men,
 proceed passion, divell, (so worship not) is
 one, obedience, subjection god almighty; is
 thing scripture written. saviour
 speaketh disease, person; usuall phrase all
 cure words onely, christ did, (and inchanters pretend to
 do, whether speak divel not.) christ also said
 (math. 8.26.) rebuked winds? said also (luk. 4.
 39.) rebuke fever? yet argue fever divel.
 whereas many divels said confesse christ; not
 necessary interpret places otherwise, mad-men
 confessed him. whereas saviour (math. 12. 43.) speaketh an
 unclean spirit, gone man, wandreth dry
 places, seeking rest, finding none; returning same
 man, seven spirits worse himselfe; manifestly a
 parable, alluding man, little endeavour quit his
 lusts, vanquished strength them; becomes seven times
 worse was. see nothing scripture, that
 requireth beliefe, daemoniacks thing mad-men.
 



insignificant speech
 
yet another fault discourses men; may also
 numbred amongst sorts madnesse; namely, abuse words,
 whereof spoken fifth chapter, name of
 absurdity. is, men speak words, put together, have
 signification all; fallen upon some, through
 misunderstanding words received, repeat rote; by
 others, intention deceive obscurity. incident to
 none those, converse questions matters incomprehensible,
 schoole-men; questions abstruse philosophy. common
 sort men seldome speak insignificantly, therefore, those
 egregious persons counted idiots. assured words
 without thing correspondent mind, would
 need examples; man require, let take schoole-man
 hands, see can translate one chapter concerning
 difficult point; trinity; deity; nature christ;
 transubstantiation; free-will. &c. moderne tongues, so

 absurdity, may rightly numbred amongst many sorts madnesse;
 time guided clear thoughts worldly lust,
 forbear disputing, writing thus, lucide intervals. thus
 much vertues defects intellectuall.

 power common-wealth: titles, old time titles

 absent, one may neverthelesse worthy man, valuable for
 thing else. again, man may worthy riches, office, and
 employment, neverthelesse, can plead right before
 another; therefore said merit deserve it. merit,
 praesupposeth right, thing deserved due promise: of

chapter xi. difference manners
 



meant manners
 
manners, mean here, decency behaviour; one man should
 salute another, man wash mouth, pick teeth
 company, points small morals; those
 qualities man-kind, concern living together peace, and
 unity. end consider, felicity life,
 consisteth repose mind satisfied. such
 finis ultimus, (utmost ayme,) summum bonum, (greatest good,) is
 spoken books old morall philosophers. can man
 live, whose desires end, he, whose senses and
 imaginations stand. felicity continuall progresse the
 desire, one object another; attaining former, being
 still way later. cause whereof is, object
 mans desire, enjoy onely, one instant time;
 assure ever, way future desire. therefore the
 voluntary actions, inclinations men, tend, the
 procuring, also assuring contented life; differ
 onely way: ariseth partly diversity passions,
 divers men; partly difference knowledge, or
 opinion one causes, produce effect desired.
 



restlesse desire power, men
 
first place, put generall inclination all
 mankind, perpetuall restlesse desire power power, that
 ceaseth onely death. cause this, alwayes man
 hopes intensive delight, already attained to; or
 content moderate power: cannot
 assure power means live well, hath present, without
 acquisition more. hence is, kings, whose power
 greatest, turn endeavours assuring home lawes,
 abroad wars: done, succeedeth new desire;
 some, fame new conquest; others, ease sensuall
 pleasure; others, admiration, flattered excellence in
 art, ability mind.
 



love contention competition
 
competition riches, honour, command, power, enclineth to
 contention, enmity, war: way one competitor, the
 attaining desire, kill, subdue, supplant, repell the
 other. particularly, competition praise, enclineth reverence of
 antiquity. men contend living, dead; these
 ascribing due, may obscure glory other.
 



civil obedience love ease
 
desire ease, sensuall delight, disposeth men obey common
 power: desires, man doth abandon protection might
 hoped industry, labour.
 



feare death wounds
 
fear death, wounds, disposeth same; same
 reason. contrary, needy men, hardy, contented their
 present condition; also, men ambitious military
 command, enclined continue causes warre; stirre up
 trouble sedition: honour military warre; nor
 hope mend ill game, causing new shuffle.
 



love arts
 
desire knowledge, arts peace, enclineth men obey common
 power: desire, containeth desire leasure; consequently
 protection power own.
 



love vertue, love praise
 
desire praise, disposeth laudable actions, please them
 whose judgement value; men contemn, contemn
 also praises. desire fame death same. though
 death, sense praise given us earth, being
 joyes, either swallowed unspeakable joyes heaven,
 extinguished extreme torments hell: yet fame
 vain; men present delight therein, foresight
 it, benefit may rebound thereby posterity:
 though now see not, yet imagine; thing is
 pleasure sense, also pleasure imagination.
 



hate, difficulty requiting great benefits
 
received one, think selves equall, greater
 benefits hope requite, disposeth counterfiet love;
 really secret hatred; puts man estate desperate
 debtor, declining sight creditor, tacitely wishes
 there, might never see more. benefits oblige; and
 obligation thraldome; ones equall, hateful. have
 received benefits one, acknowledge superiour, enclines
 love; obligation new depession: cheerfull
 acceptation, (which men call gratitude,) honour done to
 obliger, taken generally retribution. also receive
 benefits, though equall, inferiour, long hope
 requitall, disposeth love: intention receiver,
 obligation ayd, service mutuall; whence proceedeth
 emulation shall exceed benefiting; noble and
 profitable contention possible; wherein victor pleased his
 victory, revenged confessing it.
 



conscience deserving hated
 
done hurt man, can, willing expiate,
 enclineth doer hate sufferer. must expect revenge, or
 forgivenesse; hatefull.
 



promptnesse hurt, fear
 
feare oppression, disposeth man anticipate, seek ayd by
 society: way man can secure life
 liberty.
 



distrust wit
 
men distrust subtilty, tumult, sedition,
 better disposed victory, suppose wise,
 crafty. love consult, (fearing be
 circumvented,) strike first. sedition, men alwayes in
 procincts battell, hold together, use advantages of
 force, better stratagem, can proceed subtilty of
 wit.
 



vain undertaking vain-glory
 
vain-glorious men, without conscious of
 great sufficiency, delight supposing gallant men, are
 enclined onely ostentation; attempt: when
 danger difficulty appears, look nothing their
 insufficiency discovered.
 
vain-glorious men, estimate sufficiency flattery
 men, fortune precedent action, without assured
 ground hope true knowledge themselves, enclined to
 rash engaging; approach danger, difficulty, retire
 can: seeing way safety, will rather
 hazard honour, may salved excuse; their
 lives, salve sufficient.
 



ambition, opinion sufficiency
 
men strong opinion wisdome matter of
 government, disposed ambition. without publique
 employment counsell magistracy, honour wisdome is
 lost. therefore eloquent speakers enclined ambition; for
 eloquence seemeth wisdome, others
 



irresolution, great valuing small matters
 
pusillanimity disposeth men irresolution, consequently lose
 occasions, fittest opportunities action. men have
 deliberation till time action approach, not
 manifest best done, tis signe, difference of
 motives, one way other, great: therefore to
 resolve then, lose occasion weighing trifles; is
 pusillanimity.
 
frugality,(though poor men vertue,) maketh man unapt atchieve
 actions, require strength many men once: it
 weakeneth endeavour, nourished kept vigor by
 reward.
 
confidence others ignorance marks wisdome and
 kindnesse eloquence, flattery, disposeth men confide them
 it; former seeming wisdome, later seeming
 kindnesse. adde military reputation, disposeth men to
 adhaere, subject men them. two
 former, given caution danger him; later
 gives caution danger others.
 



ignorance naturall causes
 
want science, is, ignorance causes, disposeth, rather
 constraineth man rely advise, authority others. for
 men truth concernes, rely own,
 must rely opinion other, think wiser than
 themselves, see deceive them.
 



want understanding
 
ignorance signification words; is, want of
 understanding, disposeth men take trust, onely truth they
 know not; also errors; more, non-sense them
 trust: neither error, non-sense, can without perfect
 understanding words, detected.
 
proceedeth, men give different names, one and
 thing, difference passions: that
 approve private opinion, call opinion; mislike it,
 haeresie: yet haeresie signifies private opinion; but
 onely greater tincture choler.
 
also proceedeth, men distinguish, without
 study great understanding, one action many men, many
 actions one multitude; example, one action of
 senators rome killing catiline, many actions a
 number senators killing caesar; therefore disposed take
 action people, multitude actions done
 multitude men, led perhaps perswasion one.
 
adhaerence custome, ignorance nature right wrong
 ignorance causes, originall constitution right, equity,
 law, justice, disposeth man make custome example rule
 actions; manner, think unjust it
 hath custome punish; just, impunity and
 approbation whereof can produce example, (as lawyers
 onely use false measure justice barbarously call it) a
 precedent; like little children, rule good and
 evill manners, correction receive parents, and
 masters; save children constant rule, whereas men are
 so; grown strong, stubborn, appeale custome
 reason, reason custome, serves turn; receding
 custome interest requires it, setting themselves
 reason, oft reason them: cause,
 doctrine right wrong, perpetually disputed, by
 pen sword: whereas doctrine lines, figures, is
 so; men care not, subject truth, thing
 crosses mans ambition, profit, lust. doubt not, if
 thing contrary mans right dominion, the
 interest men dominion, three angles triangle
 equall two angles square; doctrine have
 been, disputed, yet burning books geometry,
 suppressed, farre concerned able.
 
adhaerence private men, ignorance causes peace
 ignorance remote causes, disposeth men attribute events, to
 causes immediate, instrumentall: causes
 perceive. hence comes passe, places, men that
 grieved payments publique, discharge anger upon
 publicans, say, farmers, collectors, officers
 publique revenue; adhaere find fault the
 publike government; thereby, engaged themselves
 beyond hope justification, fall also upon supreme authority, for
 feare punishment, shame receiving pardon.
 



credulity ignorance nature
 
ignorance naturall causes disposeth man credulity, as
 believe many times impossibilities: know nothing to
 contrary, may true; unable detect the
 impossibility. credulity, men love hearkened unto in
 company, disposeth lying: ignorance selfe without
 malice, able make man bothe believe lyes, tell them; and
 sometimes also invent them.
 



curiosity know, care future time
 
anxiety future time, disposeth men enquire causes
 things: knowledge them, maketh men better able to
 order present best advantage.
 



naturall religion, same
 
curiosity, love knowledge causes, draws man from
 consideration effect, seek cause; again, cause of
 cause; till necessity must come thought last, that
 cause, whereof former cause, eternall;
 men call god. impossible make profound
 enquiry naturall causes, without enclined thereby believe
 one god eternall; though idea in
 mind, answerable nature. man born blind,
 hearing men talk warming fire, brought
 warm same, may easily conceive, assure himselfe,
 somewhat there, men call fire, cause the
 heat feeles; imagine like; idea of
 mind, see it: also, visible
 things world, admirable order, man may conceive
 cause them, men call god; yet idea,
 image mind.
 
make little, enquiry naturall causes of
 things, yet feare proceeds ignorance selfe,
 hath power much good harm, are
 enclined suppose, feign unto themselves, severall kinds powers
 invisible; stand awe imaginations; time
 distresse invoke them; also time expected good
 successe, give thanks; making creatures own
 fancy, gods. means hath come passe, the
 innumerable variety fancy, men created world innumerable
 sorts gods. feare things invisible, naturall seed
 that, every one calleth religion; that
 worship, feare power otherwise do, superstition.
 
seed religion, observed many; those
 observed it, enclined thereby nourish, dresse,
 forme lawes; adde invention,
 opinion causes future events, thought they
 best able govern others, make unto the
 greatest use powers.
 


chapter xii. religion
 



religion, man onely
 
seeing signes, fruit religion, man onely;
 cause doubt, seed religion, also onely
 man; consisteth peculiar quality, least some
 eminent degree thereof, found living creatures.
 



first, desire knowing causes
 
first, peculiar nature man, inquisitive into
 causes events see, more, lesse; men so
 much, curious search causes good and
 evill fortune.
 



consideration beginning things
 
secondly, upon sight thing hath beginning, think
 also cause, determined begin, it
 did, rather sooner later.
 



observation sequell things
 
thirdly, whereas felicity beasts, enjoying
 quotidian food, ease, lusts; little, no
 foresight time come, want observation, memory
 order, consequence, dependance things see; man
 observeth one event hath produced another; remembreth in
 antecedence consequence; assure himselfe of
 true causes things, (for causes good evill fortune for
 part invisible,) supposes causes them, either such
 fancy suggesteth; trusteth authority men,
 thinks friends, wiser himselfe.
 
naturall cause religion, anxiety time come the
 two first, make anxiety. assured causes all
 things arrived hitherto, shall arrive hereafter; is
 impossible man, continually endeavoureth secure himselfe
 evill feares, procure good desireth, to
 perpetuall solicitude time come; every man,
 especially provident, estate like that
 prometheus. prometheus, (which interpreted, is, prudent
 man,) bound hill caucasus, place large prospect, where,
 eagle feeding liver, devoured day, much was
 repayred night: man, looks far him, in
 care future time, hath heart day long, gnawed by
 feare death, poverty, calamity; repose, pause
 anxiety, sleep.
 



makes fear power invisible things
 
perpetuall feare, alwayes accompanying mankind ignorance of
 causes, dark, must needs object something.
 therefore nothing seen, nothing to
 accuse, either good, evill fortune, power, agent
 invisible: sense perhaps was, old poets
 said, gods first created humane feare: spoken
 gods, (that say, many gods gentiles) is
 true. acknowledging one god eternall, infinite, and
 omnipotent, may easily derived, desire men to
 know causes naturall bodies, severall vertues, and
 operations; feare befall time to
 come. effect hee seeth come passe, reason
 next immediate cause thereof, thence cause
 cause, plonge himselfe profoundly pursuit causes;
 shall last come this, must (as even heathen
 philosophers confessed) one first mover; is, first, an
 eternall cause things; men mean name
 god: without thought fortune; solicitude
 whereof, enclines fear, hinders search the
 causes things; thereby gives occasion feigning as
 many gods, men feigne them.
 



suppose incorporeall
 
matter, substance invisible agents, fancyed;
 naturall cogitation, fall upon conceipt, but
 soule man; soule
 man, substance, appeareth dream,
 one sleepeth; looking-glasse, one awake;
 which, men knowing apparitions nothing else but
 creatures fancy, think reall, externall substances;
 therefore call ghosts; latines called imagines,
 umbrae; thought spirits, is, thin aereall bodies; and
 invisible agents, feared, bee like them; save that
 appear, vanish please. opinion such
 spirits incorporeall, immateriall, never enter the
 mind man nature; because, though men may put together words of
 contradictory signification, spirit, incorporeall; yet they
 can never imagination thing answering them:
 therefore, men meditation, arrive the
 acknowledgement one infinite, omnipotent, eternall god,
 choose rather confesse incomprehensible, their
 understanding; define nature spirit incorporeall, and
 confesse definition unintelligible: give him
 title, dogmatically, intention make divine
 nature understood; piously, honour attributes, of
 significations, remote can grossenesse bodies
 visible.
 



know way effect anything
 
then, way think invisible agents wrought
 effects; say, immediate causes used, in
 bringing things passe, men know call
 causing, (that is, almost men) rule guesse by, but
 observing, remembring seen precede like
 effect time, times before, without seeing the
 antecedent subsequent event, dependance connexion all:
 therefore like things past, expect like things to
 come; hope good evill luck, superstitiously, things that
 part causing it: athenians their
 war lepanto, demand another phormio; pompeian faction their
 warre afrique, another scipio; others done divers other
 occasions since. like manner attribute fortune a
 stander by, lucky unlucky place, words spoken, especially
 name god amongst them; charming, conjuring (the
 leiturgy witches;) insomuch believe, power turn a
 stone bread, bread man, thing, thing.
 



honour honour men
 
thirdly, worship naturally men exhibite powers
 invisible, can other, expressions reverence,
 use towards men; gifts, petitions, thanks, submission
 body, considerate addresses, sober behaviour, premeditated words,
 swearing (that is, assuring one another promises,) invoking
 them. beyond reason suggesteth nothing; leaves either to
 rest there; ceremonies, rely believe to
 wiser themselves.
 



attribute extraordinary events
 
lastly, concerning invisible powers declare men things
 shall hereafter come passe, especially concerning good
 evill fortune generall, good ill successe particular
 undertaking, men naturally stand; save using conjecture
 time come, time past, apt, onely to
 take casuall things, one two encounters, prognostiques
 like encounter ever after, also believe like
 prognostiques men, conceived good
 opinion.
 



foure things, naturall seeds religion
 
foure things, opinion ghosts, ignorance second
 causes, devotion towards men fear, taking things casuall for
 prognostiques, consisteth naturall seed religion; reason
 different fancies, judgements, passions severall men, hath
 grown ceremonies different, used one
 man, part ridiculous another.
 



made different culture
 
seeds received culture two sorts men. one sort
 they, nourished, ordered them, according to
 invention. other, done it, gods commandement, and
 direction: sorts done it, purpose make men
 relyed them, apt obedience, lawes, peace, charity,
 civill society. religion former sort, part
 humane politiques; teacheth part duty earthly kings
 require subjects. religion later sort is
 divine politiques; containeth precepts yeelded
 subjects kingdome god. former sort, all
 founders common-wealths, law-givers gentiles: of
 later sort, abraham, moses, blessed saviour; whom
 derived unto us lawes kingdome god.
 



absurd opinion gentilisme
 
part religion, consisteth opinions concerning
 nature powers invisible, almost nothing a
 name, esteemed amongst gentiles, one place or
 another, god, divell; poets feigned inanimated,
 inhabited, possessed spirit other.
 
unformed matter world, god, name chaos.
 
heaven, ocean, planets, fire, earth, winds, were
 many gods.
 
men, women, bird, crocodile, calf, dogge, snake, onion,
 leeke, deified. besides, filled almost places, with
 spirits called daemons; plains, pan, panises, satyres;
 woods, fawnes, nymphs; sea, tritons, other
 nymphs; every river, fountayn, ghost name, with
 nymphs; every house, lares, familiars; every man, his
 genius; hell, ghosts, spirituall officers, charon, cerberus,
 furies; night time, places larvae, lemures,
 ghosts men deceased, whole kingdome fayries, bugbears.
 also ascribed divinity, built temples meer accidents,
 qualities; time, night, day, peace, concord, love,
 contention, vertue, honour, health, rust, fever, like; which
 prayed for, against, prayed to, were
 ghosts names hanging heads, letting fall, or
 withholding good, evill, for, prayed. they
 invoked also wit, name muses; ignorance,
 name fortune; lust, name cupid; their
 rage, name furies; privy members name of
 priapus; attributed pollutions, incubi, succubae:
 insomuch nothing, poet introduce person
 poem, make either god, divel.
 
authors religion gentiles, observing second
 ground religion, mens ignorance causes; thereby
 aptnesse attribute fortune causes, there
 dependence apparent, took occasion obtrude their
 ignorance, stead second causes, kind second ministeriall
 gods; ascribing cause foecundity, venus; cause arts, to
 apollo; subtilty craft, mercury; tempests stormes,
 aeolus; effects, gods: insomuch was
 amongst heathen almost great variety gods, businesse.
 
worship, naturally men conceived fit bee used
 towards gods, namely oblations, prayers, thanks, rest
 formerly named; legislators gentiles added their
 images, picture, sculpture; ignorant sort,
 (that say, part, generality people,) thinking
 gods whose representation made, really included,
 housed within them, might much stand feare
 them: endowed lands, houses, officers, and
 revenues, set apart humane uses; is, consecrated,
 made holy idols; caverns, groves, woods,
 mountains, whole ilands; attributed them, onely
 shapes, men, beasts, monsters; also the
 faculties, passions men beasts; sense, speech, sex, lust,
 generation, (and onely mixing one another, propagate
 kind gods; also mixing men, women, beget
 mongrill gods, inmates heaven, bacchus, hercules,
 others;) besides, anger, revenge, passions living
 creatures, actions proceeding them, fraud, theft,
 adultery, sodomie, vice may taken effect of
 power, cause pleasure; vices, amongst men are
 taken law, rather honour.
 
lastly, prognostiques time come; naturally, but
 conjectures upon experience time past; supernaturall, divine
 revelation; authors religion gentiles, partly
 upon pretended experience, partly upon pretended revelation, have
 added innumerable superstitious wayes divination; made men
 believe find fortunes, sometimes ambiguous
 senslesse answers priests delphi, delos, ammon, other
 famous oracles; answers, made ambiguous designe, own
 event wayes; absurd intoxicating vapour place,
 frequent sulphurous cavernes: sometimes leaves
 sibills; whose prophecyes (like perhaps nostradamus;
 fragments now extant seem invention later times)
 books reputation time roman republique:
 sometimes insignificant speeches mad-men, supposed to
 possessed divine spirit; possession called
 enthusiasme; kinds foretelling events, accounted
 theomancy, prophecy; sometimes aspect starres their
 nativity; called horoscopy, esteemed part judiciary
 astrology: sometimes hopes feares, called thumomancy,
 presage: sometimes prediction witches, pretended
 conference dead; called necromancy, conjuring, and
 witchcraft; juggling confederate knavery: sometimes in
 casuall flight, feeding birds; called augury: sometimes in
 entrayles sacrificed beast; aruspicina: sometimes
 dreams: sometimes croaking ravens, chattering birds:
 sometimes lineaments face; called metoposcopy;
 palmistry lines hand; casuall words, called
 omina: sometimes monsters, unusuall accidents; ecclipses,
 comets, rare meteors, earthquakes, inundations, uncouth births, the
 like, called portenta ostenta, thought them
 portend, foreshew great calamity come; sometimes, meer
 lottery, crosse pile; counting holes sive; dipping verses
 homer, virgil; innumerable vaine conceipts. so
 easie men drawn believe thing, men have
 gotten credit them; can gentlenesse, dexterity, take
 hold fear, ignorance.
 
designes authors religion heathen therefore
 first founders, legislators common-wealths amongst the
 gentiles, whose ends keep people obedience, and
 peace, places taken care; first, imprint minds a
 beliefe, precepts gave concerning religion, might
 thought proceed device, dictates
 god, spirit; else a
 higher nature mere mortalls, lawes might easily
 received: numa pompilius pretended receive ceremonies he
 instituted amongst romans, nymph egeria: first king
 founder kingdome peru, pretended himselfe wife to
 children sunne: mahomet, set new religion,
 pretended conferences holy ghost, forme dove.
 secondly, care, make believed, same
 things displeasing gods, forbidden the
 lawes. thirdly, prescribe ceremonies, supplications, sacrifices, and
 festivalls, believe, anger gods might
 appeased; ill success war, great contagions sicknesse,
 earthquakes, mans private misery, came anger of
 gods; anger neglect worship, the
 forgetting, mistaking point ceremonies required. and
 though amongst antient romans, men forbidden deny, that
 poets written paines, pleasures this
 life; divers great authority, gravity state have
 harangues openly derided; yet beliefe alwaies more
 cherished, contrary.
 
these, institutions, obtayned order to
 end, (which peace commonwealth,) common
 people misfortunes, laying fault neglect, errour in
 ceremonies, disobedience lawes, the
 lesse apt mutiny governors. entertained with
 pomp, pastime festivalls, publike gomes, made in
 honour gods, needed nothing else bread, keep from
 discontent, murmuring, commotion state. therefore
 romans, conquered greatest part known
 world, made scruple tollerating religion whatsoever the
 city rome selfe; unlesse somthing it, not
 consist civill government; read, religion
 forbidden, jewes; (being peculiar
 kingdome god) thought unlawfull acknowledge subjection any
 mortall king state whatsoever. thus see religion of
 gentiles part policy.
 
true religion, lawes gods kingdome god
 himselfe, supernaturall revelation, planted religion; he
 also made himselfe peculiar kingdome; gave lawes, of
 behaviour towards himselfe; also towards one another; thereby
 kingdome god, policy, lawes civill, part of
 religion; therefore distinction temporall, spirituall
 domination, hath place. true, god king the
 earth: yet may king peculiar, chosen nation. is
 incongruity therein, hath generall command
 whole army, withall peculiar regiment, company
 own. god king earth power: his
 chosen people, king covenant. speake largly the
 kingdome god, nature, covenant, following
 discourse assigned place.
 



causes change religion
 
propagation religion, hard understand
 causes resolution first seeds, or
 principles; opinion deity, powers invisible,
 supernaturall; can never abolished humane nature,
 new religions may againe made spring them, the
 culture men, purpose reputation.
 
seeing formed religion, founded first, upon faith
 multitude hath one person, believe to
 wise man, labour procure happiness, also to
 holy man, god himselfe vouchsafeth declare will
 supernaturally; followeth necessarily, the
 goverment religion, shall come either wisedome those
 men, sincerity, love suspected; shall
 unable shew probable token divine revelation; the
 religion desire uphold, must suspected likewise; and
 (without feare civill sword) contradicted rejected.
 



injoyning beleefe impossibilities
 
taketh away reputation wisedome, formeth
 religion, addeth allready formed, enjoyning
 beliefe contradictories: parts contradiction
 possibly true: therefore enjoyne beliefe them,
 argument ignorance; detects author that; and
 discredits things else shall propound revelation
 supernaturall: revelation man may indeed many things
 above, nothing naturall reason.
 



contrary religion establish
 
taketh away reputation sincerity, doing, or
 saying things, appeare signes, require
 men believe, believed themselves; doings,
 sayings therefore called scandalous, stumbling
 blocks, make men fall way religion: injustice,
 cruelty, prophanesse, avarice, luxury. can believe, he
 doth ordinarily actions, proceed these
 rootes, believeth invisible power feared, he
 affrighteth men withall, lesser faults?
 
taketh away reputation love, detected of
 private ends: beliefe require others, conduceth or
 seemeth conduce acquiring dominion, riches, dignity, or
 secure pleasure, onely, specially. men
 reap benefit themselves, thought own
 sakes, love others
 



want testimony miracles
 
lastly, testimony men can render divine calling, can no
 other, operation miracles; true prophecy, (which also is
 miracle;) extraordinary felicity. therefore, points
 religion, received miracles;
 added such, approve calling some
 miracle, obtain greater beliefe, custome, lawes of
 places, educated, wrought them. as
 naturall things, men judgement require naturall signes,
 arguments; supernaturall things, require signes
 supernaturall, (which miracles,) consent inwardly, and
 hearts.
 
causes weakening mens faith, manifestly appear
 examples following. first, example children
 israel; moses, approved calling by
 miracles, happy conduct egypt, absent but
 40 dayes, revolted worship true god, recommended to
 him; setting (exod.32 1,2) golden calfe god,
 relapsed idolatry egyptians; been
 lately delivered. again, moses, aaron, joshua, that
 generation seen great works god israel, (judges
 2 11) dead; another generation arose, served baal. that
 miracles fayling, faith also failed.
 
again, sons samuel, (1 sam.8.3) constituted their
 father judges bersabee, received bribes, judged unjustly, the
 people israel refused god king, other
 manner king people; therefore cryed to
 samuel, choose king manner nations. that
 justice fayling, faith also fayled: insomuch, deposed god,
 reigning them.
 
whereas planting christian religion, oracles ceased
 parts roman empire, number christians encreased
 wonderfully every day, every place, preaching the
 apostles, evangelists; great part successe, may reasonably
 attributed, contempt, priests gentiles
 time, brought themselves, uncleannesse, avarice,
 jugling princes. also religion church rome,
 partly, cause abolished england, many other
 parts christendome; insomuch, fayling vertue the
 pastors, maketh faith faile people: partly bringing
 philosophy, doctrine aristotle religion, the
 schoole-men; whence arose many contradictions, and
 absurdities, brought clergy reputation ignorance,
 fraudulent intention; enclined people revolt them,
 either will princes, france, holland;
 will, england.
 
lastly, amongst points church rome declared necessary for
 salvation, many, manifestly advantage pope,
 spirituall subjects, residing territories other
 christian princes, mutuall emulation those
 princes, might without warre, trouble, exclude forraign
 authority, easily excluded england. is
 see, whose benefit conduceth, it
 believed, king hath authority christ, unlesse a
 bishop crown him? king, priest, marry? that
 whether prince born lawfull marriage, not, must judged by
 authority rome? subjects may freed alleageance,
 court rome, king judged heretique? king
 (as chilperique france) may deposed pope (as pope zachary,)
 cause; kingdome given one subjects? the
 clergy, regulars, country soever, shall exempt the
 jurisdiction king, cases criminall? see, to
 whose profit redound fees private masses, vales purgatory;
 signes private interest, enough mortifie most
 lively faith, (as sayd) civill magistrate, custome not
 sustain it, opinion sanctity, wisdome,
 probity teachers? may attribute changes
 religion world, one cause; is,
 unpleasing priests; onely amongst catholiques, even in
 church hath presumed reformation.
 


chapter xiii. naturall condition mankind,
 concerning felicity, misery
 

nature hath made men equall, faculties body, mind; as
 though bee found one man sometimes manifestly stronger
 body, quicker mind another; yet reckoned
 together, difference man, man, considerable,
 one man can thereupon claim himselfe benefit, which
 another may pretend, well he. strength body,
 weakest strength enough kill strongest, either secret
 machination, confederacy others, danger
 himselfe.
 
faculties mind, (setting aside arts grounded
 upon words, especially skill proceeding upon generall, and
 infallible rules, called science; have, few
 things; native faculty, born us; attained,
 (as prudence,) look somewhat els,) find yet greater
 equality amongst men, strength. prudence, but
 experience; equall time, equally bestowes men, those
 things equally apply unto. may perhaps make
 equality incredible, vain conceipt ones owne wisdome,
 almost men think greater degree, the
 vulgar; is, men themselves, others, by
 fame, concurring themselves, approve. the
 nature men, howsoever may acknowledge many others be
 witty, eloquent, learned; yet will hardly
 believe many wise themselves: see wit
 hand, mens distance. proveth rather men
 point equall, unequall. ordinarily a
 greater signe equall distribution thing, every
 man contented share.
 



equality proceeds diffidence
 
equality ability, ariseth equality hope attaining
 ends. therefore two men desire thing, which
 neverthelesse enjoy, become enemies; the
 way end, (which principally owne conservation, and
 sometimes delectation only,) endeavour destroy, subdue one
 other. hence comes passe, invader hath
 feare, mans single power; one plant, sow,
 build, possesse convenient seat, others may probably expected to
 come prepared forces united, dispossesse, deprive him, not
 fruit labour, also life, liberty. and
 invader like danger another.
 



diffidence warre
 
diffidence one another, way man to
 secure himselfe, reasonable, anticipation; is, force, or
 wiles, master persons men can, long, till see no
 power great enough endanger him: his
 conservation requireth, generally allowed. also there
 some, taking pleasure contemplating power in
 acts conquest, pursue farther security
 requires; others, otherwise glad ease within
 modest bounds, invasion increase power, would
 able, long time, standing defence, subsist.
 consequence, augmentation dominion men, being
 necessary mans conservation, allowed him.
 
againe, men pleasure, (but contrary great deale of
 griefe) keeping company, power able over-awe
 all. every man looketh companion value him, at
 rate sets upon himselfe: upon signes contempt,
 undervaluing, naturally endeavours, far dares (which amongst
 common power, keep quiet, far enough
 make destroy other,) extort greater value his
 contemners, dommage; others, example.
 
nature man, find three principall causes of
 quarrel. first, competition; secondly, diffidence; thirdly, glory.
 
first, maketh men invade gain; second, safety; and
 third, reputation. first use violence, make themselves
 masters mens persons, wives, children, cattell; second,
 defend them; third, trifles, word, smile, different
 opinion, signe undervalue, either direct their
 persons, reflexion kindred, friends, nation,
 profession, name.
 



civil states, alwayes warre every one every
 one
 
hereby manifest, time men live without common
 power keep awe, condition is
 called warre; warre, every man, every man.
 warre, consisteth battell onely, act fighting; but
 tract time, wherein will contend battell is
 sufficiently known: therefore notion time, be
 considered nature warre; nature weather.
 nature foule weather, lyeth showre two of
 rain; inclination thereto many dayes together: the
 nature war, consisteth actuall fighting; known
 disposition thereto, time assurance the
 contrary. time peace.
 



incommodites war
 
whatsoever therefore consequent time warre, every man
 enemy every man; consequent time, wherein men
 live without security, strength, their
 invention shall furnish withall. condition, is
 place industry; fruit thereof uncertain; and
 consequently culture earth; navigation, use the
 commodities may imported sea; commodious building; no
 instruments moving, removing things require much force;
 knowledge face earth; account time; arts; no
 letters; society; worst all, continuall feare, and
 danger violent death; life man, solitary, poore, nasty,
 brutish, short.
 
may seem strange man, well weighed things;
 nature thus dissociate, render men apt invade,
 destroy one another: may therefore, trusting this
 inference, made passions, desire perhaps same
 confirmed experience. let therefore consider himselfe, when
 taking journey, armes himselfe, seeks go well accompanied;
 going sleep, locks dores; even house he
 locks chests; knows bee lawes, publike
 officers, armed, revenge injuries shall bee done him; what
 opinion fellow subjects, rides armed; his
 fellow citizens, locks dores; children, and
 servants, locks chests. much accuse
 mankind actions, words? neither us accuse
 mans nature it. desires, passions man, in
 sin. actions, proceed those
 passions, till know law forbids them; till lawes be
 made know: can law made, till agreed
 upon person shall make it.
 
may peradventure thought, never time, nor
 condition warre this; believe never generally so,
 world: many places, live now.
 savage people many places america, except government
 small families, concord whereof dependeth naturall lust, have
 government all; live day brutish manner, as
 said before. howsoever, may perceived manner life there
 be, common power feare; manner of
 life, men formerly lived peacefull government,
 use degenerate into, civill warre.
 
though never time, wherein particular men in
 condition warre one another; yet times, kings, and
 persons soveraigne authority, independency, are
 continuall jealousies, state posture gladiators;
 weapons pointing, eyes fixed one another;
 is, forts, garrisons, guns upon frontiers their
 kingdomes; continuall spyes upon neighbours; a
 posture war. uphold thereby, industry their
 subjects; follow it, misery, accompanies
 liberty particular men.
 



warre, nothing unjust
 
warre every man every man, also consequent;
 nothing can unjust. notions right wrong, justice and
 injustice place. common power, is
 law: law, injustice. force, fraud, warre the
 two cardinall vertues. justice, injustice none faculties
 neither body, mind. were, might man that
 alone world, well senses, passions. they
 qualities, relate men society, solitude. is
 consequent also condition, propriety, no
 dominion, mine thine distinct; onely every mans
 can get; long, can keep it. thus much
 ill condition, man meer nature actually placed in;
 though possibility come it, consisting partly the
 passions, partly reason.
 



passions incline men peace
 
passions encline men peace, feare death; desire of
 things necessary commodious living; hope their
 industry obtain them. reason suggesteth convenient articles of
 peace, upon men may drawn agreement. articles, are
 they, otherwise called lawes nature: whereof shall
 speak particularly, two following chapters.
 


chapter xiv. first second naturall lawes, contracts
 



right nature what
 
right nature, writers commonly call jus naturale, the
 liberty man hath, use power, will himselfe, for
 preservation nature; say, life;
 consequently, thing, judgement, and
 reason, hee shall conceive aptest means thereunto.
 



liberty what
 
liberty, understood, according proper signification the
 word, absence externall impediments: impediments, may oft
 take away part mans power hee would; hinder
 using power left him, according judgement, and
 reason shall dictate him.
 



law nature what
 
law nature, (lex naturalis,) precept, generall rule,
 found reason, man forbidden do, that, which
 destructive life, taketh away means preserving the
 same; omit, that, thinketh may best preserved.
 though speak subject, use confound jus, and
 lex, right law; yet distinguished; right,
 consisteth liberty do, forbeare; whereas law, determineth,
 bindeth one them: law, right, differ much,
 obligation, liberty; one matter are
 inconsistent.
 



naturally every man right everything
 
condition man, (as hath declared the
 precedent chapter) condition warre every one every
 one; case every one governed reason; there
 nothing can make use of, may help unto him, in
 preserving life enemyes; followeth, a
 condition, every man right every thing; even one anothers
 body. therefore, long naturall right every man to
 every thing endureth, can security man, (how strong
 wise soever be,) living time, nature ordinarily
 alloweth men live.
 



fundamental law nature
 
consequently precept, generall rule reason, "that
 every man, endeavour peace, farre hope of
 obtaining it; obtain it, may seek, use,
 helps, advantages warre." first branch, rule,
 containeth first, fundamentall law nature; is, "to seek
 peace, follow it." second, summe right nature;
 is, "by means can, defend selves."
 



second law nature
 
fundamentall law nature, men commanded to
 endeavour peace, derived second law; "that man willing,
 others too, farre-forth, peace, defence of
 himselfe shall think necessary, lay right all
 things; contented much liberty men, as
 allow men himselfe." long every man
 holdeth right, thing liketh; long men in
 condition warre. men will lay right,
 well he; reason one, devest himselfe
 his: expose himselfe prey, (which man bound
 to) rather dispose himselfe peace. law the
 gospell; "whatsoever require others you, do
 ye them." law men, "quod tibi feiri non vis, alteri
 ne feceris."
 



lay right
 
lay downe mans right thing, devest himselfe the
 liberty, hindring another benefit right the
 same. renounceth, passeth away right, giveth to
 man right before; nothing
 every man right nature: onely standeth of
 way, may enjoy originall right, without hindrance
 him; without hindrance another. effect which
 redoundeth one man, another mans defect right, much
 diminution impediments use right originall.
 



renouncing (or) transferring right what; obligation duty justice
 
right layd aside, either simply renouncing it; transferring
 another. simply renouncing; cares the
 benefit thereof redoundeth. transferring; intendeth the
 benefit thereof certain person, persons. man hath
 either manner abandoned, granted away right; said
 obliged, bound, hinder those, right is
 granted, abandoned, benefit it: ought, it
 duty, make voyd voluntary act own: such
 hindrance injustice, injury, sine jure; right being
 renounced, transferred. injury, injustice, in
 controversies world, somewhat like that, the
 disputations scholers called absurdity. called
 absurdity, contradict one maintained beginning: in
 world, called injustice, injury, voluntarily undo that,
 beginning voluntarily done. way man
 either simply renounceth, transferreth right, declaration,
 signification, voluntary sufficient signe, signes,
 doth renounce, transferre; hath renounced, or
 transferred same, accepteth it. signes are
 either words onely, actions onely; (as happeneth often)
 words actions. bonds, men are
 bound, obliged: bonds, strength, own
 nature, (for nothing easily broken mans word,) from
 feare evill consequence upon rupture.
 



rights alienable
 
whensoever man transferreth right, renounceth it; either
 consideration right reciprocally transferred himselfe; or
 good hopeth thereby. voluntary act:
 voluntary acts every man, object good to
 himselfe. therefore rights, man can be
 understood words, signes, abandoned, or
 transferred. first man lay right resisting them,
 assault force, take away life; be
 understood ayme thereby, good himselfe. may be
 sayd wounds, chayns, imprisonment; is
 benefit consequent patience; patience of
 suffering another wounded, imprisoned: also man
 tell, seeth men proceed violence, whether
 intend death not. lastly motive, end which
 renouncing, transferring right introduced, nothing
 else security mans person, life, means of
 preserving life, weary it. therefore man by
 words, signes, seem despoyle himselfe end, which
 signes intended; understood meant
 it, will; ignorant words
 actions interpreted.
 



contract what
 
mutuall transferring right, men call contract.
 
difference, transferring right thing; and
 transferring, tradition, is, delivery thing selfe. for
 thing may delivered together translation right;
 buying selling ready mony; exchange goods, or
 lands: may delivered time after.
 



covenant what
 
again, one contractors, may deliver thing contracted on
 part, leave perform part determinate
 time after, mean time trusted; contract on
 part, called pact, covenant: parts may contract now,
 performe hereafter: cases, performe time
 come, trusted, performance called keeping promise, or
 faith; fayling performance (if voluntary) violation of
 faith.
 



free-gift
 
transferring right, mutuall; one parties
 transferreth, hope gain thereby friendship, service from
 another, friends; hope gain reputation of
 charity, magnanimity; deliver mind pain of
 compassion; hope reward heaven; contract, but
 gift, freegift, grace: words signifie one thing.
 



signes contract expresse
 
signes contract, either expresse, inference. expresse, are
 words spoken understanding signifie; words
 either time present, past; as, give, grant, have
 given, granted, will yours: future;
 as, will give, will grant; words future, called
 promise.
 



signes contract inference
 
signes inference, sometimes consequence words; sometimes
 consequence silence; sometimes consequence actions;
 sometimes consequence forbearing action: generally signe
 inference, contract, whatsoever sufficiently argues the
 will contractor.
 



free gift passeth words present past
 
words alone, time come, contain bare promise,
 insufficient signe free-gift therefore obligatory.
 time come, as, morrow will give, they
 signe given yet, consequently right not
 transferred, remaineth till transferre act. but
 words time present, past, as, "i given, do
 give delivered morrow," morrows right given away
 day; vertue words, though no
 argument will. great difference the
 signification words, volos hoc tuum esse cras, cros dabo;
 "i will thine morrow," and, "i will
 give thee morrow:" word will, former manner
 speech, signifies act will present; later, it
 signifies promise act will come: therefore the
 former words, present, transferre future right; the
 later, future, transferre nothing. other
 signes will transferre right, besides words; then, though
 gift free, yet may right understood passe words of
 future: man propound prize comes first the
 end race, gift free; though words the
 future, yet right passeth: words be
 understood, let runne.
 
signes contract words past, present, future in
 contracts, right passeth, onely words time
 present, past; also future; all
 contract mutuall translation, change right; therefore he
 promiseth onely, hath already received benefit for
 promiseth, understood intended right
 passe: unlesse content words so
 understood, performed part first. and
 cause, buying, selling, acts contract, a
 promise equivalent covenant; therefore obligatory.
 



merit what
 
performeth first case contract, said merit
 receive performance other; hath
 due. also prize propounded many, given
 onely winneth; mony thrown amongst many, enjoyed
 catch it; though free gift; yet win, or
 catch, merit, due. right is
 transferred propounding prize, throwing the
 mony; though determined whom, event the
 contention. two sorts merit, this
 difference, contract, merit vertue power, the
 contractors need; case free gift, enabled to
 merit onely benignity giver; contract, merit the
 contractors hand hee depart right; case of
 gift, merit giver part right; that
 parted it, mine, rather anothers.
 think meaning distinction schooles,
 meritum congrui, meritum condigni. god almighty, having
 promised paradise men (hoodwinkt carnall desires,) that
 can walk world according precepts, limits
 prescribed him; say, shall walk, shall merit paradise
 ex congruo. man can demand right it, own
 righteousnesse, power himselfe, free grace of
 god onely; say, man can merit paradise ex condigno. say,
 think meaning distinction; disputers not
 agree upon signification termes art, longer it
 serves turn; will affirme thing meaning:
 onely say; gift given indefinitely, prize be
 contended for, winneth meriteth, may claime prize as
 due.
 



covenants mutuall trust, invalid
 
covenant made, wherein neither parties performe
 presently, trust one another; condition meer nature,
 (which condition warre every man every man,) upon
 reasonable suspition, voyd; common power set
 bothe, right force sufficient compell performance;
 voyd. performeth first, assurance other
 will performe after; bonds words weak bridle
 mens ambition, avarice, anger, passions, without feare of
 coerceive power; condition meer nature, all
 men equall, judges justnesse fears cannot
 possibly supposed. therefore performeth first, does
 betray himselfe enemy; contrary right (he can never
 abandon) defending life, means living.
 
civill estate, power set constrain
 otherwise violate faith, feare more
 reasonable; cause, covenant perform
 first, obliged do.
 
cause feare, maketh covenant invalid, must be
 alwayes something arising covenant made; new fact,
 signe will performe; else make the
 covenant voyd. hinder man promising,
 admitted hindrance performing.
 



right end, containeth right means
 
transferreth right, transferreth means enjoying it,
 farre lyeth power. selleth land, understood
 transferre herbage, whatsoever growes upon it; can he
 sells mill turn away stream drives it. that
 give man right government soveraignty, understood
 give right levying mony maintain souldiers; of
 appointing magistrates administration justice.
 



covenant beasts
 
make covenant bruit beasts, impossible; not
 understanding speech, understand not, accept any
 translation right; can translate right another; and
 without mutuall acceptation, covenant.
 



god without speciall revelation
 
make covenant god, impossible, mediation such
 god speaketh to, either revelation supernaturall, his
 lieutenants govern him, name; otherwise we
 know whether covenants accepted, not. therefore they
 vow thing contrary law nature, vow vain; being
 thing unjust pay vow. thing commanded the
 law nature, vow, law binds them.
 



covenant, possible future
 
matter, subject covenant, alwayes something falleth
 deliberation; (for covenant, act will; to
 say act, last act, deliberation;) therefore alwayes
 understood something come; judged possible him
 covenanteth, performe.
 
therefore, promise known impossible, no
 covenant. prove impossible afterwards, was
 thought possible, covenant valid, bindeth, (though the
 thing selfe,) yet value; or, also impossible, to
 unfeigned endeavour performing much possible; to
 man can obliged.
 



covenants made voyd
 
men freed covenants two wayes; performing; being
 forgiven. performance, naturall end obligation; and
 forgivenesse, restitution liberty; retransferring of
 right, obligation consisted.
 



covenants extorted feare valide
 
covenants entred fear, condition meer nature, are
 obligatory. example, covenant pay ransome, service for
 life, enemy; bound it. contract, wherein
 one receiveth benefit life; receive mony,
 service it; consequently, law (as the
 condition, meer nature) forbiddeth performance, covenant
 valid. therefore prisoners warre, trusted payment of
 ransome, obliged pay it; weaker prince, make a
 disadvantageous peace stronger, feare; bound keep
 it; unlesse (as hath sayd before) ariseth new, just
 cause feare, renew war. even common-wealths, be
 forced redeem selfe theefe promising mony, am
 bound pay it, till civill law discharge me. whatsoever may
 lawfully without obligation, may lawfully covenant do
 feare: lawfully covenant, lawfully break.
 



former covenant one, makes voyd later another
 
former covenant, makes voyd later. man hath passed away
 right one man day, hath passe morrow another:
 therefore later promise passeth right, null.
 



mans covenant defend himselfe, voyd
 
covenant defend selfe force, force, alwayes voyd.
 (as shewed before) man can transferre, lay his
 right save himselfe death, wounds, imprisonment, (the
 avoyding whereof onely end laying right,)
 therefore promise resisting force, covenant
 transferreth right; obliging. though man may covenant
 thus, "unlesse so, so, kill me;" covenant thus "unless
 so, so, will resist you, come kill me." for
 man nature chooseth lesser evill, danger death in
 resisting; rather greater, certain present death
 resisting. granted true men, in
 lead criminals execution, prison, armed men,
 notwithstanding criminals consented law, which
 condemned.
 



man obliged accuse himselfe
 
covenant accuse ones selfe, without assurance pardon, is
 likewise invalide. condition nature, every man is
 judge, place accusation: civill state, the
 accusation followed punishment; force, man is
 obliged resist. also true, accusation of
 those, whose condemnation man falls misery; father,
 wife, benefactor. testimony accuser, not
 willingly given, praesumed corrupted nature; therefore
 received: mans testimony credited,
 bound give it. also accusations upon torture, to
 reputed testimonies. torture used means of
 conjecture, light, examination, search truth;
 case confessed, tendeth ease is
 tortured; informing torturers: therefore ought
 credit sufficient testimony: whether deliver
 himselfe true, false accusation, right of
 preserving life.
 



end oath; forme oath
 
force words, (as formerly noted) weak hold
 men performance covenants; mans nature, but
 two imaginable helps strengthen it. either feare
 consequence breaking word; glory, pride in
 appearing need breake it. later generosity too
 rarely found presumed on, especially pursuers wealth,
 command, sensuall pleasure; greatest part mankind.
 passion reckoned upon, fear; whereof two very
 generall objects: one, power spirits invisible; other, the
 power men shall therein offend. two, though the
 former greater power, yet feare later commonly
 greater feare. feare former every man, own
 religion: hath place nature man civill society.
 later hath so; least place enough, keep men their
 promises; condition meer nature, inequality of
 power discerned, event battell. the
 time civill society, interruption thereof warre, there
 nothing can strengthen covenant peace agreed on, the
 temptations avarice, ambition, lust, strong desire, the
 feare invisible power, every one worship god; and
 feare revenger perfidy. therefore can done
 two men subject civill power, put one another
 swear god feareth: swearing oath, forme of
 speech, added promise; promiseth, signifieth, that
 unlesse performe, renounceth mercy god, calleth to
 vengeance himselfe. heathen forme, "let jupiter
 kill else, kill beast." forme, "i shall thus,
 thus, help god." this, rites ceremonies,
 every one useth religion, feare breaking
 faith might greater.
 



oath, god
 
appears, oath taken according forme, or
 rite, his, sweareth, vain; oath: no
 swearing thing swearer thinks god. though men
 sometimes used swear kings, feare, flattery; yet
 thereby understood, attributed divine
 honour. swearing unnecessarily god, prophaning his
 name: swearing things, men common discourse, is
 swearing, impious custome, gotten much vehemence of
 talking.
 



oath addes nothing obligation
 
appears also, oath addes nothing obligation. a
 covenant, lawfull, binds sight god, without oath,
 much it; unlawfull, bindeth all; though be
 confirmed oath.
 


chapter xv. lawes nature
 



third law nature, justice
 
law nature, obliged transferre to
 another, rights, retained, hinder peace mankind,
 followeth third; this, men performe their
 covenants made: without which, covenants vain, empty
 words; right men things remaining, wee still
 condition warre.
 



justice injustice what
 
law nature, consisteth fountain originall of
 justice. covenant hath preceded, hath right been
 transferred, every man right every thing; consequently,
 action can unjust. covenant made, break it
 unjust: definition injustice, not
 performance covenant. whatsoever unjust, just.
 
justice propriety begin constitution common-wealth
 covenants mutuall trust, feare not
 performance either part, (as hath said former chapter,)
 invalid; though originall justice making covenants;
 yet injustice actually can none, till cause feare
 taken away; men naturall condition warre,
 done. therefore names just, unjust can have
 place, must coercive power, compell men equally to
 performance covenants, terrour punishment,
 greater benefit expect breach covenant;
 make good propriety, mutuall contract men acquire,
 recompence universall right abandon: power there
 none erection common-wealth. also be
 gathered ordinary definition justice schooles: for
 say, "justice constant will giving every man his
 own." therefore own, is, propriety, there
 injustice; coerceive power erected, is,
 common-wealth, propriety; men having
 right things: therefore common-wealth, there
 nothing unjust. nature justice, consisteth keeping
 valid covenants: validity covenants begins with
 constitution civill power, sufficient compell men keep
 them: also propriety begins.
 



justice contrary reason
 
foole hath sayd heart, thing justice;
 sometimes also tongue; seriously alleaging, every mans
 conservation, contentment, committed care, there
 reason, every man might thought conduced
 thereunto; therefore also make, make; keep, keep
 covenants, reason, conduced ones benefit.
 therein deny, covenants; are
 sometimes broken, sometimes kept; breach may
 called injustice, observance justice: he
 questioneth, whether injustice, taking away feare god, (for the
 foole hath said heart god,) may sometimes
 stand reason, dictateth every man good; and
 particularly then, conduceth benefit, shall put a
 man condition, neglect onely dispraise, revilings,
 also power men. kingdome god gotten by
 violence; gotten unjust violence? it
 reason get it, impossible receive hurt by
 it? reason, justice; else
 justice approved good. reasoning this,
 succesfull wickednesse hath obtained name vertue; that
 things disallowed violation faith; yet have
 allowed it, getting kingdome. heathen
 believed, saturn deposed jupiter, believed
 neverthelesse jupiter avenger injustice: somewhat
 like piece law cokes commentaries litleton; he
 sayes, right heire crown attainted treason; yet the
 crown shall descend him, eo instante atteynder voyd; from
 instances man will prone inferre; heire
 apparent kingdome, shall kill possession, though his
 father; may call injustice, name will; yet
 can never reason, seeing voluntary actions of
 men tend benefit themselves; actions most
 reasonable, conduce ends. specious reasoning is
 nevertheless false.
 
question promises mutuall, security
 performance either side; civill power erected
 parties promising; promises covenants: but
 either one parties performed already; there
 power make performe; question whether be
 reason, is, benefit performe,
 not. say reason. manifestation
 whereof, consider; first, man doth thing, which
 notwithstanding thing can foreseen, reckoned on, tendeth to
 destruction, howsoever accident expect,
 arriving may turne benefit; yet events make it
 reasonably wisely done. secondly, condition warre,
 wherein every man every man, want common power keep them
 awe, enemy, man can hope strength,
 wit, defend himselfe destruction, without help
 confederates; every one expects defence the
 confederation, one else does: therefore declares
 thinks reason deceive help him, can reason expect
 means safety, can single
 power. therefore breaketh covenant, consequently
 declareth thinks may reason so, received
 society, unite peace defence, but
 errour receive him; received, be
 retayned it, without seeing danger errour; errours
 man reasonably reckon upon means security; and
 therefore left, cast society, perisheth; he
 live society, errours men, not
 foresee, reckon upon; consequently reason his
 preservation; so, men contribute destruction,
 forbear onely ignorance good themselves.
 
instance gaining secure perpetuall felicity of
 heaven, way; frivolous: one way imaginable;
 breaking, keeping covenant.
 
instance attaining soveraignty rebellion; is
 manifest, though event follow, yet reasonably
 expected, rather contrary; gaining so,
 others taught gain like manner, attempt thereof
 reason. justice therefore, say, keeping of
 covenant, rule reason, forbidden thing
 destructive life; consequently law nature.
 
proceed further; will law nature,
 rules conduce preservation mans life on
 earth; attaining eternall felicity death; to
 think breach covenant may conduce; consequently
 just reasonable; (such think work merit
 kill, depose, rebell against, soveraigne power constituted
 consent.) naturall
 knowledge mans estate death; much lesse reward is
 given breach faith; onely beliefe grounded upon
 mens saying, know supernaturally, know
 those, knew them, knew others, knew supernaturally;
 breach faith called precept reason, nature.
 



covenants discharged vice person made
 
others, allow law nature, keeping faith, do
 neverthelesse make exception certain persons; heretiques, and
 use performe covenant others: also is
 reason. fault man, sufficient discharge
 covenant made; reason sufficient to
 hindred making it.
 



justice men, justice actions what
 
names just, unjust, attributed men, signifie
 one thing; attributed actions, another. they
 attributed men, signifie conformity, inconformity of
 manners, reason. attributed actions, they
 signifie conformity, inconformity reason, manners, or
 manner life, particular actions. just man therefore, he
 taketh care can, actions may just: and
 unjust man, neglecteth it. men often
 language stiled names righteous, unrighteous; then
 just, unjust; though meaning same. therefore righteous
 man, lose title, one, unjust actions, that
 proceed sudden passion, mistake things, persons: does
 unrighteous man, lose character, actions, does,
 forbeares do, feare: will framed the
 justice, apparant benefit do. which
 gives humane actions relish justice, certain noblenesse
 gallantnesse courage, (rarely found,) man scorns to
 beholding contentment life, fraud, breach of
 promise. justice manners, meant, where
 justice called vertue; injustice vice.
 
justice actions denominates men, just, guiltlesse;
 injustice same, (which also called injury,) gives them
 name guilty.
 



justice manners, justice actions
 
again, injustice manners, disposition, aptitude to
 injurie; injustice proceed act; without
 supposing individuall person injured. injustice an
 action, (that say injury,) supposeth individuall person
 injured; namely him, covenant made: therefore many
 times injury received one man, dammage redoundeth
 another. master commandeth servant give mony a
 stranger; done, injury done master, whom
 covenanted obey; dammage redoundeth the
 stranger, obligation; therefore injure
 him. also common-wealths, private men may remit one another
 debts; robberies violences, whereby are
 endammaged; detaining debt, injury themselves;
 robbery violence, injuries person the
 common-wealth.
 



nothing done man, consent can injury
 
whatsoever done man, conformable will signified to
 doer, injury him. doeth it, hath passed
 away originall right please, antecedent
 covenant, breach covenant; therefore injury done
 him. have; will done signified, a
 release covenant; injury done him.
 



justice commutative, distributive
 
justice actions, writers divided commutative, and
 distributive; former say consisteth proportion
 arithmeticall; later proportion geometricall. commutative
 therefore, place equality value things contracted
 for; distributive, distribution equall benefit, men of
 equall merit. injustice sell dearer buy; to
 give man merits. value things contracted
 for, measured appetite contractors: therefore the
 just value, contented give. merit (besides
 covenant, performance one part, meriteth
 performance part, falls justice commutative,
 distributive,) due justice; rewarded grace
 onely. therefore distinction, sense wherein useth to
 expounded, right. speak properly, commutative justice,
 justice contractor; is, performance covenant,
 buying, selling; hiring, letting hire; lending, and
 borrowing; exchanging, bartering, acts contract.
 
distributive justice, justice arbitrator; say,
 act defining just. wherein, (being trusted that
 make arbitrator,) performe trust, said distribute
 every man own: indeed just distribution, may
 called (though improperly) distributive justice; properly
 equity; also law nature, shall shewn due place.
 



fourth law nature, gratitude
 
justice dependeth antecedent covenant; gratitude depend
 antecedent grace; say, antecedent free-gift: the
 fourth law nature; may conceived forme, "that man
 receiveth benefit another meer grace, endeavour he
 giveth it, reasonable cause repent good
 will." man giveth, intention good himselfe;
 gift voluntary; voluntary acts, object to
 every man good; men see shall frustrated,
 will beginning benevolence, trust; consequently of
 mutuall help; reconciliation one man another; therefore
 remain still condition war; contrary to
 first fundamentall law nature, commandeth men seek
 peace. breach law, called ingratitude; hath same
 relation grace, injustice hath obligation covenant.
 



fifth, mutuall accommodation, compleasance
 
fifth law nature, compleasance; say, "that every
 man strive accommodate himselfe rest." understanding
 whereof, may consider, mens aptnesse society;
 diversity nature, rising diversity affections; not
 unlike see stones brought together building an
 aedifice. stone asperity, irregularity of
 figure, takes room others, selfe fills; for
 hardnesse, easily made plain, thereby hindereth the
 building, builders cast away unprofitable, troublesome:
 also, man asperity nature, will strive retain those
 things himselfe superfluous, others necessary; and
 stubbornness passions, corrected, be
 left, cast society, combersome thereunto. seeing every
 man, onely right, also necessity nature, supposed
 endeavour can, obtain necessary his
 conservation; shall oppose himselfe it, things
 superfluous, guilty warre thereupon follow; and
 therefore doth that, contrary fundamentall law of
 nature, commandeth seek peace. observers law,
 may called sociable, (the latines call commodi;) contrary,
 stubborn, insociable, froward, intractable.
 



sixth, facility pardon
 
sixth law nature this, "that upon caution future time,
 man pardon offences past repenting, desire
 it." pardon, nothing granting peace; though granted
 persevere hostility, peace, feare; yet
 granted give caution future time, signe an
 aversion peace; therefore contrary law nature.
 



seventh, revenges, men respect onely future good
 
seventh is, " revenges, (that is, retribution evil for
 evil,) men look greatnesse evill past, the
 greatnesse good follow." whereby forbidden inflict
 punishment designe, correction offender,
 direction others. law consequent next before
 it, commandeth pardon, upon security future time. besides,
 revenge without respect example, profit come, a
 triumph, glorying hurt another, tending end; (for the
 end alwayes somewhat come;) glorying end, vain-glory,
 contrary reason; hurt without reason, tendeth the
 introduction warre; law nature; is
 commonly stiled name cruelty.
 



eighth, contumely
 
signes hatred, contempt, provoke fight;
 insomuch men choose rather hazard life, be
 revenged; may eighth place, law nature set this
 precept, "that man deed, word, countenance, gesture, declare
 hatred, contempt another." breach law, commonly
 called contumely.
 



ninth, pride
 
question better man, place condition of
 meer nature; where, (as shewn before,) men equall. the
 inequallity now is, introduced lawes civill. know
 aristotle first booke politiques, foundation of
 doctrine, maketh men nature, worthy command, meaning
 wiser sort (such thought himselfe philosophy;)
 others serve, (meaning strong bodies, not
 philosophers he;) master servant introduced by
 consent men, difference wit; against
 reason; also experience. foolish,
 rather governe themselves, governed others:
 wise conceit, contend force, who
 distrust owne wisdome, alwaies, often, almost any
 time, get victory. nature therefore made men equall, that
 equalitie acknowledged; nature made men unequall;
 yet men think equall, will enter into
 conditions peace, upon equall termes, equalitie must be
 admitted. therefore ninth law nature, put this, "that
 every man acknowledge equall nature." breach of
 precept pride.
 



tenth arrogance
 
law, dependeth another, "that entrance conditions of
 peace, man require reserve himselfe right, not
 content reserved every one rest." necessary
 men seek peace, lay certaine rights nature; that
 say, libertie list: necessarie
 mans life, retaine some; right governe owne bodies;
 enjoy aire, water, motion, waies go place place; all
 things else without man live, live well. in
 case, making peace, men require themselves, that
 granted others, contrary
 precedent law, commandeth acknowledgement naturall
 equalitie, therefore also law nature. observers
 law, call modest, breakers arrogant men.
 greeks call violation law pleonexia; is, desire
 share.
 



eleventh equity
 
also "if man trusted judge man man," precept
 law nature, "that deale equally them." without
 that, controversies men determined warre.
 therefore partiall judgment, doth lies, to
 deterre men use judges, arbitrators; consequently,
 (against fundamentall lawe nature) cause warre.
 
observance law, equall distribution man, of
 reason belongeth him, called equity, (as have
 sayd before) distributive justice: violation, acception persons,
 prosopolepsia.
 



twelfth, equall use things common
 
followeth another law, "that things be
 divided, enjoyed common, can be; quantity the
 thing permit, without stint; otherwise proportionably number of
 right." otherwise distribution unequall, and
 contrary equitie.
 



thirteenth, lot
 
things be, can neither divided, enjoyed in
 common. then, law nature, prescribeth equity, requireth,
 "that entire right; else, (making use alternate,) first
 possession, determined lot." equall distribution, of
 law nature; means equall distribution be
 imagined.
 



fourteenth, primogeniture, first seising
 
lots two sorts, arbitrary, naturall. arbitrary, is
 agreed competitors; naturall, either
 primogeniture, (which greek calls kleronomia, signifies, given
 lot;) first seisure.
 
therefore things enjoyed common, nor
 divided, adjudged first possessor; cases
 first-borne, acquired lot.
 



fifteenth, mediators
 
also law nature, "that men mediate peace, allowed
 safe conduct." law commandeth peace, end, commandeth
 intercession, means; intercession means safe
 conduct.
 



sixteenth, submission arbitrement
 
because, though men never willing observe lawes,
 may neverthelesse arise questions concerning mans action; first,
 whether done, done; secondly (if done) whether against
 law, law; former whereof, called a
 question fact; later question right; therefore unlesse the
 parties question, covenant mutually stand sentence
 another, farre peace ever. other, whose
 sentence submit, called arbitrator. therefore of
 law nature, "that controversie, submit their
 right judgement arbitrator."
 



seventeenth, man judge
 
seeing every man presumed things order own
 benefit, man fit arbitrator cause: were
 never fit; yet equity allowing party equall benefit, one
 admitted judge, admitted also; & the
 controversie, is, cause war, remains, law of
 nature.
 



eighteenth, man judge, cause partiality
 
reason man cause received for
 arbitrator, greater profit, honour, pleasure apparently
 ariseth victory one party, other: hath
 taken (though unavoydable bribe, yet) bribe; man can be
 obliged trust him. thus also controversie, condition
 war remaineth, contrary law nature.
 



nineteenth, witnesse
 
controversie fact, judge give credit
 one, other, (if arguments) must give
 credit third; third fourth; more: else the
 question undecided, left force, contrary law nature.
 
lawes nature, dictating peace, means the
 conservation men multitudes; onely concern doctrine
 civill society. things tending destruction of
 particular men; drunkenness, parts intemperance;
 may therefore also reckoned amongst things law
 nature hath forbidden; necessary mentioned, are
 pertinent enough place.
 



rule, laws nature may easily examined
 
though may seem subtile deduction lawes nature,
 taken notice men; whereof part busie in
 getting food, rest negligent understand; yet leave
 men unexcusable, contracted one easie sum,
 intelligible even meanest capacity; is, "do to
 another, thou wouldest done thy selfe;" sheweth
 him, learning lawes nature, but,
 weighing actions men own, seem too
 heavy, put part ballance, into
 place, passions, selfe-love, may adde nothing to
 weight; none lawes nature will
 appear unto reasonable.
 



lawes nature oblige conscience alwayes,
 
effect onely security lawes nature
 oblige foro interno; say, bind desire they
 take place: foro externo; is, putting them
 act, alwayes. modest, tractable, and
 performe promises, time, place, man els
 so, make himselfe prey others, procure his
 certain ruine, contrary ground lawes nature, which
 tend natures preservation. again, shall observe same
 lawes towards him, observes himselfe, seeketh peace, but
 war; & consequently destruction nature violence.
 
whatsoever lawes bind foro interno, may broken, onely by
 fact contrary law also fact according it, case a
 man think contrary. though action case, according
 law; obligation foro interno, breach.
 



laws nature eternal;
 
lawes nature immutable eternall, injustice,
 ingratitude, arrogance, pride, iniquity, acception persons, the
 rest, can never made lawfull. can never warre shall
 preserve life, peace destroy it.
 



yet easie
 
lawes, oblige onely desire, endeavour, i
 mean unfeigned constant endeavour, easie observed. for
 require nothing endeavour; endeavoureth their
 performance, fulfilleth them; fulfilleth law, just.
 



science lawes, true morall philosophy
 
science them, true onely moral philosophy. for
 morall philosophy nothing else science good, and
 evill, conversation, society mankind. good, evill,
 names signifie appetites, aversions; different
 tempers, customes, doctrines men, different: divers men,
 differ onely judgement, senses pleasant,
 unpleasant tast, smell, hearing, touch, sight; also
 conformable, disagreeable reason, actions of
 common life. nay, man, divers times, differs himselfe;
 one time praiseth, is, calleth good, another time
 dispraiseth, calleth evil: whence arise disputes,
 controversies, last war. therefore long man the
 condition meer nature, (which condition war,) private
 appetite measure good, evill: consequently men
 agree this, peace good, therefore also way, or
 means peace, (as shewed before) justice, gratitude,
 modesty, equity, mercy, & rest laws nature, good; that
 say, morall vertues; contrarie vices, evill. now the
 science vertue vice, morall philosophie; therfore true
 doctrine lawes nature, true morall philosophie. the
 writers morall philosophie, though acknowledge vertues
 vices; yet seeing wherein consisted goodnesse; that
 come praised, meanes peaceable, sociable, and
 comfortable living; place mediocrity passions: not
 cause, degree daring, made fortitude; cause,
 quantity gift, made liberality.
 
dictates reason, men use call name lawes; but
 improperly: conclusions, theoremes concerning what
 conduceth conservation defence themselves; whereas law,
 properly word him, right hath command others. but
 yet consider theoremes, delivered word of
 god, right commandeth things; properly called
 lawes.
 


chapter xvi. persons, authors, things personated
 


person what
 
person, "whose words actions considered, either his
 own, representing words actions man, any
 thing attributed, whether truly fiction."
 



person naturall, artificiall
 
considered owne, called naturall
 person: considered representing words and
 actions other, feigned artificiall person.
 



word person, whence
 
word person latine: instead whereof greeks prosopon,
 signifies face, persona latine signifies disguise,
 outward appearance man, counterfeited stage; somtimes
 particularly part it, disguiseth face, mask
 visard: stage, hath translated representer
 speech action, well tribunalls, theaters. a
 person, actor is, stage common
 conversation; personate, act, represent himselfe, an
 other; acteth another, said beare person, or
 act name; (in sence cicero useth saies, "unus
 sustineo tres personas; mei, adversarii, & judicis, beare three
 persons; own, adversaries, judges;") called in
 diverse occasions, diversly; representer, representative, a
 lieutenant, vicar, attorney, deputy, procurator, actor, and
 like.
 



actor, author; authority
 
persons artificiall, words actions owned by
 represent. person actor; that
 owneth words actions, author: case the
 actor acteth authority. speaking goods and
 possessions, called owner, latine dominus, greeke
 kurios; speaking actions, called author. right of
 possession, called dominion; right action, is
 called authority. authority, alwayes understood right
 act: done authority, done commission, licence
 whose right is.
 



covenants authority, bind author
 
hence followeth, actor maketh covenant by
 authority, bindeth thereby author, lesse made
 himselfe; lesse subjecteth consequences the
 same. therfore hath said formerly, (chap. 14) the
 nature covenants man man naturall capacity,
 true also made actors, representers, or
 procurators, authority them, far-forth their
 commission, farther.
 
therefore maketh covenant actor, representer,
 knowing authority hath, doth perill. man
 obliged covenant, whereof author; consequently by
 covenant made against, beside authority gave.
 



actor
 
actor doth thing law nature command of
 author, obliged former covenant obey him, he, but
 author breaketh law nature: though action against
 law nature; yet his: contrarily; refuse do
 it, law nature, forbiddeth breach covenant.
 



authority shewne
 
maketh covenant author, mediation the
 actor, knowing authority hath, onely takes word;
 case authority made manifest unto upon demand, is
 longer obliged: covenant made author, valid,
 without counter-assurance. covenanteth, knew
 hand expect assurance, actors word;
 covenant valid; actor case maketh
 himselfe author. therefore, authority evident,
 covenant obligeth author, actor; authority
 feigned, obligeth actor onely; author but
 himselfe.
 



things personated, inanimate
 
things, uncapable represented by
 fiction. inanimate things, church, hospital, bridge, may
 personated rector, master, overseer. things inanimate,
 authors, therefore give authority actors: yet the
 actors may authority procure maintenance, given by
 owners, governours things. therefore,
 things personated, state civill
 government.
 



irrational
 
likewise children, fooles, mad-men use reason, may
 personated guardians, curators; can authors (during
 time) action done them, longer (when shall
 recover use reason) shall judge reasonable.
 yet folly, hath right governing them, may give
 authority guardian. place state
 civill, estate, dominion persons.
 



false gods
 
idol, meer figment brain, may personated; the
 gods heathen; officers state appointed, were
 personated, held possessions, goods, rights, men
 time time dedicated, consecrated unto them. idols cannot
 authors: idol nothing. authority proceeded the
 state: therefore introduction civill government, gods
 heathen personated.
 



true god
 
true god may personated. was; first, moses; governed
 israelites, (that his, gods people,) own
 name, hoc dicit moses; gods name, hoc dicit dominus.
 secondly, man, blessed saviour jesus
 christ, came reduce jewes, induce nations the
 kingdome father; himselfe, sent father.
 thirdly, holy ghost, comforter, speaking, working
 apostles: holy ghost, comforter came of
 himselfe; sent, proceeded both.
 



multitude men, one person
 
multitude men, made one person, one man, or
 one person, represented; done consent of
 every one multitude particular. unity the
 representer, unity represented, maketh person
 one. representer beareth person, one
 person: unity, otherwise understood multitude.
 



every one author
 
multitude naturally one, many; cannot
 understood one; many authors, every thing their
 representative faith, doth name; every man giving their
 common representer, authority himselfe particular; owning
 actions representer doth, case give authority
 without stint: otherwise, limit what, farre
 shall represent them, none owneth more, gave him
 commission act.
 



actor may many men made one plurality voyces
 
representative consist many men, voyce greater
 number, must considered voyce all. lesser
 number pronounce (for example) affirmative, greater in
 negative, will negatives enough destroy
 affirmatives; thereby excesse negatives, standing
 uncontradicted, onely voyce representative hath.
 



representatives, number even, unprofitable
 
representative even number, especially number is
 great, whereby contradictory voyces oftentimes equall, is
 therefore oftentimes mute, uncapable action. yet cases
 contradictory voyces equall number, may determine question; in
 condemning, absolving, equality votes, even condemne
 not, absolve; contrary condemne, absolve
 not. cause heard; condemne, absolve; on
 contrary, say absolving, condemning, true. the
 like deliberation executing presently, deferring
 till another time; voyces equall, decreeing
 execution, decree dilation.
 



negative voyce
 
number odde, three, more, (men, assemblies;)
 whereof every one negative voice, authority take away the
 effect affirmative voices rest, number no
 representative; diversity opinions, interests of
 men, becomes oftentimes, cases greatest consequence, a
 mute person, unapt, may things else, government of
 multitude, especially time warre.
 
authors two sorts. first simply called; have
 defined him, owneth action another simply.
 second he, owneth action, covenant another
 conditionally; say, undertaketh it, the
 doth not, at, certain time. authors
 conditionall, generally called suretyes, latine fidejussores, and
 sponsores; particularly debt, praedes; appearance before
 judge, magistrate, vades.
 




part ii.
 common-wealth
 



chapter xvii. causes, generation, definition a
 common-wealth
 



end common-wealth, particular security
 
finall cause, end, designe men, (who naturally love liberty,
 dominion others,) introduction restraint upon
 themselves, (in wee see live common-wealths,) the
 foresight preservation, contented life
 thereby; say, getting miserable
 condition warre, necessarily consequent (as hath shewn)
 naturall passions men, visible power keep
 awe, tye feare punishment performance of
 covenants, observation lawes nature set in
 fourteenth fifteenth chapters.
 



law nature:
 
lawes nature (as justice, equity, modesty, mercy, (in
 summe) others, wee done to,) themselves, without
 terrour power, cause observed, contrary to
 naturall passions, carry us partiality, pride, revenge, and
 like. covenants, without sword, words, no
 strength secure man all. therefore notwithstanding lawes of
 nature, (which every one hath kept, will keep
 them, can safely,) power erected, not
 great enough security; every man will may lawfully rely on
 strength art, caution men. all
 places, men lived small families, robbe spoyle one
 another, trade, farre reputed the
 law nature, greater spoyles gained, greater was
 honour; men observed lawes therein, lawes of
 honour; is, abstain cruelty, leaving men lives,
 instruments husbandry. small familyes then; now
 cities kingdomes greater families (for own
 security) enlarge dominions, upon pretences danger, and
 fear invasion, assistance may given invaders, endeavour
 much can, subdue, weaken neighbours, open
 force, secret arts, want caution, justly; are
 remembred ages honour.
 



conjunction men familyes
 
joyning together small number men, gives them
 security; small numbers, small additions one side
 other, make advantage strength great, sufficient
 carry victory; therefore gives encouragement invasion.
 multitude sufficient confide security, not
 determined certain number, comparison enemy we
 feare; sufficient, odds enemy so
 visible conspicuous moment, determine event warre, to
 move attempt.
 



great multitude, unlesse directed one judgement
 
never great multitude; yet actions be
 directed according particular judgements, particular
 appetites, can expect thereby defence, protection, neither
 common enemy, injuries one another. for
 distracted opinions concerning best use application
 strength, help, hinder one another; reduce
 strength mutuall opposition nothing: whereby are
 easily, onely subdued agree together; also
 common enemy, make warre upon other, for
 particular interests. suppose great multitude of
 men consent observation justice, lawes nature,
 without common power keep awe; might well suppose
 man-kind same; neither need to
 civill government, common-wealth all; would
 peace without subjection.
 



continually
 
enough security, men desire last all
 time life, governed, directed one
 judgement, limited time; one battell, one warre. for
 though obtain victory unanimous endeavour a
 forraign enemy; yet afterwards, either common enemy,
 one part held enemy, another part held for
 friend, must needs difference interests dissolve,
 fall warre amongst themselves.
 



certain creatures without reason, speech,
 



neverthelesse live society, without coercive power
 
true, certain living creatures, bees, ants, live
 sociably one another, (which therefore aristotle numbred
 amongst politicall creatures;) yet direction, than
 particular judgements appetites; speech, whereby one of
 can signifie another, thinks expedient common
 benefit: therefore man may perhaps desire know, man-kind
 same. answer,
 
first, men continually competition honour dignity,
 creatures not; consequently amongst men there
 ariseth ground, envy hatred, finally warre; amongst
 so.
 
secondly, amongst creatures, common good differeth not
 private; nature enclined private, they
 procure thereby common benefit. man, whose joy consisteth
 comparing himselfe men, can relish nothing is
 eminent.
 
thirdly, creatures, (as man) use reason,
 see, think see fault, administration their
 common businesse: whereas amongst men, many, thinke
 wiser, abler govern publique, better the
 rest; strive reforme innovate, one way, another
 way; thereby bring distraction civill warre.
 
fourthly, creatures, though use voice, in
 making knowne one another desires, affections; yet
 want art words, men can represent others,
 good, likenesse evill; evill, the
 likenesse good; augment, diminish apparent greatnesse of
 good evill; discontenting men, troubling peace their
 pleasure.
 
fiftly, irrationall creatures distinguish betweene injury, and
 dammage; therefore long ease, offended
 fellowes: whereas man troublesome, is
 ease: loves shew wisdome, and
 controule actions governe common-wealth.
 
lastly, agreement creatures naturall; men, is
 covenant only, artificiall: therefore wonder
 somewhat else required (besides covenant) make their
 agreement constant lasting; common power, keep in
 awe, direct actions common benefit.
 



generation common-wealth
 
way erect common power, may able defend them
 invasion forraigners, injuries one another, and
 thereby secure sort, owne industrie,
 fruites earth, may nourish live
 contentedly; is, conferre power strength upon one
 man, upon one assembly men, may reduce wills,
 plurality voices, unto one will: much say, to
 appoint one man, assembly men, beare person; every
 one owne, acknowledge himselfe author whatsoever he
 beareth person, shall act, cause acted, those
 things concerne common peace safetie; therein to
 submit wills, every one will, judgements, his
 judgment. consent, concord; reall unitie of
 all, one person, made covenant every man with
 every man, manner, every man say every man, "i
 authorise give right governing selfe, man, to
 assembly men, condition, thou give thy right
 him, authorise actions like manner." done, the
 multitude united one person, called common-wealth, latine
 civitas. generation great leviathan, rather (to
 speake reverently) mortall god, wee owe the
 immortall god, peace defence. authoritie, given him
 every particular man common-wealth, hath use so
 much power strength conferred him, terror thereof, is
 inabled forme wills all, peace home, mutuall
 ayd enemies abroad.
 



definition common-wealth
 
consisteth essence common-wealth; (to
 define it,) "one person, whose acts great multitude, mutuall
 covenants one another, made every one author,
 end may use strength means all, shall
 think expedient, peace common defence."
 



soveraigne, subject, what
 
carryeth person, called soveraigne, said have
 soveraigne power; every one besides, subject.
 
attaining soveraigne power, two wayes. one, by
 naturall force; man maketh children, submit themselves,
 children government, able destroy if
 refuse, warre subdueth enemies will, giving them
 lives condition. other, men agree amongst
 themselves, submit man, assembly men, voluntarily, on
 confidence protected others. later, may be
 called politicall common-wealth, common-wealth institution; and
 former, common-wealth acquisition. first, shall speak of
 common-wealth institution.
 


chapter xviii. rights soveraignes institution
 



act instituting common-wealth, what
 
common-wealth said instituted, multitude men do
 agree, covenant, every one every one, whatsoever man,
 assembly men, shall given major part, right
 present person all, (that say, their
 representative;) every one, well voted it, that
 voted it, shall authorise actions judgements, of
 man, assembly men, manner, his
 own, end, live peaceably amongst themselves, protected
 men.
 



consequences institution, are
 



1. subjects change forme government
 



institution common-wealth derived rights, and
 facultyes him, them, soveraigne power conferred by
 consent people assembled.
 
first, covenant, understood, not
 obliged former covenant thing repugnant hereunto. and
 consequently already instituted common-wealth, being
 thereby bound covenant, actions, judgements one,
 lawfully make new covenant, amongst themselves, obedient
 other, thing whatsoever, without permission. and
 therefore, subjects monarch, without leave
 cast monarchy, return confusion disunited multitude;
 transferre person beareth it, another man,
 assembly men: bound, every man every man,
 own, reputed author all, already their
 soveraigne, shall do, judge fit done: one man
 dissenting, rest break covenant made man,
 injustice: also every man given soveraignty
 beareth person; therefore depose him,
 take own, injustice.
 besides, attempteth depose soveraign, killed, or
 punished attempt, author punishment,
 institution, author soveraign shall do: and
 injustice man thing, may be
 punished authority, also upon title, unjust.
 whereas men pretended disobedience their
 soveraign, new covenant, made, men, god; also
 unjust: covenant god, mediation some
 body representeth gods person; none doth gods lieutenant,
 hath soveraignty god. pretence covenant with
 god, evident lye, even pretenders consciences, that
 onely act unjust, also vile, unmanly
 disposition.
 



2. soveraigne power forfeited
 
secondly, right bearing person all, given
 make soveraigne, covenant onely one another, and
 them; can happen breach covenant the
 part soveraigne; consequently none subjects, any
 pretence forfeiture, can freed subjection. which
 made soveraigne maketh covenant subjects beforehand, is
 manifest; either must make whole multitude, as
 one party covenant; must make severall covenant with
 every man. whole, one party, impossible; as
 yet one person: make many severall covenants
 men, covenants hath soveraignty voyd,
 act soever can pretended one breach
 thereof, act himselfe, rest, done
 person, right every one particular.
 besides, one, them, pretend breach covenant
 made soveraigne institution; others, one of
 subjects, himselfe alone, pretend breach,
 case, judge decide controversie: returns
 therefore sword again; every man recovereth right of
 protecting himselfe strength, contrary designe they
 institution. therefore vain grant soveraignty by
 way precedent covenant. opinion monarch receiveth his
 power covenant, say condition, proceedeth want
 understanding easie truth, covenants words, and
 breath, force oblige, contain, constrain, protect man,
 publique sword; is, untyed hands
 man, assembly men hath soveraignty, whose
 actions avouched all, performed strength them
 all, united. assembly men made soveraigne; then
 man imagineth covenant past institution; for
 man dull say, example, people rome, made
 covenant romans, hold soveraignty such
 conditions; performed, romans might lawfully depose the
 roman people. men see reason alike monarchy, and
 popular government, proceedeth ambition some, that
 kinder government assembly, whereof may hope to
 participate, monarchy, despair enjoy.
 



3. man can without injustice protest institution the
 soveraigne declared major part.
 
thirdly, major part hath consenting voices declared a
 soveraigne; dissented must now consent rest; is,
 contented avow actions shall do, else justly be
 destroyed rest. voluntarily entered the
 congregation assembled, sufficiently declared
 thereby will (and therefore tacitely covenanted) stand what
 major part ordayne: therefore refuse stand
 thereto, make protestation decrees, does
 contrary covenant, therfore unjustly. whether of
 congregation, not; whether consent asked, not, he
 must either submit decrees, left condition of
 warre before; wherein might without injustice destroyed
 man whatsoever.
 



4. soveraigns actions justly accused subject
 
fourthly, every subject institution author the
 actions, judgements soveraigne instituted; followes, that
 whatsoever doth, can injury subjects; nor
 accused injustice. doth any
 thing authority another, doth therein injury whose
 authority acteth: institution common-wealth, every
 particular man author soveraigne doth; consequently
 complaineth injury soveraigne, complaineth that
 whereof himselfe author; therefore accuse man
 himselfe; himselfe injury; injury ones
 selfe, impossible. true soveraigne
 power, may commit iniquity; injustice, injury proper
 signification.
 



5. soever soveraigne doth, unpunishable subject
 
fiftly, consequently sayd last, man hath
 soveraigne power can justly put death, otherwise manner
 subjects punished. seeing every subject author the
 actions soveraigne; punisheth another, actions
 committed himselfe.
 



6. soveraigne judge necessary peace and
 defence subjects
 
end institution, peace defence of
 all; whosoever right end, right means;
 belongeth right, whatsoever man, assembly hath the
 soveraignty, judge meanes peace defence;
 also hindrances, disturbances same; do
 whatsoever shall think necessary done, beforehand, the
 preserving peace security, prevention discord home and
 hostility abroad; and, peace security lost, the
 recovery same. therefore,
 



judge doctrines fit taught them
 
sixtly, annexed soveraignty, judge opinions
 doctrines averse, conducing peace; consequently,
 occasions, farre, what, men trusted withall,
 speaking multitudes people; shall examine doctrines
 bookes published. actions men proceed
 opinions; wel governing opinions, consisteth
 well governing mens actions, order peace, and
 concord. though matter doctrine, nothing regarded
 truth; yet repugnant regulating by
 peace. doctrine repugnant peace, can true, peace
 concord can law nature. true, in
 common-wealth, negligence, unskilfullnesse of
 governours, teachers, false doctrines time generally
 received; contrary truths may generally offensive; yet most
 sudden, rough busling new truth, can be, never
 breake peace, onely somtimes awake warre. men that
 remissely governed, dare take armes, defend, or
 introduce opinion, still warre; condition peace,
 cessation armes feare one another; live
 were, procincts battaile continually. belongeth
 therefore hath soveraign power, judge, or
 constitute judges opinions doctrines, thing necessary to
 peace, thereby prevent discord civill warre.
 



7. right making rules, whereby subject may every man know
 owne, subject can without injustice take it
 him
 
seventhly, annexed soveraigntie, whole power of
 prescribing rules, whereby every man may know, goods may
 enjoy actions may doe, without molested of
 fellow subjects: men call propriety. before
 constitution soveraign power (as hath already shewn) men had
 right things; necessarily causeth warre: therefore this
 proprietie, necessary peace, depending soveraign power,
 act power, order publique peace. rules of
 propriety (or meum tuum) good, evill, lawfull unlawfull
 actions subjects, civill lawes, say, the
 lawes commonwealth particular; though name civill law
 now restrained antient civill lawes city rome; which
 head great part world, lawes time were
 parts civill law.
 



8. also belongeth right judicature decision of
 controversies:
 
eightly, annexed soveraigntie, right judicature; that
 say, hearing deciding controversies, may arise
 concerning law, either civill, naturall, concerning fact. for
 without decision controversies, protection one
 subject, injuries another; lawes concerning meum and
 tuum vaine; every man remaineth, naturall and
 necessary appetite conservation, right protecting
 himselfe private strength, condition warre; and
 contrary end every common-wealth instituted.
 



9. making war, peace, shall think best:
 
ninthly, annexed soveraignty, right making warre, and
 peace nations, common-wealths; say, of
 judging publique good, great forces to
 assembled, armed, payd end; levy mony upon the
 subjects, defray expenses thereof. power the
 people defended, consisteth armies; strength
 army, union strength one command; which
 command soveraign instituted, therefore hath; command
 militia, without institution, maketh hath it
 soveraign. therefore whosoever made generall army, that
 hath soveraign power alwayes generallissimo.
 



10. choosing counsellours, ministers, peace, and
 warre:
 
tenthly, annexed soveraignty, choosing all
 councellours, ministers, magistrates, officers, peace, and
 war. seeing soveraign charged end, the
 common peace defence; understood power use such
 means, shall think fit discharge.
 



11. rewarding, punishing, (where no
 former law hath determined measure it) arbitrary:
 
eleventhly, soveraign committed power rewarding
 riches, honour; punishing corporall, pecuniary
 punishment, ignominy every subject according lawe hath
 formerly made; law made, according shall judge
 conduce encouraging men serve common-wealth, or
 deterring dis-service same.
 



12. honour order
 
lastly, considering values men naturally apt set upon
 themselves; respect look others; little they
 value men; whence continually arise amongst them, emulation,
 quarrells, factions, last warre, destroying one
 another, diminution strength common enemy; it
 necessary lawes honour, publique rate the
 worth men deserved, able deserve well the
 common-wealth; force hands other, to
 put lawes execution. hath already shown, not
 onely whole militia, forces common-wealth; also the
 judicature controversies, annexed soveraignty. the
 soveraign therefore belongeth also give titles honour; to
 appoint order place, dignity, man shall hold; what
 signes respect, publique private meetings, shall give to
 one another.
 



rights indivisible
 
rights, make essence soveraignty; which
 markes, whereby man may discern man, assembly
 men, soveraign power placed, resideth. are
 incommunicable, inseparable. power coyn mony; dispose of
 estate persons infant heires; praeemption in
 markets; statute praerogatives, may transferred the
 soveraign; yet power protect subject retained. if
 transferre militia, retains judicature vain, want
 execution lawes; grant away power raising
 mony; militia vain: give away government of
 doctrines, men will frighted rebellion feare of
 spirits. consider one said rights, shall
 presently see, holding rest, will produce no
 effect, conservation peace justice, end all
 common-wealths instituted. division it, whereof is
 said, "a kingdome divided selfe stand:" unlesse this
 division precede, division opposite armies can never happen. if
 first opinion received greatest part of
 england, powers divided king, lords,
 house commons, people never divided, and
 fallen civill warre; first disagreed
 politiques; dissenters liberty of
 religion; instructed men point soveraign right,
 now (in england,) see, rights
 inseparable, will generally acknowledged, next
 return peace; continue, till miseries forgotten; and
 longer, except vulgar better taught hetherto
 been.
 



can grant passe away without direct renouncing the
 soveraign power
 
essentiall inseparable rights, follows
 necessarily, whatsoever, words seem granted
 away, yet soveraign power selfe direct termes
 renounced, name soveraign given grantees to
 grants them, grant voyd: granted he
 can, grant back soveraignty, restored, inseparably
 annexed thereunto.
 



power honour subjects vanisheth presence power
 soveraign
 
great authority indivisible, inseparably annexed the
 soveraignty, little ground opinion them, say of
 soveraign kings, though singulis majores, greater power than
 every one subjects, yet universis minores, lesse
 power together. together, mean not
 collective body one person, together, every one,
 signifie same; speech absurd. together,
 understand one person (which person soveraign bears,)
 power together, soveraigns power;
 speech absurd; absurdity see well enough,
 soveraignty assembly people; monarch
 see not; yet power soveraignty in
 whomsoever placed.
 
power, also honour soveraign, be
 greater, any, subjects. soveraignty
 fountain honour. dignities lord, earle, duke, and
 prince creatures. presence master, servants
 equall, without honour all; subjects, the
 presence soveraign. though shine more, lesse,
 sight; yet presence, shine more
 starres presence sun.
 



soveraigne power hurtfull want it, hurt proceeds
 greatest part submitting readily, lesse
 
man may object, condition subjects very
 miserable; obnoxious lusts, irregular passions
 him, unlimited power hands. and
 commonly live monarch, think fault monarchy;
 live government democracy, other
 soveraign assembly, attribute inconvenience forme of
 common-wealth; whereas power formes, perfect
 enough protect them, same; considering estate
 man can never without incommodity other; the
 greatest, forme government can possibly happen the
 people generall, scarce sensible, respect miseries, and
 horrible calamities, accompany civill warre; dissolute
 condition masterlesse men, without subjection lawes, a
 coercive power tye hands rapine, revenge: nor
 considering greatest pressure soveraign governours,
 proceedeth delight, profit can expect the
 dammage, weakening subjects, whose vigor, consisteth
 selves, unwillingly contributing defence,
 make necessary governours draw can
 time peace, may means emergent occasion, or
 sudden need, resist, take advantage enemies. men
 nature provided notable multiplying glasses, (that their
 passions self-love,) which, every little payment appeareth a
 great grievance; destitute prospective glasses, (namely
 morall civill science,) see farre miseries hang
 them, without payments avoyded.
 



chapter xix. severall kinds common-wealth institution,
 succession soveraigne power
 



different formes common-wealths three
 
difference common-wealths, consisteth difference the
 soveraign, person representative every one the
 multitude. soveraignty either one man, an
 assembly one; assembly either every man hath
 right enter, every one, certain men distinguished the
 rest; manifest, can three kinds common-wealth. for
 representative must needs one man, more: more, it
 assembly all, part. representative one
 man, common-wealth monarchy: assembly that
 will come together, democracy, popular common-wealth:
 assembly part onely, called aristocracy.
 kind common-wealth can none: either one, or
 more, must soveraign power (which shewn be
 indivisible) entire.
 



tyranny oligarchy, different names monarchy, aristocracy
 
names government, histories, books of
 policy; tyranny, oligarchy: names other
 formes government, formes misliked. that
 discontented monarchy, call tyranny; are
 displeased aristocracy, called oligarchy: also, which
 find grieved democracy, call anarchy, (which
 signifies want government;) yet think man believes, that
 want government, new kind government: same
 reason believe, government one kind, when
 like it, another, mislike it, oppressed the
 governours.
 



subordinate representatives dangerous
 
manifest, men absolute liberty, may, they
 please, give authority one man, represent every one; as
 well give authority assembly men whatsoever; and
 consequently may subject themselves, think good, monarch,
 absolutely, representative. therefore, is
 already erected soveraign power, can representative
 people, onely certain particular ends, the
 soveraign limited. erect two soveraigns; every
 man person represented two actors, opposing one
 another, must needs divide power, (if men will live peace)
 indivisible, thereby reduce multitude condition of
 warre, contrary end soveraignty instituted. and
 therefore absurd, think soveraign assembly, inviting
 people dominion, send deputies, power
 make known advise, desires, therefore hold such
 deputies, rather themselves, absolute representative of
 people: absurd also, think monarchy. and
 know manifest truth, late little
 observed; monarchy, soveraignty descent
 600 years, alone called soveraign, title majesty from
 every one subjects, unquestionably taken them
 king; notwithstanding never considered their
 representative; name without contradiction passing title
 men, command sent people carry
 petitions, give (if permitted it) advise. which
 may serve admonition, true, absolute
 representative people, instruct men nature that
 office, take heed admit generall
 representation upon occasion whatsoever, mean discharge
 truth committed them.
 



comparison monarchy, soveraign assemblyes
 
difference three kindes common-wealth, consisteth
 difference power; difference convenience, or
 aptitude produce peace, security people; end
 instituted. compare monarchy two, may
 observe; first, whosoever beareth person people, or
 one assembly bears it, beareth also naturall
 person. though carefull politique person procure
 common interest; yet more, lesse carefull procure the
 private good himselfe, family, kindred friends; the
 part, publique interest chance crosse private, he
 preferrs private: passions men, commonly potent
 reason. whence follows, publique and
 private interest closely united, publique most
 advanced. now monarchy, private interest the
 publique. riches, power, honour monarch arise onely from
 riches, strength reputation subjects. king can
 rich, glorious, secure; whose subjects either poore, or
 contemptible, weak want, dissention, maintain a
 war enemies: whereas democracy, aristocracy, the
 publique prosperity conferres much private fortune one
 corrupt, ambitious, doth many times perfidious advice, a
 treacherous action, civill warre.
 
secondly, monarch receiveth counsell whom, when, he
 pleaseth; consequently may heare opinion men versed the
 matter deliberates, rank quality soever, and
 long time action, much secrecy, will.
 soveraigne assembly need counsell, none admitted
 right thereto beginning; the
 part beene versed acquisition
 wealth knowledge; give advice long
 discourses, may, commonly excite men action, but
 governe it. understanding flame the
 passions, never enlightned, dazled: place, time,
 wherein assemblie can receive counsell secrecie, of
 owne multitude.
 
thirdly, resolutions monarch, subject other
 inconstancy, humane nature; assemblies, besides that
 nature, ariseth inconstancy number. absence
 few, resolution taken, continue firme,
 (which may happen security, negligence, private impediments,) or
 diligent appearance contrary opinion, undoes day,
 concluded yesterday.
 
fourthly, monarch disagree himselfe, envy, or
 interest; assembly may; height, may produce
 civill warre.
 
fifthly, monarchy inconvenience; subject,
 power one man, enriching favourite flatterer,
 may deprived possesseth; confesse great and
 inevitable inconvenience. may well happen, the
 soveraigne power assembly: power same; and
 subject evill counsell, seduced orators, as
 monarch flatterers; becoming one others flatterers, serve
 one anothers covetousnesse ambition turnes. whereas the
 favorites assembly, many; kindred much numerous,
 monarch. besides, favourite monarch, which
 well succour friends, hurt enemies: orators,
 say, favourites soveraigne assemblies, though have
 great power hurt, little save. accuse, requires lesse
 eloquence (such mans nature) excuse; condemnation, than
 absolution resembles justice.
 
sixtly, inconvenience monarchie, soveraigntie
 may descend upon infant, one discerne good and
 evill: consisteth this, use power, must the
 hand another man, assembly men, governe by
 right, name; curators, protectors person,
 authority. say inconvenience, putting use of
 soveraign power, hand man, assembly men; is
 say government inconvenient, confusion, and
 civill warre. therefore danger can pretended, must
 arise contention those, office great
 honour, profit, may become competitors. make appear, that
 inconvenience, proceedeth forme government call
 monarchy, consider, precedent monarch, hath appointed
 shall tuition infant successor, either expressely
 testament, tacitly, controlling custome that
 case received: inconvenience (if happen) be
 attributed, monarchy, ambition, injustice of
 subjects; kinds government, people are
 well instructed duty, rights soveraignty, is
 same. else precedent monarch, hath taken order for
 tuition; law nature hath provided sufficient
 rule, tuition shall him, hath nature most
 interest preservation authority infant, whom
 least benefit can accrue death, diminution. seeing every
 man nature seeketh benefit, promotion; put infant
 power those, can promote destruction,
 dammage, tuition, trechery. sufficient provision
 taken, just quarrell, government a
 child, contention arise disturbance publique peace,
 attributed forme monarchy, ambition
 subjects, ignorance duty. side, is
 great common-wealth, soveraignty whereof great assembly,
 not, consultations peace, warre, making of
 lawes, condition, government child. for
 child wants judgement dissent counsell given him, and
 thereby necessitated take advise them, him, he
 committed: assembly wanteth liberty, dissent the
 counsell major part, good, bad. child need
 tutor, protector, preserve person, authority: also
 (in great common-wealths,) soveraign assembly, great dangers
 troubles, need custodes libertatis; dictators, or
 protectors authoritie; much temporary monarchs;
 time, may commit entire exercise power;
 (at end time) oftner deprived thereof, than
 infant kings, protectors, regents, tutors.
 
though kinds soveraigntie be, now shewn, three;
 say, monarchie, one man it; democracie, where
 generall assembly subjects hath it; aristocracie, is
 assembly certain persons nominated, otherwise distinguished
 rest: yet shall consider particular common-wealthes
 been, world, will perhaps easily reduce
 three, may thereby inclined think other
 formes, arising mingled together. example, elective
 kingdomes; kings soveraigne power put hands
 time; kingdomes, wherein king hath power limited: which
 governments, nevertheless writers called monarchie. likewise
 popular, aristocraticall common-wealth, subdue enemies
 countrie, govern same, president, procurator, or
 magistrate; may seeme perhaps first sight, a
 democraticall, aristocraticall government. so. for
 elective kings, soveraignes, ministers soveraigne;
 limited kings soveraignes, ministers the
 soveraigne power: provinces subjection a
 democracie, aristocracie another common-wealth, democratically, or
 aristocratically governed, monarchically.
 
first, concerning elective king, whose power limited to
 life, many places christendome day; to
 certaine yeares moneths, dictators power amongst romans;
 right appoint successor, elective but
 hereditary. power elect successor, there
 man, assembly known, decease may elect
 new, else common-wealth dieth, dissolveth him, and
 returneth condition warre. known power
 give soveraigntie death, known also the
 soveraigntie before: none right give which
 right possesse, keep themselves, think
 good. none can give soveraigntie, the
 decease first elected; power, nay is
 obliged law nature, provide, establishing successor,
 keep trusted government, relapsing
 miserable condition civill warre. consequently was,
 elected, soveraign absolute.
 
secondly, king whose power limited, superiour him, or
 power limit it; superiour, is
 supreme; say soveraign. soveraignty therefore
 alwaies assembly right limit him; and
 consequence government monarchy, either democracy, or
 aristocracy; old time sparta; kings priviledge
 lead armies; soveraignty ephori.
 
thirdly, whereas heretofore roman people, governed land judea
 (for example) president; yet judea therefore democracy;
 governed assembly, which, of
 them, right enter; aristocracy; were
 governed assembly, which, man enter their
 election: governed one person, though the
 people rome assembly people, democracy; yet to
 people judea, right participating the
 government, monarch. though people governed
 assembly, chosen number, the
 government called democracy, aristocracy; yet are
 governed assembly, choosing, ’tis monarchy; not
 one man, another man; one people, another people.
 



right succession
 
formes government, matter mortall, not
 onely monarchs, also whole assemblies dy, necessary the
 conservation peace men, order taken for
 artificiall man, order also taken, artificiall
 eternity life; without which, men governed assembly,
 return condition warre every age; they
 governed one man, soon governour dyeth. this
 artificiall eternity, men call right succession.
 
perfect forme government, disposing the
 succession present soveraign. other
 particular man, private assembly, person subject, may
 assumed soveraign pleasure; consequently right
 himselfe. particular man, left new
 choyce; common-wealth dissolved; right him
 can get it; contrary intention institute
 common-wealth, perpetuall, temporary security.
 
democracy, whole assembly faile, unlesse multitude
 governed faile. therefore questions right of
 succession, forme government place all.
 
aristocracy, assembly dyeth, election of
 another room belongeth assembly, soveraign, to
 belongeth choosing counsellours, officers. that
 representative doth, actor, every one subjects doth,
 author. though soveraign assembly, may give power others,
 elect new men, supply court; yet still their
 authority, election made; may (when the
 publique shall require it) recalled.
 
present monarch hath right dispose succession greatest
 difficultie right succession, monarchy: the
 difficulty ariseth this, first sight, manifest
 appoint successor; many times, he
 hath appointed. cases, required exact
 ratiocination, every man accustomed use. question,
 shall appoint successor, monarch hath soveraign
 authority; say, (for elective kings princes the
 soveraign power propriety, use only,) consider, that
 either possession, right dispose succession,
 else right dissolved multitude. death
 hath soveraign power propriety, leaves multitude
 without soveraign all; is, without representative in
 united, capable one action at
 all: therefore incapable election new monarch;
 every man equall right submit himselfe thinks
 best able protect him, can, protect himselfe owne
 sword; returne confusion, condition war of
 every man every man, contrary end monarchy had
 first institution. therfore manifest, institution
 monarchy, disposing successor, alwaies left the
 judgment will present possessor.
 
question (which may arise sometimes) the
 monarch possession, hath designed succession inheritance
 power; determined expresse words, testament; or
 tacite signes sufficient.
 



succession passeth expresse words;
 
expresse words, testament, declared life
 time, viva voce, writing; first emperours rome declared
 heires. word heire selfe
 imply children, nearest kindred man; whomsoever man
 shall way declare, succeed estate.
 therefore monarch declare expresly, man shall his
 heire, either word writing, man immediately the
 decease predecessor, invested right monarch.
 



or, controlling custome;
 
testament, expresse words wanting, naturall
 signes will followed: whereof one custome. and
 therefore custome is, next kindred absolutely
 succeedeth, also next kindred hath right succession;
 that, will posession otherwise,
 might easily declared life time. likewise
 custome is, next male kindred succeedeth,
 also right succession next kindred male,
 reason. custome advance the
 female. whatsoever custome man may word controule, does
 not, naturall signe custome stand.
 



or, presumption naturall affection
 
neither custome, testament hath preceded, is
 understood, first, monarchs will is, government
 remain monarchicall; hath approved government in
 himselfe. secondly, child own, male, female, be
 preferred other; men presumed enclined
 nature, advance children, children other
 men; own, rather male female; men, are
 naturally fitter women, actions labour danger. thirdly,
 issue faileth, rather brother stranger; so
 still neerer bloud, rather remote, is
 alwayes presumed neerer kin, neerer affection; and
 ’tis evident man receives alwayes, reflexion, honour
 greatnesse neerest kindred.
 



dispose succession, though king another nation, not
 unlawfull
 
lawfull monarch dispose succession words
 contract, testament, men may perhaps object great inconvenience:
 may sell, give right governing stranger; which,
 strangers (that is, men used live same
 government, speaking language) commonly undervalue one
 another, may turn oppression subjects; indeed
 great inconvenience; proceedeth necessarily the
 subjection strangers government, unskilfulnesse the
 governours, ignorant true rules politiques. therefore
 romans subdued many nations, make government
 digestible, wont take away grievance, much they
 thought necessary, giving sometimes whole nations, sometimes
 principall men every nation conquered, onely the
 privileges, also name romans; took many the
 senate, offices charge, even roman city. it
 wise king, king james, aymed at, endeavouring union of
 two realms england scotland. obtained,
 likelihood prevented civill warres, make those
 kingdomes present, miserable. therefore injury to
 people, monarch dispose succession will; though
 fault many princes, hath sometimes found inconvenient.
 lawfulnesse it, also argument, whatsoever
 inconvenience can arrive giving kingdome stranger, may arrive
 also marrying strangers, right succession may
 descend upon them: yet men accounted lawfull.
 


chapter xx. dominion paternall despoticall
 

common-wealth acquisition, that, soveraign power is
 acquired force; acquired force, men singly, or
 many together plurality voyces, fear death, bonds, do
 authorise actions man, assembly, hath their
 lives liberty power.
 



wherein different common-wealth institution
 
kind dominion, soveraignty, differeth soveraignty by
 institution, onely this, men choose soveraign, it
 fear one another, institute: this
 case, subject themselves, afraid of. cases
 fear: noted them, hold such
 covenants, proceed fear death, violence, voyd: if
 true, man, kind common-wealth, obliged
 obedience. true, common-wealth instituted, or
 acquired, promises proceeding fear death, violence, no
 covenants, obliging, thing promised contrary the
 lawes; reason not, made upon fear, because
 promiseth, hath right thing promised. also, he
 may lawfully performe, doth not, invalidity of
 covenant, absolveth him, sentence soveraign.
 otherwise, whensoever man lawfully promiseth, unlawfully breaketh:
 soveraign, actor, acquitteth him, is
 acquitted exorted promise, author such
 absolution.
 



rights soveraignty both
 
rights, consequences soveraignty, both.
 power cannot, without consent, transferred another: he
 forfeit it: accused subjects, of
 injury: punished them: judge necessary
 peace; judge doctrines: sole legislator; supreme
 judge controversies; times, occasions warre,
 peace: belongeth choose magistrates, counsellours,
 commanders, officers, ministers; determine of
 rewards, punishments, honour, order. reasons whereof, are
 alledged precedent chapter, same
 rights, consequences soveraignty institution.
 



dominion paternall attained generation, contract
 
dominion acquired two wayes; generation, conquest. the
 right dominion generation, that, parent hath over
 children; called paternall. derived the
 generation, therefore parent dominion child
 begat him; childs consent, either expresse, or
 sufficient arguments declared. generation, god
 hath ordained man helper; alwayes two equally
 parents: dominion therefore child, belong equally to
 both; equally subject both, impossible; man
 can obey two masters. whereas attributed dominion to
 man onely, excellent sex; misreckon it.
 always difference strength prudence between

 obedience, him, whose power save, destroy him.
 



precedent subjection one parents other
 
mother fathers subject, child, fathers
 power: father mothers subject, (as soveraign
 queen marrieth one subjects,) child subject mother;
 father also subject.
 
man woman, monarches two severall kingdomes, child,
 contract concerning shall dominion him, right of
 dominion passeth contract. contract not, dominion
 followeth dominion place residence. soveraign
 country hath dominion reside therein.
 
hath dominion child, hath dominion also their
 childrens children. hath dominion person man,
 hath dominion his; without which, dominion a
 title, without effect.
 



right succession followeth rules rights possession
 
right succession paternall dominion, proceedeth same
 manner, doth right succession monarchy; have
 already sufficiently spoken precedent chapter.
 



despoticall dominion, attained
 
dominion acquired conquest, victory war, some
 writers call despoticall, despotes, signifieth lord, or
 master; dominion master servant. this
 dominion acquired victor, vanquished, avoyd
 present stroke death, covenanteth either expresse words, by
 sufficient signes will, long life, and
 liberty body allowed him, victor shall use
 thereof, pleasure. covenant made, vanquished
 servant, before: word servant (whether be
 derived servire, serve, servare, save, leave
 grammarians dispute) meant captive, kept in
 prison, bonds, till owner took him, bought him
 one did, shall consider him: (for men,
 (commonly called slaves,) obligation all; may break their
 bonds, prison; kill, carry away captive master,
 justly:) one, taken, hath corporall liberty allowed him;
 upon promise run away, violence master, is
 trusted him.
 



victory, consent vanquished
 
therefore victory, giveth right dominion over
 vanquished, covenant. obliged is
 conquered; say, beaten, taken, put flight; but
 commeth in, submitteth victor; victor
 obliged enemies rendring himselfe, (without promise life,) to
 spare yeelding discretion; obliges the
 victor longer, discretion hee shall think fit.
 
men do, demand (as now called) quarter, (which
 greeks called zogria, taking alive,) evade present fury of
 victor, submission, compound life, ransome,
 service: therefore hath quarter, hath life given,
 deferred till farther deliberation; yeelding on
 condition life, discretion. onely life in
 security, service due, victor hath trusted his
 corporall liberty. slaves work prisons, fetters, it
 duty, avoyd cruelty task-masters.
 
master servant, master also hath; may exact
 use thereof; say, goods, labour, his
 servants, children, often shall think fit. he
 holdeth life master, covenant obedience; is,
 owning, authorising whatsoever master shall do. case
 master, refuse, kill him, cast bonds, otherwise
 punish disobedience, himselfe author same;
 accuse injury.
 
summe rights consequences paternall despoticall
 dominion, soveraign institution;
 reasons: reasons set precedent
 chapter. man monarch divers nations, whereof he
 hath, one soveraignty institution people assembled, and
 another conquest, submission particular,
 avoyd death bonds; demand one nation other,
 title conquest, conquered nation, act of
 ignorance rights soveraignty. soveraign absolute
 alike; else soveraignty all; every
 man may lawfully protect himselfe, can, sword, which
 condition war.
 



difference family kingdom
 
appears, great family part some
 common-wealth, self, rights soveraignty, little
 monarchy; whether family consist man children; of
 man servants; man, children, servants
 together: wherein father master soveraign. yet a
 family properly common-wealth; unlesse power by
 number, opportunities, subdued without
 hazard war. number men manifestly weak to
 defend united, every one may use reason time of
 danger, save life, either flight, submission to
 enemy, hee shall think best; manner small
 company souldiers, surprised army, may cast armes,
 demand quarter, run away, rather put sword. and
 thus much shall suffice; concerning find speculation, and
 deduction, soveraign rights, nature, need, designes
 men, erecting commonwealths, putting under
 monarchs, assemblies, entrusted power enough their
 protection.
 



right monarchy scripture
 
let us now consider scripture teacheth point. to
 moses, children israel say thus. (exod. 20. 19) "speak thou to
 us, will heare thee; let god speak us, lest dye."
 absolute obedience moses. concerning right kings, god
 mouth samuel, saith, (1 sam. 8. 11, 12, &c.) "this
 shall right king will reigne you. he
 shall take sons, set drive chariots, his
 horsemen, run chariots; gather harvest; and
 make engines war, instruments chariots; shall
 take daughters make perfumes, cookes, bakers. he
 shall take fields, vine-yards, olive-yards, give
 servants. shall take tyth corne wine, and
 give men chamber, servants. shall
 take man-servants, maid-servants, choice your
 youth, employ businesse. shall take tyth your
 flocks; shall servants." absolute power, and
 summed last words, "you shall servants." againe, when
 people heard power king have, yet consented
 thereto, say thus, (verse. 19 &c.) "we will nations,
 king shall judge causes, goe us, conduct our
 wars." confirmed right soveraigns have, the
 militia, judicature; conteined absolute power,
 one man can possibly transferre another. again, prayer of
 king salomon god, this. (1 kings 3. 9) "give thy servant
 understanding, judge thy people, discerne good and
 evill." belongeth therefore soveraigne bee judge, and
 praescribe rules discerning good evill; rules are
 lawes; therefore legislative power. saul sought
 life david; yet power slay saul, his
 servants done it, david forbad them, saying (1 sam. 24. 9)
 "god forbid act lord, anoynted of
 god." obedience servants st. paul saith, (coll. 3. 20) "servants
 obey masters things," and, (verse. 22) "children obey your
 parents things." simple obedience are
 subject paternall, despoticall dominion. again, (math. 23. 2,3)
 "the scribes pharisees sit moses chayre therefore that
 shall bid observe, observe do." simple
 obedience. st. paul, (tit. 3. 2) "warn subject
 princes, authority, & obey
 them." obedience also simple. lastly, saviour himselfe
 acknowledges, men pay taxes kings imposed,
 sayes, "give caesar caesars;" payed such
 taxes himselfe. kings word, sufficient take thing
 subject, need; king judge that
 need: himselfe, king jewes, commanded disciples to
 take asse, asses colt carry jerusalem, saying, (mat.
 21. 2,3) "go village you, shall find a
 shee asse tyed, colt her, unty them, bring me.
 man ask you, mean it, say lord hath need
 them: will let go." will ask whether his
 necessity sufficient title; whether judge that
 necessity; acquiesce will lord.
 
places may added also genesis, (gen. 3. 5) "you
 shall gods, knowing good evill." verse 11. "who told thee
 thou wast naked? hast thou eaten tree, commanded
 thee thou shouldest eat?" cognisance judicature good
 evill, forbidden name fruit tree of
 knowledge, triall adams obedience; divell enflame the
 ambition woman, fruit already seemed beautifull,
 told tasting it, gods, knowing good and
 evill. whereupon eaten, indeed take upon them
 gods office, judicature good evill; acquired new
 ability distinguish aright. whereas sayd, that
 eaten, saw naked; man hath interpreted that
 place, formerly blind, saw skins: the
 meaning plain, first judged nakednesse
 (wherein gods will create them) uncomely; being
 ashamed, tacitely censure god himselfe. thereupon god saith,
 "hast thou eaten, &c." say, doest thou owest me
 obedience, take upon thee judge commandements? whereby is
 cleerly, (though allegorically,) signified, commands of
 right command, subjects be
 censured, disputed.
 



soveraign power common-wealths absolute
 
appeareth plainly, understanding, reason, and
 scripture, soveraign power, whether placed one man, in
 monarchy, one assembly men, popular, aristocraticall
 common-wealths, great, possibly men can imagined make
 it. though unlimited power, men may fancy many evill
 consequences, yet consequences want it, is
 perpetuall warre every man neighbour, much worse. the
 condition man life shall never without inconveniences; but
 happeneth common-wealth great inconvenience, what
 proceeds subjects disobedience, breach covenants,
 common-wealth being. whosoever thinking
 soveraign power great, will seek make lesse; must subject
 himselfe, power, can limit it; say, greater.
 
greatest objection is, practise; men ask, where,
 when, power subjects acknowledged. one may
 ask again, when, kingdome long free from
 sedition civill warre. nations, whose common-wealths have
 long-lived, destroyed, forraign warre, the
 subjects never dispute soveraign power. howsoever, an
 argument practise men, sifted bottom,
 exact reason weighed causes, nature common-wealths,
 suffer daily miseries, proceed ignorance
 thereof, invalid. though places world, men should
 lay foundation houses sand, thence be
 inferred, be. skill making, maintaining
 common-wealths, consisteth certain rules, doth arithmetique and
 geometry; (as tennis-play) practise onely: rules, neither
 poor men leisure, men leisure, have
 hitherto curiosity, method find out.
 


chapter xxi. liberty subjects
 



liberty what
 
liberty, freedome, signifieth (properly) absence opposition;
 (by opposition, mean externall impediments motion;) may
 applyed lesse irrational, inanimate creatures, to
 rationall. whatsoever tyed, environed, move,
 within certain space, space determined opposition
 externall body, say hath liberty go further. and
 living creatures, whilest imprisoned, restrained,
 walls, chayns; water whilest kept banks,
 vessels, otherwise spread selfe larger space, we
 use say, liberty, move manner, without
 externall impediments would. impediment of
 motion, constitution thing selfe, use to
 say, wants liberty; power move; stone lyeth
 still, man fastned bed sicknesse.
 



free
 
according proper, generally received meaning the
 word, free-man, "he, things, strength
 wit able do, hindred doe will
 to." words free, liberty, applyed thing but
 bodies, abused; subject motion, not
 subject impediment: therefore, ’tis said (for example) the
 way free, liberty way signified, walk
 without stop. say guift free, meant
 liberty guift, giver, bound any
 law, covenant give it. speak freely, the
 liberty voice, pronunciation, man, law hath
 obliged speak otherwise did. lastly, use the
 word freewill, liberty can inferred will, desire, or
 inclination, liberty man; consisteth this, that
 finds stop, will, desire, inclination
 doe.
 



feare liberty consistent
 
feare liberty consistent; man throweth goods into
 feare ship sink, doth neverthelesse very
 willingly, may refuse doe will: therefore the
 action, one free; man sometimes pays debt, for
 feare imprisonment, body hindred detaining,
 action man liberty. generally actions men
 doe common-wealths, feare law, actions, doers
 liberty omit.
 



liberty necessity consistent
 
liberty necessity consistent: water, hath not
 liberty, necessity descending channel: likewise
 actions men voluntarily doe; (because proceed
 will) proceed liberty; yet every act of
 mans will, every desire, inclination proceedeth cause,
 causes continuall chaine (whose first link hand of
 god first causes) proceed necessity. him
 see connexion causes, necessity all
 mens voluntary actions, appeare manifest. therefore god, that
 seeth, disposeth things, seeth also liberty man
 will, accompanied necessity that
 god will, & more, lesse. though men may many things,
 god command, therefore author them; yet they
 can passion, appetite thing, appetite gods
 will cause. will assure necessity mans
 will, consequently mans will dependeth, liberty
 men contradiction, impediment omnipotence and
 liberty god. shall suffice, (as matter hand) of
 naturall liberty, properly called liberty.
 



artificiall bonds, covenants
 
men, atteyning peace, conservation themselves
 thereby, made artificiall man, call common-wealth; so
 also made artificiall chains, called civill lawes, they
 themselves, mutuall covenants, fastned one end, lips
 man, assembly, given soveraigne power;
 end ears. bonds nature
 weak, may neverthelesse made hold, danger, though not
 difficulty breaking them.
 



liberty subjects consisteth liberty covenants
 
relation bonds is, speak now, the
 liberty subjects. seeing common-wealth world,
 regulating actions, words men, (as being
 thing impossible:) followeth necessarily, kinds of
 actions, laws praetermitted, men liberty, what
 reasons shall suggest, profitable themselves.
 wee take liberty proper sense, corporall liberty; that
 say, freedome chains, prison, absurd men
 clamor doe, liberty manifestly enjoy. againe,
 take liberty, exemption lawes, lesse absurd,
 men demand doe, liberty, men may
 masters lives. yet absurd is, they
 demand; knowing lawes power protect them,
 without sword hands man, men, cause laws to
 put execution. liberty subject, lyeth therefore only
 things, regulating actions, soveraign hath
 praetermitted; liberty buy, sell, otherwise
 contract one another; choose aboad, diet,
 trade life, institute children themselves
 think fit; & like.
 



liberty subject consistent unlimited power soveraign
 
neverthelesse understand, liberty, the
 soveraign power life, death, either abolished, limited. for
 already shewn, nothing soveraign representative
 can doe subject, pretence soever, can properly called
 injustice, injury; every subject author every act the
 soveraign doth; never wanteth right thing, otherwise,
 subject god, bound thereby observe
 laws nature. therefore may, doth often happen in
 common-wealths, subject may put death, command of
 soveraign power; yet neither doe wrong: jeptha
 caused daughter sacrificed: which, like cases,
 dieth, liberty doe action, is
 neverthelesse, without injury put death. holdeth also
 soveraign prince, putteth death innocent subject. for
 though action law nature, contrary to
 equitie, (as killing uriah, david;) yet an
 injurie uriah; god. uriah, right doe
 pleased, given uriah himself; yet god, because
 david gods subject; prohibited iniquitie law of
 nature. distinction, david himself, repented fact,
 evidently confirmed, saying, "to thee sinned." same
 manner, people athens, banished potent of
 common-wealth ten years, thought committed injustice;
 yet never questioned crime done; hurt he
 doe: nay commanded banishment knew whom; and
 every citizen bringing oystershell market place, written
 name desired banished, without actuall
 accusing him, sometimes banished aristides, reputation of
 justice; sometimes scurrilous jester, hyperbolus, make a
 jest it. yet man say, soveraign people athens
 wanted right banish them; athenian libertie jest, to
 just.
 



liberty writers praise, liberty soveraigns; of
 private men
 
libertie, whereof frequent, honourable mention, in
 histories, philosophy antient greeks, romans, in
 writings, discourse received all
 learning politiques, libertie particular
 men; libertie common-wealth: with
 that, every man have, civil laws,
 common-wealth all. effects also same. as
 amongst masterlesse men, perpetuall war, every man against
 neighbour; inheritance, transmit son, expect
 father; propriety goods, lands; security; a
 full absolute libertie every particular man: states, and
 common-wealths dependent one another, every common-wealth, (not
 every man) absolute libertie, doe shall judge (that is
 say, man, assemblie representeth it, shall judge)
 conducing benefit. withall, live condition
 perpetuall war, upon confines battel, their
 frontiers armed, canons planted neighbours
 round about. athenians, romanes, free; is, free
 common-wealths: particular men libertie resist
 representative; representative libertie
 resist, invade people. written turrets of
 city luca great characters day, word libertas; yet
 man can thence inferre, particular man libertie,
 immunitie service commonwealth there, in
 constantinople. whether common-wealth monarchicall, popular, the
 freedome still same.
 
easy thing, men deceived, specious name
 libertie; want judgement distinguish, mistake for
 private inheritance, birth right, right the
 publique only. errour confirmed authority of
 men reputation writings subject, wonder if
 produce sedition, change government. westerne
 parts world, made receive opinions concerning the
 institution, rights common-wealths, aristotle, cicero, and
 men, greeks romanes, living popular states, derived
 rights, principles nature, transcribed them
 books, practice common-wealths, which
 popular; grammarians describe rules language, of
 practise time; rules poetry, poems of
 homer virgil. athenians taught, (to keep them
 desire changing government,) freemen, and
 lived monarchy slaves; therefore aristotle puts it
 politiques,(lib.6.cap.2) "in democracy, liberty be
 supposed: ’tis commonly held, man free other
 government." aristotle; cicero, writers have
 grounded civill doctrine, opinions romans, were
 taught hate monarchy, first, deposed their
 soveraign, shared amongst soveraignty rome; afterwards
 successors. reading greek, latine authors,
 men childhood gotten habit (under false shew of
 liberty,) favouring tumults, licentious controlling the
 actions soveraigns; controlling controllers,
 effusion much blood; think may truly say, there
 never thing deerly bought, western parts bought
 learning greek latine tongues.
 



liberty subject measured
 
come now particulars true liberty subject; is
 say, things, though commanded soveraign, he
 may neverthelesse, without injustice, refuse do; consider,
 rights passe away, make common-wealth; (which is
 one,) liberty deny selves, owning actions
 (without exception) man, assembly make soveraign. for
 act submission, consisteth obligation, and
 liberty; must therefore inferred arguments taken from
 thence; obligation man, ariseth from
 act own; men equally, nature free. and
 arguments, must either drawn expresse words, "i
 authorise actions," intention submitteth
 himselfe power, (which intention understood end
 submitteth;) obligation, liberty subject,
 derived, either words, (or others equivalent;) or
 else end institution soveraignty; namely, peace
 subjects within themselves, defence common
 enemy.
 



subjects liberty defend bodies, even them
 lawfully invade them
 
first therefore, seeing soveraignty institution, covenant of
 every one every one; soveraignty acquisition, covenants of
 vanquished victor, child parent; manifest,
 every subject liberty things, right whereof
 covenant transferred. shewn 14.
 chapter, covenants, defend mans body, voyd.
 therefore,
 



bound hurt themselves;
 
soveraign command man (though justly condemned,) kill,
 wound, mayme himselfe; resist assault him; or
 abstain use food, ayre, medicine, thing,
 without live; yet hath man liberty disobey.
 
man interrogated soveraign, authority, concerning
 crime done himselfe, bound (without assurance pardon)
 confesse it; man (as shewn chapter) can
 obliged covenant accuse himselfe.
 
again, consent subject soveraign power, contained in
 words, "i authorise, take upon me, actions;" which
 restriction all, former naturall liberty:
 allowing kill me, bound kill selfe when
 commands me. "’tis one thing say ‘kill me, fellow, you
 please;’ another thing say, ‘i will kill selfe, fellow.’" it
 followeth therefore, that
 
man bound words themselves, either kill himselfe, or
 man; consequently, obligation man may sometimes
 have, upon command soveraign execute dangerous, or
 dishonourable office, dependeth words submission; but
 intention; understood end thereof. when
 therefore refusall obey, frustrates end the
 soveraignty ordained; liberty refuse: otherwise
 is.
 



warfare, unless voluntarily undertake it
 
upon ground, man commanded souldier fight against
 enemy, though soveraign right enough punish refusall
 death, may neverthelesse many cases refuse, without injustice;
 substituteth sufficient souldier place: this
 case deserteth service common-wealth. is
 allowance made naturall timorousnesse, onely women, (of
 dangerous duty expected,) also men feminine
 courage. armies fight, one side, both, running
 away; yet trechery, fear, not
 esteemed unjustly, dishonourably. reason, to
 avoyd battell, injustice, cowardise. inrowleth
 himselfe souldier, taketh imprest mony, taketh away excuse of
 timorous nature; obliged, onely go battell,
 also run it, without captaines leave. the
 defence common-wealth, requireth help that
 able bear arms, every one obliged; otherwise the
 institution common-wealth, purpose, or
 courage preserve, vain.
 
resist sword common-wealth, defence another man,
 guilty, innocent, man hath liberty; liberty, takes
 away soveraign, means protecting us; therefore
 destructive essence government. case great many
 men together, already resisted soveraign power unjustly, or
 committed capitall crime, every one expecteth
 death, whether liberty joyn together, and
 assist, defend one another? certainly have: defend
 lives, guilty man may well do, innocent. there
 indeed injustice first breach duty; bearing of
 arms subsequent it, though maintain done, is
 new unjust act. onely defend persons, not
 unjust all. offer pardon taketh them, it
 offered, plea self-defence, maketh perseverance in
 assisting, defending rest, unlawfull.
 



greatest liberty subjects, dependeth silence law
 

lyberties, depend silence law. cases
 soveraign prescribed rule, subject hath
 liberty do, forbeare, according discretion. and
 therefore liberty places more, lesse; in
 times more, times lesse, according the
 soveraignty shall think convenient. example, was
 time, england man might enter land,
 (and dispossesse wrongfully possessed it) force. in
 after-times, liberty forcible entry, taken away statute
 made (by king) parliament. places world, men
 liberty many wives: places, liberty not
 allowed.
 
subject controversie soveraigne, debt, or
 right possession lands goods, concerning service
 required hands, concerning penalty corporall, or
 pecuniary, grounded precedent law; hath liberty sue
 right, subject; judges,
 appointed soveraign. seeing soveraign demandeth
 force former law, vertue power; declareth
 thereby, requireth more, shall appear due that
 law. sute therefore contrary will soveraign;
 consequently subject hath liberty demand hearing of
 cause; sentence, according law. demand, or
 take thing pretence power; lyeth, case, no
 action law: done vertue power, is
 done authority every subject, consequently, brings
 action soveraign, brings himselfe.
 
monarch, soveraign assembly, grant liberty all, of
 subjects; grant standing, disabled provide their
 safety, grant voyd; unlesse directly renounce, transferre
 soveraignty another. might openly, (if been
 will,) plain termes, renounced, transferred it, and
 not; understood will; grant
 proceeded ignorance repugnancy liberty and
 soveraign power; therefore soveraignty still retayned;
 consequently powers, necessary exercising
 thereof; power warre, peace, judicature, of
 appointing officers, councellours, levying mony, rest
 named 18th chapter.
 



cases subjects absolved obedience soveraign
 
obligation subjects soveraign understood last as
 long, longer, power lasteth, able to
 protect them. right men nature protect themselves,
 none else can protect them, can covenant relinquished. the
 soveraignty soule common-wealth; departed from
 body, members doe receive motion it. end
 obedience protection; which, wheresoever man seeth it, either in
 own, anothers sword, nature applyeth obedience it, and
 endeavour maintaine it. though soveraignty, intention
 make it, immortall; yet nature, not
 subject violent death, forreign war; also through
 ignorance, passions men, hath it, very
 institution, many seeds naturall mortality, intestine discord.
 



case captivity
 
subject taken prisoner war; person, means of
 life within guards enemy, hath life corporall
 libertie given him, condition subject victor, hath
 libertie accept condition; accepted it, subject
 took him; way preserve himselfe.
 case same, deteined termes, a
 forreign country. man held prison, bonds, not
 trusted libertie bodie; understood be
 bound covenant subjection; therefore may, can, make his
 escape means whatsoever.
 



case soveraign cast government heyrs
 
monarch shall relinquish soveraignty, himself, and
 heires; subjects returne absolute libertie nature;
 because, though nature may declare sons, the
 nerest kin; yet dependeth will, (as hath said
 precedent chapter,) shall heyr. therefore will
 heyre, soveraignty, subjection. case the
 same, dye without known kindred, without declaration of
 heyre. can heire known, consequently no
 subjection due.
 



case banishment
 
soveraign banish subject; banishment, not
 subject. sent message, hath leave travell, is
 still subject; is, contract soveraigns, vertue
 covenant subjection. whosoever entreth anothers
 dominion, subject lawes thereof; unless a
 privilege amity soveraigns, speciall licence.
 



case soveraign render subject another
 
monarch subdued war, render subject victor; his
 subjects delivered former obligation, become obliged
 victor. held prisoner, liberty
 body; understood given away right of
 soveraigntie; therefore subjects obliged yield obedience
 magistrates formerly placed, governing name,
 his. for, right remaining, question the
 administration; say, magistrates officers; which,
 means name, supposed approve those, he
 formerly appointed.
 


chapter xxii. systemes subject, politicall, private
 



divers sorts systemes people

 unlawfull.
 



bodies politique power representative limited
 
bodies politique, power representative alwaies limited:
 prescribeth limits thereof, power soveraign.
 power unlimited, absolute soveraignty. soveraign, in
 every commonwealth, absolute representative subjects;
 therefore other, can representative part them,

 politique subjects, absolute representative all

 commonwealth, divide dominion, contrary peace and

 plainly, directly discharge subjection.
 consequences words, signes will, other
 consequences signes contrary; rather signes errour,
 misreckoning; mankind prone.
 
bounds power, given representative a
 bodie politique, taken notice of, two things. one is
 writt, letters soveraign: law the
 common-wealth.
 



letters patents
 
though institution acquisition common-wealth,
 independent, needs writing, power the
 representative bounds, set by
 unwritten law nature; yet subordinate bodies, such
 diversities limitation necessary, concerning businesses, times,
 places, can neither remembred without letters, taken
 notice of, unlesse letters patent, may read to
 them, withall sealed, testified, seales, other
 permanent signes authority soveraign.
 



lawes
 
limitation alwaies easie, perhaps possible
 described writing; ordinary lawes, common subjects,
 must determine, representative may lawfully do, cases,
 letters silent. therefore
 



representative one man, unwarranted acts onely
 
body politique, representative one man, whatsoever he
 person body, warranted letters,
 lawes, act, act body, of
 member thereof besides himselfe: his
 letters, lawes limit, representeth mans person, his
 own. according these, act every one: for
 act soveraign every one author, their
 representative unlimited; act recedes the
 letters soveraign, act soveraign, therefore
 every member body author it.
 



assembly, act assented onely
 
representative assembly, whatsoever assembly shall
 decree, warranted letters, lawes, act the
 assembly, body politique, act every one whose vote the
 decree made; act man present voted to
 contrary; man absent, unlesse voted procuration.
 act assembly, voted major part; if
 crime, assembly may punished, farre-forth is
 capable, dissolution, forfeiture letters (which to

 assembly common stock, wherein none innocent members have
 propriety,) pecuniary mulct. corporall penalties nature hath
 exempted bodies politique. gave vote, are
 therefore innocent, assembly represent man in
 things unwarranted letters, consequently involved
 votes.
 
representative one man, borrow mony, owe it, by
 contract; lyable onely, members person body
 politique one man, borrow mony stranger, is, one
 body, (for letters need limit borrowing,
 seeing left mens inclinations limit lending) debt is

 make members pay borroweth, consequence
 soveraignty them; therefore grant either voyd,
 proceeding errour, commonly incident humane nature, an
 unsufficient signe will granter; avowed
 him, representer soveraign, falleth the
 present question, onely bodies subordinate. member
 therefore obliged pay debt borrowed, representative
 himselfe: lendeth it, stranger letters,
 qualification body, understandeth onely for
 debtors, engaged; seeing representer can ingage

 pay him, common stock (if any), (if be
 none) estate.
 
come debt contract, mulct, case same.
 



assembly, onely liable assented
 
representative assembly, debt stranger;
 they, onely responsible debt, gave their
 votes borrowing it, contract made due, to
 fact mulct imposed; every one in
 voting engage himselfe payment: author of
 borrowing, obliged payment, even whole debt, though
 payd one, discharged.
 



debt one assembly, body onely obliged
 
debt one assembly, assembly onely obliged
 payment, common stock (if any:) having
 liberty vote, vote mony, shall borrowed, votes it
 shall payd; vote shall borrowed, absent, yet

 vote, obliged later, becomes borrower lender,
 consequently demand payment particular man, but
 common treasure onely; fayling hath remedy, nor

 assembly, means pay, enforced, did
 neverthelesse folly lend mony.
 



protestation decrees bodies politique
 
sometimes lawful; soveraign power never manifest by
 this, bodies politique subordinate, subject soveraign
 power, sometimes onely lawfull, expedient, a
 particular man make open protestation decrees the
 representative assembly, cause dissent registred, to
 take witnesse it; otherwise may obliged pay debts
 contracted, responsible crimes committed men: in
 soveraign assembly, liberty taken away, that
 protesteth there, denies soveraignty; also whatsoever
 commanded soveraign power, subject (though not
 alwayes sight god) justified command; such
 command every subject author.
 



bodies politique government province, colony, town
 
variety bodies politique, almost infinite; are
 onely distinguished severall affaires, are
 constituted, wherein unspeakable diversitie; also the
 times, places, numbers, subject many limitations. their
 affaires, ordained government; first, government
 province may committed assembly men, wherein all
 resolutions shall depend votes major part; this
 assembly body politique, power limited commission.
 word province signifies charge, care businesse, he
 whose businesse is, committeth another man, administred for,
 him; therefore one common-wealth divers
 countries, lawes distinct one another, farre
 distant place, administration government committed
 divers persons, countries soveraign resident,
 governs commission, called provinces. government
 province, assembly residing province selfe, there
 examples. romans soveraignty many provinces;
 yet governed alwaies presidents, praetors; by
 assemblies, governed city rome, territories adjacent.
 like manner, colonies sent england, plant
 virginia, sommer-ilands; though government here, were
 committed assemblies london, yet assemblies never
 commit government assembly there; each
 plantation send one governour; though every man, can be
 present nature, desires participate government; yet where
 present, nature also enclined, commit the
 government common interest rather monarchicall, a
 popular form government: also evident men have
 great private estates; unwilling take paines of
 administring businesse belongs them, choose rather trust
 one servant, assembly either friends servants.
 howsoever fact, yet may suppose government a
 province, colony committed assembly: is, which
 place say, this; whatsoever debt that
 assembly contracted; whatsoever unlawfull act decreed, act
 onely assented, dissented, were
 absent, reasons alledged. also assembly residing
 bounds colony whereof government,
 execute power persons, goods the
 colonie, seize debt, duty, place
 without colony selfe, jurisdiction, authoritie
 elsewhere, left remedie, law place
 alloweth them. though assembly right, impose mulct
 upon members, shall break lawes make; yet
 colonie selfe, right execute same.
 said here, rights assembly, the
 government province, colony, appliable also assembly
 government town, university, college, church,
 government persons men.
 
generally, bodies politique, particular member
 conceive injured body self, cognisance his
 cause belongeth soveraign, soveraign hath ordained
 judges causes, shall ordaine particular cause;
 body self. whole body case his
 fellow subject, soveraign assembly, otherwise: there,
 soveraign judge, though cause, can no
 judge all.
 



bodies politique ordering trade
 
bodie politique, well ordering forraigne traffique, the
 commodious representative assembly members; that
 say, one, every one adventureth mony, may be
 present deliberations, resolutions body, they
 will themselves. proof whereof, consider end, for
 men merchants, may buy sell, export, import
 merchandise, according discretions, doe neverthelesse
 bind one corporation. true, few
 merchants, merchandise buy home, can fraight a
 ship, export it; buy abroad, bring home; and
 therefore need joyn together one society; every man
 may either participate gaine, according proportion his
 adventure; take own; sell transports, imports, at
 prices thinks fit. body politique, being
 common representative oblige law, that
 common subjects. end incorporating,
 make gaine greater; done two wayes; sole
 buying, sole selling, home, abroad. grant
 company merchants corporation, body politique, to
 grant double monopoly, whereof one sole buyers; another
 sole sellers. company incorporate any
 particular forraign country, export commodities vendible
 country; sole buying home, sole selling abroad.
 home one buyer, abroad one selleth:
 gainfull merchant, thereby buy home
 lower, sell abroad higher rates: abroad one
 buyer forraign merchandise, one sels home; both
 againe gainfull adventurers.
 
double monopoly one part disadvantageous people at
 home, forraigners. home sole exportation
 set price please husbandry handy-works of
 people; sole importation, price please all
 forraign commodities people need of; ill the
 people. contrary, sole selling native commodities
 abroad, sole buying forraign commodities upon place,
 raise price those, abate price these, to
 disadvantage forraigner: one selleth, the
 merchandise dearer; one buyeth cheaper: such
 corporations therefore monopolies; though would
 profitable common-wealth, bound one body
 forraigne markets liberty home, every man buy, and
 sell price could.
 
end bodies merchants, common benefit
 whole body, (which case common stock, what
 deducted particular adventures, building, buying,
 victualling manning ships,) particular gaine of
 every adventurer, reason every one acquainted the
 employment own; is, every one assembly, that
 shall power order same; acquainted their
 accounts. therefore representative body must be
 assembly, every member body may present the
 consultations, will.
 
body politique merchants, contract debt stranger the
 act representative assembly, every member lyable himself
 whole. stranger can take notice private lawes,
 considereth many particular men, obliged every one the
 whole payment, till payment made one dischargeth rest: if
 debt one company, creditor debter whole
 himself, therefore demand debt, the
 common stock, any.
 
common-wealth impose tax upon body, understood be
 layd upon every member proportionably particular adventure the
 company. case common stock, is
 made particular adventures.
 
mulct layd upon body unlawfull act, are
 lyable whose votes act decreed, whose assistance was
 executed; none rest crime being
 body; crime, (because body ordeyned the
 authority common-wealth,) his.
 
one members indebted body, may sued the
 body; goods taken, person imprisoned the
 authority body; authority common-wealth:
 can doe authority, can own
 authority give judgement debt due, much be
 judge cause.
 



bodie politique counsel give soveraign
 
bodies made government men, traffique, either
 perpetuall, time prescribed writing. bodies
 also whose times limited, nature their
 businesse. example, soveraign monarch, soveraign assembly,
 shall think fit give command towns, severall parts
 territory, send deputies, enforme the
 condition, necessities subjects, advise for
 making good lawes, cause, one person
 representing whole country, deputies, place time
 meeting assigned them, there, time, body politique,
 representing every subject dominion; onely such
 matters shall propounded unto man, assembly, that
 soveraign authority sent them; shall declared
 nothing shall propounded, debated them, body is
 dissolved. absolute representative people,
 soveraign assembly; two soveraign
 assemblies, two soveraigns, people; cannot
 consist peace. therefore a
 soveraignty, can absolute representation people, but
 it. limits farre body shall represent the
 whole people, set forth writing sent
 for. people choose deputies intent, than
 writing directed soveraign expressed.
 



regular private body, lawfull, family
 
private bodies regular, lawfull, constituted
 without letters, written authority, saving lawes common
 subjects. united one person
 representative, held regular; families, in
 father, master ordereth whole family. obligeth
 children, servants, farre law permitteth, though not
 further, none bound obedience actions,
 law hath forbidden done. actions, during
 time domestique government, subject their
 fathers, masters, immediate soveraigns. father,
 master institution common-wealth, absolute
 soveraigns families, lose afterward their
 authority, law common-wealth taketh them.
 



private bodies regular, unlawfull
 
private bodies regular, unlawfull, unite themselves
 one person representative, without publique authority all;
 corporations beggars, theeves gipsies, better
 order trade begging, stealing; corporations of
 men, authority forraign person, unite in
 anothers dominion, easier propagation doctrines, making a
 party, power common-wealth.
 



systemes irregular, private leagues
 
irregular systemes, nature, leagues, sometimes meer
 concourse people, without union particular designe, by
 obligation one another, proceeding onely similitude of
 wills inclinations, become lawfull, unlawfull, according the
 lawfulnesse, unlawfulnesse every particular mans design therein:
 designe understood occasion.
 
leagues subjects, (because leagues commonly made mutuall
 defence,) common-wealth (which league of
 subjects together) part unnecessary, savour of
 unlawfull designe; cause unlawfull, go commonly by
 name factions, conspiracies. league connexion of
 men covenants, power given one man assembly,
 (as condition meer nature) compell performance,
 long onely valid, ariseth just cause distrust: and
 therefore leagues common-wealths, humane
 power established, keep awe, onely lawfull, but
 also profitable time last. leagues subjects of
 one common-wealth, every one may obtain right
 means soveraign power, unnecessary maintaining of
 peace justice, (in case designe evill, unknown
 common-wealth) unlawfull. uniting strength private
 men, is, evill intent, unjust; intent unknown, dangerous
 publique, unjustly concealed.
 



secret cabals
 
soveraign power great assembly, number men,
 part assembly, without authority, consult part, contrive
 guidance rest; faction, conspiracy unlawfull,
 fraudulent seducing assembly particular
 interest. he, whose private interest debated, and
 judged assembly, make many friends can; is
 injustice; case part assembly. and
 though hire friends mony, (unlesse expresse law
 it,) yet injustice. sometimes, (as mens manners
 are,) justice without mony; every man may think his
 cause just, till heard, judged.
 



feuds private families
 
common-wealths, private man entertain servants, than
 government estate, lawfull employment them
 requires, faction, unlawfull. protection the
 common-wealth, needeth defence private force. whereas
 nations throughly civilized, severall numerous families have
 lived continuall hostility, invaded one another private
 force; yet evident enough, done unjustly; else
 common-wealth.
 



factions government
 
factions kindred, also factions government of
 religion, papists, protestants, &c. state, patricians,
 plebeians old time rome, aristocraticalls and
 democraticalls old time greece, unjust, contrary to
 peace safety people, taking sword the
 hand soveraign.
 
concourse people, irregular systeme, lawfulnesse, or
 unlawfulnesse, whereof dependeth occasion, number of
 assembled. occasion lawfull, manifest, the
 concourse lawfull; usuall meeting men church, a
 publique shew, usuall numbers: numbers extraordinarily
 great, occasion evident; consequently cannot
 render particular good account amongst them, to
 judged conscious unlawfull, tumultuous designe. may be
 lawfull thousand men, joyn petition delivered a
 judge, magistrate; yet thousand men come present it, is
 tumultuous assembly; needs one two that
 purpose. cases these, set number makes
 assembly unlawfull, number, present officers are
 able suppresse, bring justice.
 
unusuall number men, assemble man accuse;
 assembly unlawfull tumult; may deliver their
 accusation magistrate few, one man. case
 st. paul ephesus; demetrius, great number other
 men, brought two pauls companions magistrate, saying with
 one voyce, "great diana ephesians;" way of
 demanding justice teaching people doctrine,
 religion, trade. occasion here, considering
 lawes people, just; yet assembly judged
 unlawfull, magistrate reprehended it, these
 words,(acts 19. 40) "if demetrius work-men can accuse any
 man, thing, pleas, deputies, let accuse one
 another. thing demand, case may
 judged assembly lawfully called. danger be
 accused dayes sedition, because, cause any
 man can render reason concourse people." calleth
 assembly, whereof men can give just account, sedition, such
 answer for. shall say concerning
 systemes, assemblyes people, may compared (as said,)
 similar parts mans body; lawfull, muscles;
 unlawfull, wens, biles, apostemes, engendred the
 unnaturall conflux evill humours.
 


chapter xxiii. publique ministers soveraign power
 

last chapter spoken similar parts a
 common-wealth; shall speak parts organicall, are
 publique ministers.
 



publique minister who
 
publique minister, he, soveraign, (whether monarch,
 assembly,) employed affaires, authority to
 represent employment, person common-wealth. and
 whereas every man, assembly hath soveraignty, representeth
 two persons, (as common phrase is) two capacities, one
 naturall, another politique, (as monarch, hath person not
 onely common-wealth, also man; soveraign assembly
 hath person onely common-wealth, also the
 assembly); servants naturall capacity,
 publique ministers; onely serve the
 administration publique businesse. therefore neither ushers,
 sergeants, officers waite assembly, for
 purpose, commodity men assembled, an
 aristocracy, democracy; stewards, chamberlains, cofferers, any
 officers houshold monarch, publique ministers a
 monarchy.
 



ministers generall administration
 
publique ministers, charge committed general
 administration, either whole dominion, part thereof.
 whole, protector, regent, may bee committed by
 predecessor infant king, minority, whole
 administration kingdome. case, every subject far
 obliged obedience, ordinances shall make, commands
 shall give kings name, inconsistent his
 soveraigne power. part, province; either monarch, or
 soveraign assembly, shall give generall charge thereof a
 governour, lieutenant, praefect, vice-roy: case also,
 every one province, obliged shall doe name
 soveraign, incompatible soveraigns right.
 protectors, vice-roys, governours, right, but
 depends soveraigns will; commission can given
 them, can interpreted declaration will transferre the
 soveraignty, without expresse perspicuous words purpose. and
 kind publique ministers resembleth nerves, tendons that
 move severall limbs body naturall.
 



speciall administration, oeconomy
 
others speciall administration; say, charges some
 speciall businesse, either home, abroad: home, first, for
 oeconomy common-wealth, authority concerning the
 treasure, tributes, impositions, rents, fines, whatsoever publique
 revenue, collect, receive, issue, take accounts thereof,
 publique ministers: ministers, serve person
 representative, can doe nothing command, without his
 authority: publique, serve politicall capacity.
 
secondly, authority concerning militia; the
 custody armes, forts, ports; levy, pay, conduct souldiers; or
 provide necessary thing use war, either land or
 sea, publique ministers. souldier without command, though he
 fight common-wealth, therefore represent person of
 it; none represent to. every one hath
 command, represents commandeth.
 



instruction people
 
also authority teach, enable others teach
 people duty soveraign power, instruct the
 knowledge just, unjust, thereby render apt
 live godlinesse, peace among themselves, resist the
 publique enemy, publique ministers: ministers, doe it
 authority, anothers; publique, they
 doe (or doe it) authority, soveraign.
 monarch, soveraign assembly hath immediate authority
 god, teach instruct people; man the
 soveraign, receiveth power dei gratia simply; say, from
 favour none god: other, receive favour
 providence god, soveraigns; monarchy dei gratia
 & regis; dei providentia & voluntate regis.
 



judicature
 
also jurisdiction given, publique ministers. in
 seats justice represent person soveraign; and
 sentence, sentence; (as hath declared) all
 judicature essentially annexed soveraignty; therefore all
 judges ministers him, soveraign
 power. controversies two sorts, namely fact, of
 law; judgements, fact, law: consequently in
 controversie, may two judges, one fact, another of
 law.
 
controversies, may arise controversie between
 party judged, judge; subjects to
 soveraign, equity judged men agreed consent
 both; man can judge cause. soveraign
 already agreed judge both, therefore either to
 heare cause, determine himself, appoint judge as
 shall agree on. agreement understood be
 made divers wayes; first, defendant allowed
 except judges, whose interest maketh suspect
 them, (for complaynant hath already chosen judge,)
 excepteth against, judges agrees on.
 secondly, appeale judge, can appeale further;
 appeale choice. thirdly, appeale soveraign
 himself, himself, delegates parties shall
 agree on, give sentence; sentence finall: defendant is
 judged judges, say, himself.
 
properties just rationall judicature considered, cannot
 forbeare observe excellent constitution courts justice,
 established common, also publique pleas england. by
 common pleas, meane those, complaynant defendant
 subjects: publique, (which also called pleas the
 crown) those, complaynant soveraign. whereas there
 two orders men, whereof one lords, commons; the
 lords priviledge, judges capitall crimes,
 none lords; them, many present; being
 ever acknowledged priviledge favour, judges none but
 desired. controversies, every
 subject (as also civill controversies lords) judges, men
 country matter controversie lay; he
 might make exceptions, till last twelve men without exception
 agreed on, judged twelve. having
 judges, nothing alledged party, the
 sentence finall, publique persons, authority
 soveraign power, either instruct, judge people,
 members common-wealth, may fitly compared the
 organs voice body naturall.
 



execution
 
publique ministers also those, authority the
 soveraign, procure execution judgements given; publish the
 soveraigns commands; suppresse tumults; apprehend, imprison
 malefactors; acts tending conservation the
 peace. every act doe authority, act the
 common-wealth; service, answerable hands, a
 bodie naturall.
 
publique ministers abroad, represent person their
 soveraign, forraign states. ambassadors, messengers,
 agents, heralds, sent publique authoritie, publique
 businesse.
 
sent authoritie private partie a
 troubled state, though received, neither publique, nor
 private ministers common-wealth; none actions
 common-wealth author. likewise, ambassador sent a
 prince, congratulate, condole, assist solemnity, though
 authority publique; yet businesse private, and
 belonging naturall capacity; private person. also if
 man sent another country, secretly explore counsels,
 strength; though authority, businesse publique;
 yet none take notice person him, but
 own; private minister; yet minister the
 common-wealth; may compared eye body naturall. and
 appointed receive petitions informations
 people, publique eare, publique
 ministers, represent soveraign office.
 



counsellers without employment advise publique
 ministers
 
neither counsellor, councell state, consider with
 authority judicature command, giving advice to
 soveraign required, offering not
 required, publique person. advice addressed the
 soveraign only, whose person presence, represented
 him, another. body counsellors, never without some
 authority, either judicature, immediate administration:
 monarchy, represent monarch, delivering commands
 publique ministers: democracy, councell, senate
 propounds result deliberations people, a
 councell; appoint judges, heare causes, give
 audience ambassadors, quality minister the
 people: aristocracy councell state soveraign
 assembly self; gives counsell none themselves.
 


chapter xxiv. nutrition, procreation common-wealth
 


nourishment common-wealth consisteth commodities
 
land
 
nutrition common-wealth consisteth, plenty, and
 distribution materials conducing life: concoction, or
 preparation; (when concocted) conveyance it, convenient
 conduits, publique use.
 
plenty matter, thing limited nature, those
 commodities, (the two breasts common mother) land,
 sea, god usually either freely giveth, labour selleth to
 man-kind.
 
matter nutriment, consisting animals, vegetals, and
 minerals, god hath freely layd us, neer face of
 earth; needeth labour, industry
 receiving them. insomuch plenty dependeth (next gods favour)
 meerly labour industry men.
 
matter, commonly called commodities, partly native, partly
 forraign: native, within territory of
 common-wealth; forraign, imported without. and
 territory dominion one common-wealth,
 (except vast extent,) produceth things needfull
 maintenance, motion whole body; produce
 something necessary; superfluous commodities had
 within, become superfluous, supply wants home, by
 importation may abroad, either exchange, or
 just warre, labour: mans labour also, commodity
 exchangeable benefit, well thing: have
 common-wealths territory, hath served
 habitation, neverthelesse, onely maintained, also
 encreased power, partly labour trading one place to
 another, partly selling manifactures, whereof materials
 brought places.
 



right distribution them
 
distribution materials nourishment, the
 constitution mine, thine, his, say, one word
 propriety; belongeth kinds common-wealth soveraign
 power. common-wealth, is, (as hath been
 already shewn) perpetuall warre every man neighbour;
 therefore every thing getteth it, keepeth by
 force; neither propriety community; uncertainty. which
 evident, even cicero, (a passionate defender liberty,) in
 publique pleading, attributeth propriety law civil, "let
 civill law," saith he, "be abandoned, negligently
 guarded, (not say oppressed,) nothing, man can
 sure receive ancestor, leave children." and
 again; "take away civill law, man knows own, and
 another mans." seeing therefore introduction propriety is
 effect common-wealth; can nothing person that
 represents it, act onely soveraign; consisteth in
 lawes, none can make soveraign power. and
 well knew old, called nomos, (that say,
 distribution,) call law; defined justice, distributing
 every man own.
 



private estates land proceed originally arbitrary
 distribution soveraign
 
distribution, first law, division land it
 selfe: wherein soveraign assigneth every man portion, according
 he, according subject, number them, shall
 judge agreeable equity, common good. children israel,
 common-wealth wildernesse; wanted commodities
 earth, till masters land promise; which
 afterward divided amongst them, discretion, but
 discretion eleazar priest, joshua generall: who
 twelve tribes, making thirteen subdivision of
 tribe joseph; made neverthelesse twelve portions land;
 ordained tribe levi land; assigned tenth
 part whole fruits; division therefore arbitrary. and
 though people comming possession land warre, not
 alwaies exterminate antient inhabitants, (as jewes,) but
 leave many, most, estates; yet manifest
 hold afterwards, victors distribution; people
 england held william conquerour.
 



propriety subject excludes dominion soveraign, but
 onely another subject
 
whence may collect, propriety subject hath in
 lands, consisteth right exclude subjects the
 use them; exclude soveraign, assembly, or
 monarch. seeing soveraign, say, common-wealth
 (whose person representeth,) understood nothing order
 common peace security, distribution lands, be
 understood done order same: consequently, whatsoever
 distribution shall make prejudice thereof, contrary the
 will every subject, committed peace, safety his
 discretion, conscience; therefore will every one of
 them, reputed voyd. true, soveraign monarch, or
 greater part soveraign assembly, may ordain many
 things pursuit passions, contrary consciences,
 breach trust, law nature; not
 enough authorise subject, either make warre upon, much
 accuse injustice, way speak evill soveraign;
 authorised actions, bestowing the
 soveraign power, made own. cases commands
 soveraigns contrary equity, law nature, be
 considered hereafter another place.
 



publique dieted
 
distribution land, common-wealth selfe, may be
 conceived portion, possesse, improve by
 representative; portion may made sufficient, to
 susteine whole expence common peace, defence necessarily
 required: true, representative
 conceived free humane passions, infirmities. nature
 men is, setting forth publique land, any
 certaine revenue common-wealth, vaine; tendeth the
 dissolution government, condition meere nature, and
 war, assoon ever soveraign power falleth hands a
 monarch, assembly, either negligent mony, or
 hazardous engaging publique stock, long, costly
 war. common-wealths can endure diet: seeing expence is
 limited appetite, externall accidents, the
 appetites neighbours, publique riches limited by
 limits, emergent occasions shall require. and
 whereas england, conquerour, divers lands
 reserved use, (besides forrests, chases, either his
 recreation, preservation woods,) divers services reserved
 land gave subjects; yet seems reserved
 maintenance publique, naturall capacity: for
 he, successors that, lay arbitrary taxes all
 subjects land, judged necessary. publique
 lands, services, ordained sufficient maintenance the
 common-wealth, contrary scope institution; being
 (as appeared ensuing taxes) insufficient, (as it
 appeares late revenue crown) subject alienation,
 diminution. therefore vaine, assign portion the
 common-wealth; may sell, give away; sell, give
 away tis done representative.
 



places matter traffique depend, distribution, on
 soveraign
 
distribution lands home; also assigne places,
 commodities, subject shall traffique abroad, belongeth
 soveraign. belong private persons use their
 discretion therein, bee drawn gaine, both
 furnish enemy means hurt common-wealth, hurt it
 themselves, importing things, pleasing mens appetites, be
 neverthelesse noxious, least unprofitable them. therefore
 belongeth common-wealth, (that is, soveraign only,)
 approve, disapprove places, matter forraign
 traffique.
 



laws transferring property belong also soveraign
 
further, seeing enough sustentation common-wealth,
 every man propriety portion land, few
 commodities, naturall property usefull art, no
 art world, necessary either being, well being
 almost every particular man; necessary, men distribute
 can spare, transferre propriety therein,
 mutually one another, exchange, mutuall contract. and
 therefore belongeth common-wealth, (that say, the
 soveraign,) appoint manner, kinds contract between
 subjects, (as buying, selling, exchanging, borrowing, lending, letting,
 taking hire,) bee made; words, signes they
 shall understood valid. matter, distribution of
 nourishment, severall members common-wealth, thus much
 (considering modell whole worke) sufficient.
 



mony bloud common-wealth
 
concoction, understand reducing commodities, are
 presently consumed, reserved nourishment time come, to
 thing equal value, withall portably, hinder
 motion men place place; end man may in
 place soever, nourishment place affordeth. is
 nothing else gold, silver, mony. gold silver, being
 (as happens) almost countries world highly valued, a
 commodious measure value things else nations; and
 mony (of matter soever coyned soveraign common-wealth,)
 sufficient measure value things else, the
 subjects common-wealth. means measures, all
 commodities, moveable, immoveable, made accompany man, to
 places resort, within without place his
 ordinary residence; passeth man man, within the
 common-wealth; goes round about, nourishing (as passeth)
 every part thereof; much concoction, the
 sanguification common-wealth: naturall bloud like
 manner made fruits earth; circulating, nourisheth by
 way, every member body man.
 
silver gold, value matter self;
 first priviledge, value be
 altered power one, common-wealths; a
 common measure commodities places. base mony, may
 easily enhanced, abased. secondly, priviledge to
 make common-wealths, move, stretch armes, need is,
 forraign countries; supply, private subjects that
 travell, also whole armies provision. coyne, is
 considerable matter, stamp place, being
 unable endure change ayr, hath effect home only; where
 also subject change laws, thereby value
 diminished, prejudice many times it.
 



conduits way mony publique use
 
conduits, wayes conveyed publique use, are
 two sorts; one, conveyeth publique coffers; other,
 issueth againe publique payments. first
 sort, collectors, receivers, treasurers; second the
 treasurers againe, officers appointed payment severall
 publique private ministers. also, artificiall man
 maintains resemblance naturall; whose veins receiving the
 bloud severall parts body, carry heart; where
 made vitall, heart arteries sends again, to
 enliven, enable motion members same.
 



children common-wealth colonies
 
procreation, children common-wealth, call
 plantations, colonies; numbers men sent the
 common-wealth, conductor, governour, inhabit forraign
 country, either formerly voyd inhabitants, made voyd then, by
 warre. colony setled, either common-wealth of
 themselves, discharged subjection soveraign sent
 them, (as hath done many common-wealths antient time,) in
 case common-wealth went called their
 metropolis, mother, requires them, fathers
 require children, emancipate, make free their
 domestique government, honour, friendship; else they
 remain united metropolis, colonies people of
 rome; common-wealths themselves, provinces, and
 parts common-wealth sent them. right colonies
 (saving honour, league metropolis,) dependeth wholly on
 licence, letters, soveraign authorised to
 plant.
 


chapter xxv. counsell
 



counsell what
 
fallacious judge nature things, ordinary
 inconstant use words, appeareth nothing more, the
 confusion counsels, commands, arising imperative manner
 speaking both, many occasions besides. the
 words "doe this," words onely commandeth; but
 also giveth counsell; exhorteth; yet
 few, see not, different things;
 distinguish them, perceive it
 speaketh, speech directed, upon what
 occasion. finding phrases mens writings, not
 able, willing enter consideration circumstances,
 mistake sometimes precepts counsellours, precepts
 command; sometimes contrary; according best
 agreeth conclusions inferre, actions
 approve. avoyd mistakes, render termes
 commanding, counselling, exhorting, proper distinct
 significations, define thus.
 



differences command counsell
 
command is, man saith, "doe this," "doe not," without
 expecting reason will sayes it. it
 followeth manifestly, commandeth, pretendeth thereby his
 benefit: reason command will onely, and
 proper object every mans will, good himselfe.
 
counsell, man saith, "doe" "doe this," deduceth
 reasons benefit arriveth he
 saith it. evident, giveth counsell,
 pretendeth onely (whatsoever intendeth) good him, he
 giveth it.
 
therefore counsell command, one great difference is, that
 command directed mans benefit; counsell benefit
 another man. ariseth another difference, man
 may obliged commanded; hath covenanted
 obey: obliged counselled, the
 hurt following it, own; covenant follow
 it, counsell turned nature command. third
 difference is, man can pretend right of
 another mans counsell; pretend benefit to
 himselfe; demand right counsell another, argues will know
 designes, gain good himselfe; (as said
 before) every mans will proper object.
 
also incident nature counsell; whatsoever be,
 asketh it, equity accuse, punish it: ask
 counsell another, permit give counsell shall
 think best; consequently, giveth counsell soveraign,
 (whether monarch, assembly) asketh it, equity
 punished it, whether conformable opinion of
 most, not, proposition debate. the
 sense assembly can taken notice of, debate be
 ended, neither ask, take counsell; the
 sense assembly, resolution debate, end all
 deliberation. generally demandeth counsell, author it;
 therefore punish it; soveraign cannot, man
 else can. one subject giveth counsell another, any
 thing contrary lawes, whether counsell proceed from
 evill intention, ignorance onely, punishable the
 common-wealth; ignorance law, good excuse, where
 every man bound take notice lawes subject.
 



exhortation dehortation what
 
exhortation, dehortation, counsell, accompanied signes in
 giveth it, vehement desire followed; say it
 briefly, counsell vehemently pressed. exhorteth, doth
 deduce consequences adviseth done, tye
 himselfe therein rigour true reasoning; encourages he
 counselleth, action: dehorteth, deterreth it. and
 therefore speeches, regard common passions,
 opinions men, deducing reasons; make use of
 similitudes, metaphors, examples, tooles oratory, to
 perswade hearers utility, honour, justice following
 advise.
 
whence may inferred, first, exhortation dehortation,
 directed good giveth counsell, that
 asketh it, contrary duty counsellour; (by the
 definition counsell) regard, benefits, his
 adviseth. directeth counsell own
 benefit, manifest enough, long vehement urging, by
 artificial giving thereof; required him, and
 consequently proceeding occasions, directed principally
 benefit, accidentarily good is
 counselled, all.
 
secondly, use exhortation dehortation lyeth onely, where
 man speak multitude; speech addressed
 one, may interrupt him, examine reasons rigorously,
 can done multitude; many enter into
 dispute, dialogue speaketh indifferently them
 once. thirdly, exhort dehort, are
 required give counsell, corrupt counsellours, were
 bribed interest. though counsell give never
 good; yet gives it, good counsellour, he
 giveth just sentence reward, just judge. a
 man may lawfully command, father family, leader an
 army, exhortations dehortations, onely lawfull, but
 also necessary, laudable: counsells, but
 commands; execution soure labour; sometimes
 necessity, alwayes humanity requireth sweetned the
 delivery, encouragement, tune phrase counsell,
 rather harsher language command.
 
examples difference command counsell, may take
 formes speech expresse holy scripture. "have no
 gods me; make thy selfe graven image; take gods name
 vain; sanctifie sabbath; honour thy parents; kill not; steale
 not," &c. commands; reason obey
 them, drawn will god king, obliged to
 obey. words, "sell thou hast; give poore; and
 follow me," counsell; reason do
 so, drawn benefit; this, shall have
 "treasure heaven." words, "go village against
 you, shall find asse tyed, colt; loose her, bring
 me," command: reason fact drawn from
 will master: words, "repent, baptized in
 name jesus," counsell; reason so
 do, tendeth benefit god almighty, shall still king
 manner soever rebell; selves, other
 means avoyding punishment hanging us sins.
 



differences fit unfit counsellours
 
difference counsell command, hath now deduced from
 nature counsell, consisting deducing benefit, or
 hurt may arise counselled, necessary
 probable consequences action propoundeth; may also the
 differences apt, inept counsellours derived the
 same. experience, memory consequences like
 actions formerly observed, counsell speech whereby that
 experience made known another; vertues, defects of
 counsell, vertues, defects intellectuall:
 person common-wealth, counsellours serve the
 place memory, mentall discourse. resemblance the
 common-wealth, naturall man, one dissimilitude joyned,
 great importance; is, naturall man receiveth his
 experience, naturall objects sense, work upon him
 without passion, interest own; whereas give
 counsell representative person common-wealth, may have,
 often particular ends, passions, render their
 counsells alwayes suspected, many times unfaithfull. therefore
 may set first condition good counsellour, his
 ends, interest, inconsistent ends interest of
 counselleth.
 
secondly, office counsellour, action comes
 deliberation, make manifest consequences it, such
 manner, counselled may truly evidently informed; he
 propound advise, forme speech, may make
 truth evidently appear; say, firme
 ratiocination, significant proper language, briefly, as
 evidence will permit. therefore rash, unevident inferences;
 (such fetched onely examples, authority books, are
 arguments good, evill, witnesses fact, or
 opinion,) obscure, confused, ambiguous expressions, also all
 metaphoricall speeches, tending stirring passion, (because
 reasoning, expressions, usefull onely deceive, or
 lead counsell towards ends own) repugnant
 office counsellour.
 
thirdly, ability counselling proceedeth experience,
 long study; man presumed experience those
 things administration great common-wealth necessary
 known, man presumed good counsellour, such
 businesse, hath onely much versed in, hath also
 much meditated on, considered. seeing businesse a
 common-wealth this, preserve people home, defend them
 forraign invasion, shall find, requires great knowledge
 disposition man-kind, rights government, the
 nature equity, law, justice, honour, attained without
 study; strength, commodities, places, own
 country, neighbours; also inclinations, designes
 nations may way annoy them. attained to,
 without much experience. things, onely whole summe, but
 every one particulars requires age, observation man
 years, ordinary study. wit required counsel,
 said judgement. differences men that
 point come different education, one kind study, or
 businesse, others another. thing,
 infallible rules, (as engines, edifices, rules of
 geometry,) experience world equall counsell,
 learnt, found rule. rule,
 hath experience particular kind businesse, has
 therein best judgement, best counsellour.
 
fourthly, able give counsell common-wealth, businesse
 hath reference another common-wealth, necessary be
 acquainted intelligences, letters come thence,
 records treaties, transactions state
 them; none can doe, representative
 shall think fit. may see, called to
 counsell, can good counsell cases obtrude.
 
fifthly, supposing number counsellors equall, man better
 counselled hearing apart, assembly; many
 causes. first, hearing apart, advice every man;
 assembly may deliver advise i, no, or
 hands, feet, moved sense, the
 eloquence another, feare displeasing spoken,
 whole assembly, contradiction; feare appearing
 duller apprehension, applauded contrary
 opinion. secondly, assembly many, choose be
 whose interests contrary publique; these
 interests make passionate, passion eloquent, eloquence
 drawes others advice. passions men, which
 asunder moderate, heat one brand; assembly like
 many brands, enflame one another, (especially blow one
 another orations) setting common-wealth fire,
 pretence counselling it. thirdly, hearing every man apart,
 one may examine (when need) truth, probability of
 reasons, grounds advise gives, frequent
 interruptions, objections; done assembly,
 (in every difficult question) man rather astonied, dazled
 variety discourse upon it, informed course he
 take. besides, assembly many, called
 together advice, wherein some, ambition
 thought eloquent, also learned politiques; give not
 advice care businesse propounded, applause
 motly orations, made divers colored threds, shreds of
 authors; impertinence least, takes away time
 serious consultation, secret way counselling apart, is
 easily avoided. fourthly, deliberations kept secret,
 (whereof many occasions publique businesse,) counsells
 many, especially assemblies, dangerous; therefore
 great assemblies necessitated commit affaires lesser
 numbers, persons versed, whose fidelity
 confidence.
 
conclude, far approves taking counsell
 great assembly counsellours, wisheth for, accept
 pains, question marrying children,
 disposing lands, governing household, managing his
 private estate, especially amongst wish not
 prosperity? man doth businesse help many and
 prudent counsellours, every one consulting apart proper
 element, best, useth able seconds tennis play,
 placed proper stations. next best, useth own
 judgement only; second all. carried
 businesse framed counsell, move
 plurality consenting opinions, execution whereof is
 commonly (out envy, interest) retarded part dissenting,
 worst all, like one carried ball, though
 good players, yet wheele-barrough, frame, heavy it
 self, retarded also inconcurrent judgements, endeavours
 drive it; much more, set
 hands it; all, one, amongst
 them, desire lose. though true, many eys
 see one; yet understood many counsellours;
 only, finall resolution one man. otherwise,
 many eyes see thing divers lines, apt to
 look asquint towards private benefit; desire to
 misse marke, though look two eyes, yet never
 ayme one; therefore great popular common-wealth was
 ever kept up; either forraign enemy united them; by
 reputation one eminent man amongst them; secret
 counsell few; mutuall feare equall factions; and
 open consultations assembly. little
 common-wealths, popular, monarchicall, humane
 wisdome can uphold them, longer jealousy lasteth their
 potent neighbours.
 


chapter xxvi. civill lawes
 



civill law what
 
civill lawes, understand lawes, men therefore bound to
 observe, members, this, common-wealth
 particular, common-wealth. knowledge particular
 lawes belongeth them, professe study lawes their
 severall countries; knowledge civill law generall, any
 man. antient law rome called civil law, word
 civitas, signifies common-wealth; countries, which
 roman empire, governed law, retaine
 still part thereof think fit, call part civill
 law, distinguish rest civill lawes. that
 intend speak here; designe shew what
 law here, there; law; plato, aristotle, cicero,
 divers others done, without taking upon profession of
 study law.
 
first manifest, law generall, counsell, but
 command; command man man; him, whose
 command addressed one formerly obliged obey him. for
 civill law, addeth name person commanding, is
 persona civitatis, person common-wealth.
 
considered, define civill law manner. "civill law, to
 every subject, rules, common-wealth hath commanded him,
 word, writing, sufficient sign will, make use
 of, distinction right, wrong; say, is
 contrary, contrary rule."
 
definition, nothing first sight
 evident. every man seeth, lawes addressed the
 subjects generall; particular provinces; particular
 vocations; particular men; therefore lawes, every
 command directed; none else. also,
 lawes rules just, unjust; nothing reputed
 unjust, contrary law. likewise, none can
 make lawes common-wealth; subjection the
 common-wealth only: commands, signified sufficient
 signs; man knows otherwise obey them. and
 therefore, whatsoever can definition necessary consequence
 deduced, acknowledged truth. now deduce it
 followeth.
 



soveraign legislator
 
1. legislator common-wealths, soveraign, he
 one man, monarchy, one assembly men, democracy,
 aristocracy. legislator, maketh law. the
 common-wealth only, praescribes, commandeth observation those
 rules, call law: therefore common-wealth legislator.
 common-wealth person, capacity doe thing,
 representative, (that is, soveraign;) therefore the
 soveraign sole legislator. reason, none can abrogate
 law made, soveraign; law abrogated, by
 another law, forbiddeth put execution.
 



subject civill law
 
2. soveraign common-wealth, assembly, one man, is
 subject civill lawes. power make, repeale
 lawes, may pleaseth, free himselfe subjection,
 repealing lawes trouble him, making new; and
 consequently free before. free, can free when
 will: possible person bound himselfe;
 can bind, can release; therefore bound to
 himselfe onely, bound.
 



use, law vertue time, soveraigns consent
 
3. long use obtaineth authority law, the
 length time maketh authority, will soveraign
 signified silence, (for silence sometimes argument of
 consent;) longer law, soveraign shall silent
 therein. therefore soveraign shall question right
 grounded, upon present will, upon lawes formerly
 made; length time shal bring prejudice right; the
 question shal judged equity. many unjust actions, unjust
 sentences, go uncontrolled longer time, man can remember.
 lawyers account customes law, reasonable, and
 evill customes abolished; judgement is
 reasonable, abolished, belongeth maketh
 law, soveraign assembly, monarch.
 



law nature, civill law contain other
 
4. law nature, civill law, contain other, are
 equall extent. lawes nature, consist equity,
 justice, gratitude, morall vertues depending, the
 condition meer nature (as said end 15th
 chapter,) properly lawes, qualities dispose men to
 peace, obedience. common-wealth settled, are
 actually lawes, before; commands the
 common-wealth; therefore also civill lawes: soveraign
 power obliges men obey them. differences private
 men, declare, equity, justice, morall
 vertue, make binding, need ordinances of
 soveraign power, punishments ordained shall break
 them; ordinances therefore part civill law. law of
 nature therefore part civill law common-wealths of
 world. reciprocally also, civill law part dictates
 nature. justice, say, performance covenant, and
 giving every man own, dictate law nature. but
 every subject common-wealth, hath covenanted obey civill
 law, (either one another, assemble make common
 representative, representative selfe one one, when
 subdued sword promise obedience, may receive
 life;) therefore obedience civill law part also the
 law nature. civill, naturall law different kinds, but
 different parts law; whereof one part written, called
 civill, unwritten, naturall. right nature, that
 is, naturall liberty man, may civill law abridged,
 restrained: nay, end making lawes, other, such
 restraint; without possibly peace. law
 brought world nothing else, limit naturall
 liberty particular men, manner, might hurt, but
 assist one another, joyn together common enemy.
 



provinciall lawes made custome, soveraign power
 
5. soveraign one common-wealth, subdue people have
 lived written lawes, afterwards govern the
 lawes, governed before; yet lawes the
 civill lawes victor, vanquished common-wealth, for
 legislator he, whose authority lawes first made,
 whose authority now continue lawes. therefore
 divers provinces, within dominion common-wealth,
 provinces diversity lawes, commonly called the
 customes severall province, understand such
 customes force, onely length time; were
 antiently lawes written, otherwise made known, constitutions,
 statutes soveraigns; now lawes, vertue of
 praescription time, constitutions present
 soveraigns. unwritten law, provinces dominion,
 shall generally observed, iniquity appear use thereof;
 law can law nature, equally obliging all
 man-kind.
 



foolish opinions lawyers concerning making lawes
 
6. seeing lawes, written, unwritten, authority,
 force, will common-wealth; say, the
 will representative; monarchy monarch, and
 common-wealths soveraign assembly; man may wonder from
 whence proceed opinions, found books lawyers of
 eminence severall common-wealths, directly, consequence making
 legislative power depend private men, subordinate judges.
 example, "that common law, hath controuler the
 parlament;" true onely parlament soveraign
 power, assembled, dissolved, own
 discretion. right else dissolve them, there
 right also controule them, consequently controule their
 controulings. right, controuler of
 lawes parlamentum, rex parlamento. parlament
 soveraign, assemble never many, wise men, from
 countries subject them, whatsoever cause; yet man
 will believe, assembly hath thereby acquired themselves
 legislative power. item, two arms common-wealth,
 force, justice; first whereof king; other
 deposited hands parlament. common-wealth could
 consist, force hand, justice the
 authority command govern.
 
7. law can never reason, lawyers agreed; and
 letter,(that is, every construction it,) which
 according intention legislator, law. is
 true: doubt is, whose reason is, shall received
 law. meant private reason; be
 much contradiction lawes, schooles; yet
 (as sr. ed, coke makes (sir edward coke, upon littleton lib.2. ch.6
 fol 97.b),) artificiall perfection reason, gotten long study,
 observation, experience, (as was.) possible long study
 may encrease, confirm erroneous sentences: men build on
 false grounds, build, greater ruine; of
 study, observe equall time, diligence, the
 reasons resolutions are, must remain discordant: therefore
 juris prudentia, wisedome subordinate judges;
 reason artificiall man common-wealth, and
 command, maketh law: common-wealth in
 representative one person, easily arise any
 contradiction lawes; doth, reason is
 able, interpretation, alteration, take away. courts
 justice, soveraign (which person common-wealth,)
 judgeth: subordinate judge, regard the
 reason, moved soveraign make law, sentence
 may according thereunto; soveraigns sentence;
 otherwise own, unjust one.
 



law made, also made known, law
 
8. this, law command, command consisteth in
 declaration, manifestation will commandeth, by
 voyce, writing, sufficient argument same, may
 understand, command common-wealth, law onely to
 those, means take notice it. naturall fooles,
 children, mad-men law, brute beasts;
 capable title just, unjust; had
 never power make covenant, understand consequences
 thereof; consequently never took upon authorise the
 actions soveraign, must make a
 common-wealth. nature, accident hath taken
 away notice lawes generall; also every man, whom
 accident, proceeding default, hath taken away the
 means take notice particular law, excused, observe it
 not; speak properly, law law him. therefore
 necessary, consider place, arguments, signes be
 sufficient knowledge law; say, is
 will soveraign, well monarchies, formes of
 government.
 



unwritten lawes lawes nature
 
first, law obliges subjects without
 exception, written, otherwise published places as
 may take notice thereof, law nature. whatsoever men
 take knowledge law, upon mens words, every
 one reason, must agreeable reason of
 men; law can be, law nature. lawes nature
 therefore need publishing, proclamation; contained
 one sentence, approved world, "do to
 another, thou thinkest unreasonable done another thy
 selfe."
 
secondly, law obliges condition men, one
 particular man written, published word, also it
 law nature; known arguments, signs,
 distinguish condition, subjects. for
 whatsoever law written, way published makes
 law, can known way, reason obey
 it; therefore also law civill, naturall. for
 example, soveraign employ publique minister, without written
 instructions doe; obliged take instructions the
 dictates reason; make judge, judge take notice,
 sentence according reason soveraign,
 alwaies understood equity, bound the
 law nature: ambassador, (in things conteined
 written instructions) take instruction reason
 dictates conducing soveraigns interest; of
 ministers soveraignty, publique private. which
 instructions naturall reason may comprehended one name of
 fidelity; branch naturall justice.
 
law nature excepted, belongeth essence other
 lawes, made known, every man shall obliged obey
 them, either word, writing, act, known proceed
 soveraign authority. will another, be
 understood, word, act, conjecture taken his
 scope purpose; person common-wealth, be
 supposed alwaies consonant equity reason. antient time,
 letters common use, lawes many times put into
 verse; rude people taking pleasure singing, reciting
 them, might easily reteine memory. same
 reason solomon adviseth man, bind ten commandements (prov. 7.
 3) upon ten fingers. law moses gave people
 israel renewing covenant, (deut. 11. 19) biddeth
 teach children, discoursing home, and
 upon way; going bed, rising bed; write
 upon posts, dores houses; (deut. 31. 12) to
 assemble people, man, woman, child, heare read.
 



nothing law legislator known
 
enough law written, published; also there
 manifest signs, proceedeth will soveraign.
 private men, have, think force enough to
 secure unjust designes, convoy safely ambitious
 ends, may publish lawes please, without, against
 legislative authority. therefore requisite, a
 declaration law, also sufficient signes author, and
 authority. author, legislator supposed every common-wealth
 evident, soveraign, constituted
 consent every one, supposed every one sufficiently
 known. though ignorance, security men such, the
 part, memory first constitution their
 common-wealth worn out, doe consider, whose power they
 use defended enemies, industry
 protected, righted injury done them; yet no
 man considers, can make question it, excuse can derived
 ignorance soveraignty placed. a
 dictate naturall reason, consequently evident law nature,
 man weaken power, protection whereof hath
 demanded, wittingly received others. therefore of
 soveraign, man, fault, (whatsoever evill men
 suggest,) can make doubt. difficulty consisteth evidence
 authority derived him; removing whereof, dependeth on
 knowledge publique registers, publique counsels, publique
 ministers, publique seales; lawes sufficiently
 verified.
 



difference verifying authorising
 
verifyed, say, authorised: verification, the
 testimony record; authority law; consisteth in
 command soveraign only.
 



law verifyed subordinate judge
 
therefore man question injury, depending law of
 nature; say, common equity; sentence judge,
 commission hath authority take cognisance causes, is
 sufficient verification law nature individuall case.
 though advice one professeth study law, be
 usefull avoyding contention; yet advice; tis the
 judge must tell men law, upon hearing controversy.
 



publique registers
 
question injury, crime, upon written law; every
 man recourse registers, himself, others, may (if he
 will) sufficiently enformed, doe injury, commit the
 crime, whither injury, not: nay doe so: when
 man doubts whether act goeth about, just, injust; may
 informe himself, will; unlawfull. like manner, he
 supposeth injured, case determined written law,
 may himself, others see consider; complaine
 consults law, unjustly, bewrayeth a
 disposition rather vex men, demand right.
 



letters patent, publique seale
 
question obedience publique officer; seen his
 commission, publique seale, heard read; have
 means informed it, man would, sufficient
 verification authority. every man obliged doe best
 endeavour, informe written lawes, may concerne
 future actions.
 



interpretation law dependeth soveraign power
 
legislator known; lawes, either writing, the
 light nature, sufficiently published; wanteth yet another
 materiall circumstance make obligatory. the
 letter, intendment, meaning; say, authentique
 interpretation law (which sense legislator,) in
 nature law consisteth; therefore interpretation
 lawes dependeth authority soveraign; interpreters
 can none those, soveraign, (to the
 subject oweth obedience) shall appoint. else, craft an
 interpreter, law made beare sense, contrary of
 soveraign; means interpreter becomes legislator.
 



lawes need interpretation
 
laws, written, unwritten, need interpretation.
 unwritten law nature, though easy such, without
 partiality, passion, make use naturall reason, and
 therefore leaves violators thereof without excuse; yet considering
 few, perhaps none, cases blinded by
 self love, passion, now become laws most
 obscure; consequently greatest need able interpreters.
 written laws, short, easily mis-interpreted, the
 divers significations word, two; long, obscure
 diverse significations many words: much written
 law, delivered few, many words, can well understood, without a
 perfect understanding finall causes, law was
 made; knowledge finall causes legislator. him
 therefore can knot law, insoluble; either by
 finding ends, undoe by; else making ends he
 will, (as alexander sword gordian knot,) the
 legislative power; interpreter can doe.
 



authenticall interpretation law writers
 
interpretation lawes nature, common-wealth, dependeth
 books morall philosophy. authority writers, without
 authority common-wealth, maketh opinions law,
 never true. written treatise,
 concerning morall vertues, necessity, the
 procuring, maintaining peace, though bee evident truth, not
 therefore presently law; common-wealths world,
 part civill law: though naturally reasonable; yet
 soveraigne power law: otherwise, great
 errour, call lawes nature unwritten law; whereof wee see
 many volumes published, many contradictions one
 another, themselves.
 



interpreter law judge giving sentence vivâ voce in
 every particular case
 
interpretation law nature, sentence judge
 constituted soveraign authority, heare determine such
 controversies, depend thereon; consisteth application of
 law present case. act judicature, judge
 doth consider, whither demand party, consonant
 naturall reason, equity; sentence giveth, therefore
 interpretation law nature; interpretation is
 authentique; private sentence; because
 giveth authority soveraign, whereby becomes the
 soveraigns sentence; law time, parties
 pleading.
 



sentence judge, bind him, another judge give
 like sentence like cases ever after
 
judge subordinate, soveraign, may erre
 judgement equity; afterward another like case find it
 consonant equity give contrary sentence, obliged to
 doe it. mans error becomes law; obliges persist
 it. neither (for reason) becomes law judges,
 though sworn follow it. though wrong sentence given by
 authority soveraign, know allow it, lawes as
 mutable, constitution new law, cases, every
 little circumstance same; yet lawes immutable, the
 lawes nature, lawes same, judges, the
 like cases ever after. princes succeed one another; one judge
 passeth, another commeth; nay, heaven earth shall passe; one
 title law nature shall passe; eternall law of
 god. therefore sentences precedent judges ever
 been, together make law contrary naturall equity: nor
 examples former judges, can warrant unreasonable sentence, or
 discharge present judge trouble studying equity
 (in case judge,) principles naturall
 reason. example sake, ’tis law nature, punish the
 innocent; innocent acquitteth himselfe judicially, is
 acknowledged innocent judge. put case now, man is
 accused capitall crime, seeing powers malice some
 enemy, frequent corruption partiality judges, runneth
 away feare event, afterwards taken, brought a
 legall triall, maketh sufficiently appear, guilty of
 crime, thereof acquitted, neverthelesse condemned to
 lose goods; manifest condemnation innocent. say
 therefore, place world, can an
 interpretation law nature, made law sentences of
 precedent judges, done same. judged first,
 judged unjustly; injustice can pattern judgement to
 succeeding judges. written law may forbid innocent men fly, and
 may punished flying: flying feare injury,
 taken presumption guilt, man already
 absolved crime judicially, contrary nature a
 presumption, hath place judgement given. yet set
 great lawyer common law england. "if man," saith
 he, "that innocent, accused felony, feare flyeth for
 same; albeit judicially acquitteth himselfe felony; yet
 found fled felony, shall notwithstanding his
 innocency, forfeit goods, chattels, debts, duties. as
 forfeiture them, law will admit proofe the
 presumption law, grounded upon flight." see, innocent
 man, judicially acquitted, notwithstanding innocency, (when no
 written law forbad fly) acquitall, upon presumption
 law, condemned lose goods hath. law ground upon
 flight presumption fact, (which capitall,) sentence
 capitall: presumption fact,
 lose goods? therefore law of
 england; condemnation grounded upon presumption law, but
 upon presumption judges. also law, say
 proofe shall admitted presumption law. for
 judges, soveraign subordinate, refuse heare proofe,
 refuse justice: though sentence just, yet judges
 condemn without hearing proofes offered, unjust judges; and
 presumption prejudice; man bring him
 seat justice, whatsoever precedent judgements, examples he
 shall pretend follow. things nature, wherein
 mens judgements perverted, trusting precedents: this
 enough shew, though sentence judge, law to
 party pleading, yet law judge, shall succeed
 office.
 
like manner, question meaning written lawes, is
 interpreter them, writeth commentary upon them. for
 commentaries commonly subject cavill, text; and
 therefore need commentaries; will end such
 interpretation. therefore unlesse interpreter authorised
 soveraign, subordinate judges recede,
 interpreter can ordinary judges, some
 manner, cases unwritten law; sentences
 taken plead, lawes particular case;
 bind judges, like cases give like judgements.
 judge may erre interpretation even written lawes; no
 errour subordinate judge, can change law, generall
 sentence soveraigne.
 



difference letter sentence law
 
written lawes, men use make difference letter, and
 sentence law: letter, meant whatsoever
 can gathered bare words, ’tis well distinguished. the
 significations almost words, either themselves, the
 metaphoricall use them, ambiguous; may drawn argument, to
 make many senses; onely one sense law. the
 letter, meant literall sense, letter, sentence
 intention law, one. literall sense that,
 legislator alwayes supposed equity: a
 great contumely judge think otherwise soveraigne.
 therefore, word law doe fully authorise a
 reasonable sentence, supply law nature; the
 case difficult, respit judgement till received ample
 authority. example, written law ordaineth, thrust
 house force, shall restored force: happens that
 man negligence leaves house empty, returning kept by
 force, case speciall law ordained. evident,
 case contained law: else remedy
 all; supposed intention the
 legislator. again, word law, commandeth judge according
 evidence: man accused falsly fact, judge saw
 done another; accused. case
 neither shall letter law followed condemnation of
 innocent, shall judge give sentence evidence
 witnesses; letter law contrary:
 procure soveraign another made judge, himselfe
 witnesse. incommodity follows bare words a
 written law, may lead intention law, whereby to
 interpret better; though incommodity can warrant a
 sentence law. every judge right, wrong, not
 judge commodious, incommodious common-wealth.
 



abilities required judge
 
abilities required good interpreter law, say,
 good judge, advocate; namely the
 study lawes. judge, take notice fact,
 none witnesses; also take notice the
 law, nothing statutes, constitutions soveraign,
 alledged pleading, declared authority
 soveraign power declare them; need take care
 before-hand, hee shall judge; shall bee given hee
 shall say concerning fact, witnesses; hee shall say in
 point law, shall pleadings shew it, by
 authority interpret upon place. lords parlament england
 judges, difficult causes heard determined
 them; yet much versed study lawes,
 fewer made profession them: though consulted with
 lawyers, appointed present purpose; yet
 alone authority giving sentence. like manner, in
 ordinary trialls right, twelve men common people, the
 judges, give sentence, onely fact, right; and
 pronounce simply complaynant, defendant; to
 say, judges onely fact, also right: a
 question crime, onely determine whether done, done; but
 also whether murder, homicide, felony, assault, like,
 determinations law: supposed to
 know law themselves, one hath authority enforme
 it, particular case judge of. yet they
 judge according tells them, subject thereby
 penalty; unlesse made appear, their
 consciences, corrupted reward. things make
 good judge, good interpreter lawes, are, first right
 understanding principall law nature called equity; which
 depending reading mens writings, the
 goodnesse mans naturall reason, meditation, presumed
 most, leisure, most
 inclination meditate thereon. secondly, contempt unnecessary
 riches, preferments. thirdly, able judgement devest
 himselfe feare, anger, hatred, love, compassion. fourthly,
 lastly, patience heare; diligent attention hearing; memory
 retain, digest apply hath heard.
 



divisions law
 
difference division lawes, made divers
 manners, according different methods, men have
 written them. thing dependeth nature, on
 scope writer; subservient every mans proper method.
 institutions justinian, find seven sorts civill lawes.
 
1. edicts, constitutions, epistles prince, is, of
 emperour; whole power people him. like
 these, proclamations kings england.
 
2. decrees whole people rome (comprehending senate,)
 put question senate. lawes, at
 first, vertue soveraign power residing people; and
 emperours abrogated, remained lawes by
 authority imperiall. lawes bind, understood be
 lawes authority power repeale them. somewhat like to
 lawes, acts parliament england.
 
3. decrees common people (excluding senate,) they
 put question tribune people. them
 abrogated emperours, remained lawes authority
 imperiall. like these, orders house commons in
 england.
 
4. senatus consulta, orders senate; people
 rome grew numerous, inconvenient assemble them; it
 thought fit emperour, men consult senate in
 stead people: resemblance acts of
 counsell.
 
5. edicts praetors, (in cases) aediles: as
 chiefe justices courts england.
 
6. responsa prudentum; sentences, opinions those
 lawyers, emperour gave authority interpret law, and
 give answer matter law demanded advice;
 answers, judges giving judgement obliged the
 constitutions emperour observe; like reports
 cases judged, judges law england bound to
 observe them. judges common law england, not
 properly judges, juris consulti; judges, either
 lords, twelve men country, point law ask
 advice.
 
7. also, unwritten customes, (which nature imitation
 law,) tacite consent emperour, case not
 contrary law nature, lawes.
 
another division lawes, naturall positive. naturall are
 lawes eternity; called onely
 naturall, also morall lawes; consisting morall vertues, as
 justice, equity, habits mind conduce peace, and
 charity; already spoken fourteenth fifteenth
 chapters.
 
positive, eternity; been
 made lawes will soveraign power over
 others; either written, made known men, other
 argument will legislator.
 



another division law
 
again, positive lawes humane, divine; humane
 positive lawes, distributive, penal. distributive are
 determine rights subjects, declaring every man
 is, acquireth holdeth propriety lands,
 goods, right liberty action; speak all
 subjects. penal those, declare, penalty shall be
 inflicted violate law; speak ministers
 officers ordained execution. though every one be
 informed punishments ordained beforehand transgression;
 neverthelesse command addressed delinquent, (who
 supposed will faithfully punish himselfe,) publique
 ministers appointed see penalty executed. penal lawes
 part written together lawes distributive; and
 sometimes called judgements. lawes generall judgements,
 sentences legislator; also every particular judgement, a
 law him, whose case judged.
 



divine positive law made known law
 
divine positive lawes (for naturall lawes eternall, and
 universall, divine,) those, commandements of
 god, (not eternity, universally addressed men, but
 onely certain people, certain persons,) declared for
 such, god hath authorised declare them. this
 authority man declare positive lawes god, can
 known? god may command man supernaturall way, deliver
 lawes men. essence law, who
 obliged, assured authority declareth
 it, naturally take notice god, can man
 without supernaturall revelation assured revelation received
 declarer? can bound obey them? first
 question, man can assured revelation another, without
 revelation particularly himselfe, evidently impossible:
 though man may induced believe revelation, the
 miracles see doe, seeing extraordinary sanctity of
 life, seeing extraordinary wisedome, extraordinary
 felicity actions, marks gods extraordinary
 favour; yet assured evidence speciall revelation.
 miracles marvellous workes: marvellous one,
 may another. sanctity may feigned; visible
 felicities world, often work god naturall,
 ordinary causes. therefore man can infallibly know by
 naturall reason, another supernaturall revelation gods
 will; beliefe; every one (as signs thereof shall appear
 greater, lesser) firmer, weaker belief.
 
second, can bound obey them; hard.
 law declared, law nature (which is
 undoubtedly gods law) undertake obey it, bound his
 act; bound say obey it, bound believe it: mens
 beliefe, interiour cogitations, subject commands,
 operation god, ordinary, extraordinary. faith of
 supernaturall law, fulfilling, assenting the
 same; duty exhibite god, gift god
 freely giveth pleaseth; also unbelief breach
 lawes; rejection all, except lawes
 naturall. say, will made yet cleerer, the
 examples, testimonies concerning point holy scripture. the
 covenant god made abraham (in supernaturall manner) thus,
 (gen. 17. 10) "this covenant thou shalt observe between
 thee thy seed thee." abrahams seed this
 revelation, yet being; yet party covenant,
 bound obey abraham declare gods law;
 be, vertue obedience owed to
 parents; (if subject earthly power, as
 case abraham) soveraign power children,
 servants. againe, god saith abraham, "in thee shall all
 nations earth blessed: know thou wilt command thy
 children, thy house thee keep way lord, to
 observe righteousnesse judgement," manifest, obedience of
 family, revelation, depended former obligation
 obey soveraign. mount sinai moses went god; the
 people forbidden approach paine death; yet bound
 obey moses declared gods law. upon ground,
 submission own, "speak thou us, will
 heare thee; let god speak us, lest dye?" two
 places sufficiently appeareth, common-wealth, subject
 certain assured revelation particularly himself
 concerning will god, obey such, command of
 common-wealth: men liberty, take gods
 commandements, dreams, fancies, dreams and
 fancies private men; scarce two men agree upon gods
 commandement; yet respect them, every man despise the
 commandements common-wealth. conclude therefore, all
 things contrary morall law, (that say, law of
 nature,) subjects bound obey divine law, is
 declared so, lawes common-wealth. also is
 evident mans reason; whatsoever law of
 nature, may made law name soveraign
 power; reason men lesse obliged it,
 tis propounded name god. besides, place in
 world men permitted pretend commandements god,
 declared common-wealth. christian states punish
 revolt christian religion, states, those
 set religion forbidden. whatsoever not
 regulated common-wealth, tis equity (which law nature,
 therefore eternall law god) every man equally enjoy his
 liberty.
 



another division lawes
 
also another distinction laws, fundamentall, not
 fundamentall: never see author, fundamentall
 law signifieth. neverthelesse one may reasonably distinguish laws
 manner.
 



fundamentall law what
 
fundamentall law every common-wealth that, taken
 away, common-wealth faileth, utterly dissolved; building
 whose foundation destroyed. therefore fundamentall law that,
 subjects bound uphold whatsoever power given the
 soveraign, whether monarch, soveraign assembly, without the
 common-wealth stand, power war peace, of
 judicature, election officers, whatsoever shall
 think necessary publique good. fundamentall that
 abrogating whereof, draweth dissolution the
 common-wealth; lawes concerning controversies between
 subject subject. thus much division lawes.
 



difference law right
 
find words lex civilis, jus civile, say, law and
 right civil, promiscuously used thing, even most
 learned authors; neverthelesse so. right is
 liberty, namely liberty civil law leaves us: civill
 law obligation; takes us liberty law of
 nature gave us. nature gave right every man secure himselfe
 strength, invade suspected neighbour, way of
 prevention; civill law takes away liberty, cases
 protection lawe may safely stayd for. insomuch as
 lex jus, different obligation liberty.
 



law charter
 
likewise lawes charters taken promiscuously same
 thing. yet charters donations soveraign; lawes, but
 exemptions law. phrase law jubeo, injungo, command,
 enjoyn: phrase charter dedi, concessi, given, i
 granted: given granted, man, forced
 upon him, law. law may made bind subjects a
 common-wealth: liberty, charter one man, one
 part people. say people common-wealth, have
 liberty case whatsoever; say, case, hath
 law made; else made, now abrogated.
 


chapter xxvii. crimes, excuses, extenuations
 


sinne what
 
sinne, onely transgression law, also contempt of
 legislator. contempt, breach lawes once.
 therefore may consist, onely commission fact, in
 speaking words lawes forbidden, omission of
 law commandeth, also intention, purpose to
 transgresse. purpose breake law, degree of
 contempt him, belongeth see executed. be
 delighted imagination onely, possessed another mans
 goods, servants, wife, without intention take him
 force, fraud, breach law, sayth, "thou shalt not
 covet:" pleasure man imagining, dreaming of
 death him, whose life expecteth nothing dammage, and
 displeasure, sinne; resolving put act execution,
 tendeth thereto. pleased fiction that, which
 please man reall, passion adhaerent the
 nature man, every living creature, make a
 sinne, make sinne man. consideration this,
 made think severe, themselves, others, that
 maintain, first motions mind, (though checked the
 fear god) sinnes. confesse safer erre hand,
 other.
 



crime what
 
crime, sinne, consisting committing (by deed, word)
 law forbiddeth, omission hath
 commanded. every crime sinne; every sinne crime.
 intend steale, kill, sinne, though never appeare in
 word, fact: god seeth thoughts man, can lay to
 charge: till appear thing done, said, which
 intention may crime; distinction greeks observed in
 word amartema, egklema, aitia; wherof former, (which is
 translated sinne,) signifieth swarving law whatsoever; but
 two later, (which translated crime,) signifie sinne onely,
 whereof one man may accuse another. intentions, never
 appear outward act, place humane accusation. in
 like manner latines peccatum, sinne, signifie manner
 deviation law; crimen, (which word derive from
 cerno, signifies perceive,) mean onely sinnes, my
 made appear judge; therfore meer intentions.
 



civill law is, crime
 
relation sinne law, crime civill
 law, may inferred, first, law ceaseth, sinne ceaseth.
 law nature eternall, violation covenants,
 ingratitude, arrogance, facts contrary morall vertue, can
 never cease sinne. secondly, civill law ceasing, crimes
 cease: law remaining, nature, there
 place accusation; every man judge, accused
 onely conscience, cleared uprightnesse own
 intention. therefore intention right, fact sinne:
 otherwise, fact sinne; crime. thirdly, the
 soveraign power ceaseth, crime also ceaseth: such
 power, protection law; therefore
 every one may protect power: man the
 institution soveraign power can supposed give away right
 preserving body; safety whereof soveraignty was
 ordained. understood onely those, not
 contributed taking away power protected
 them: crime beginning.
 



ignorance law nature excuseth man
 
source every crime, defect understanding; some
 errour reasoning, sudden force passions. defect in
 understanding, ignorance; reasoning, erroneous opinion. again,
 ignorance three sort; law, soveraign, the
 penalty. ignorance law nature excuseth man; every
 man hath attained use reason, supposed know, he
 another, done himselfe.
 therefore place soever man shall come, thing
 contrary law, crime. man come indies
 hither, perswade men receive new religion, teach them
 thing tendeth disobedience lawes country,
 though never well perswaded truth teacheth,
 commits crime, may justly punished same, onely
 doctrine false, also he
 approve another, namely, comming hence, should
 endeavour alter religion there. ignorance civill law,
 shall excuse man strange country, till declared him;
 because, till civill law binding.
 



ignorance civill law excuseth sometimes
 
like manner, civill law mans country, not
 sufficiently declared, may know will; action
 law nature; ignorance good excuse: other
 cases ignorance civill law, excuseth not.
 



ignorance soveraign excuseth not
 
ignorance soveraign power, place mans ordinary
 residence, excuseth not; take notice the
 power, hath protected there.
 



ignorance penalty excuseth not
 
ignorance penalty, law declared, excuseth man:
 breaking law, without fear penalty follow, were
 law, vain words, undergoeth penalty, though know not
 is; because, whosoever voluntarily doth action, accepteth
 known consequences it; punishment known consequence
 violation lawes, every common-wealth; punishment,
 determined already law, subject that; not,
 subject arbitrary punishment. reason, he
 injury, without limitation will,
 suffer punishment without limitation, will
 whose law thereby violated.
 



punishments declared fact, excuse greater punishments
 it
 
penalty, either annexed crime law selfe,
 hath usually inflicted like cases; delinquent
 excused greater penalty. punishment foreknown, not
 great enough deterre men action, invitement it:
 men compare benefit injustice, harm
 punishment, necessity nature choose which
 appeareth best themselves; therefore punished more
 law formerly determined, others punished
 crime; law tempted, deceiveth them.
 



nothing can made crime law made fact
 
law, made fact done, can make crime: the
 fact law nature, law fact; a
 positive law taken notice of, made; therefore
 obligatory. law forbiddeth fact, made
 fact done; yet doth fact, lyable the
 penalty ordained after, case lesser penalty made known
 before, neither writing, example, reason immediatly
 alledged.
 



false principles right wrong causes crime
 
defect reasoning, (that say, errour,) men prone
 violate lawes, three wayes. first, presumption false
 principles; men observed places, and
 ages, unjust actions authorised, force, and
 victories committed them; potent men,
 breaking cob-web lawes country, weaker sort,
 failed enterprises, esteemed the
 onely criminals; thereupon taken principles, grounds of
 reasoning, "that justice vain word: whatsoever man
 can get industry, hazard, own: practice
 nations unjust: examples former times good
 arguments like again;" many kind: which
 granted, act selfe can crime, must made so
 (not law, but) successe commit it; the
 fact vertuous, vicious, fortune pleaseth; what
 marius makes crime, sylla shall make meritorious, caesar (the same
 lawes standing) turn crime, perpetuall disturbance
 peace common-wealth.
 



false teachers mis-interpreting law nature secondly, false
 teachers, either mis-interpret law nature, making thereby
 repugnant law civill; teaching lawes, doctrines of
 own, traditions former times, inconsistent the
 duty subject.
 



false inferences true principles, teachers
 
thirdly, erroneous inferences true principles; happens
 commonly men hasty, praecipitate concluding, and
 resolving do; they, great opinion
 understanding, believe things nature
 require time study, onely common experience, good
 naturall wit; whereof man thinks himselfe unprovided: whereas the
 knowledge, right wrong, lesse difficult, no
 man will pretend to, without great long study. defects
 reasoning, none can excuse (though may
 extenuate) crime, man, pretendeth administration of
 private businesse; much lesse undertake publique
 charge; pretend reason, upon want whereof they
 ground excuse.
 



passions;
 
passions frequently causes crime, one,
 vain-glory, foolish over-rating worth; if
 difference worth, effect wit, riches, bloud,
 naturall quality, depending will that
 soveraign authority. whence proceedeth presumption that
 punishments ordained lawes, extended generally all
 subjects, inflicted them, rigour they
 inflicted poore, obscure, simple men, comprehended the
 name vulgar.
 



presumption riches
 
therefore happeneth commonly, value the
 greatnesse wealth, adventure crimes, upon hope escaping
 punishment, corrupting publique justice, obtaining pardon mony,
 rewards.
 



friends
 
multitude potent kindred; popular men, that
 gained reputation amongst multitude, take courage violate
 lawes, hope oppressing power, belongeth to
 put execution.
 



wisedome
 
great, false opinion wisedome,
 take upon reprehend actions, call question the
 authority govern, unsettle lawes their
 publique discourse, nothing shall crime, own
 designes require so. happeneth also men, be
 prone crimes, consist craft, deceiving their
 neighbours; think designes subtile be
 perceived. say effects false presumption own
 wisdome. first movers disturbance of
 common-wealth, (which can never happen without civill warre,) few
 left alive long enough, see new designes established: so
 benefit crimes, redoundeth posterity, as
 least wished it: argues wise, as
 thought were. deceive upon hope being
 observed, commonly deceive themselves, (the darknesse they
 believe lye hidden, nothing else blindnesse;)
 wiser children, think hid, hiding own
 eyes.
 
generally vain-glorious men, (unlesse withall timorous,)
 subject anger; prone others interpret for
 contempt, ordinary liberty conversation: crimes
 may produced anger.
 



hatred, lust, ambition, covetousnesse, causes crime
 
passions, hate, lust, ambition, covetousnesse, what
 crimes apt produce, obvious every mans experience
 understanding, needeth nothing said them, saving
 infirmities, annexed nature, man, and
 living creatures, effects hindred,
 extraordinary use reason, constant severity punishing
 them. things men hate, find continuall, and
 unavoydable molestation; whereby either mans patience must be
 everlasting, must eased removing power which
 molesteth him; former difficult; later many times
 impossible, without violation law. ambition, and
 covetousnesse passions also perpetually incumbent, and
 pressing; whereas reason perpetually present, resist them:
 therefore whensoever hope impunity appears, effects
 proceed. lust, wants lasting, hath the
 vehemence, sufficeth weigh apprehension easie,
 uncertain punishments.
 



fear sometimes cause crime, danger neither present,
 corporeall
 
passions, enclineth men least break lawes, is
 fear. nay, (excepting generous natures,) onely thing,
 (when apparence profit, pleasure breaking lawes,)
 makes men keep them. yet many cases crime may committed
 feare.
 
every fear justifies action produceth, fear onely
 corporeall hurt, call bodily fear, man
 see delivered, action. man assaulted,
 fears present death, sees escape, by
 wounding assaulteth him; wound death, no
 crime; man supposed making common-wealth, to
 abandoned defence life, limbes, law cannot
 arrive time enough assistance. kill man, from
 actions, threatnings, may argue will kill he
 can, (seeing time, means demand protection, the
 soveraign power,) crime. again, man receives words disgrace,
 little injuries (for made lawes, had
 assigned punishment, thought worthy man hath use
 reason, take notice of,) afraid, unlesse revenge it,
 shall fall contempt, consequently obnoxious like
 injuries others; avoyd this, breaks law, protects
 himselfe future, terrour private revenge. is
 crime; hurt corporeall, phantasticall, (though
 corner world, made sensible custome many years
 since begun, amongst young vain men,) light, gallant man,
 one assured courage, take notice of. also
 man may stand fear spirits, either superstition,
 much credit given men, tell strange
 dreams visions; thereby made believe will hurt him, for
 doing, omitting divers things, neverthelesse, do, omit,
 contrary lawes; done, omitted, not
 excused fear; crime. (as shewn before
 second chapter) dreams naturally fancies remaining in
 sleep, impressions senses formerly received waking;
 men accident unassured slept, seem be
 reall visions; therefore presumes break law upon his
 own, anothers dream, pretended vision, upon fancy of
 power invisible spirits, permitted common-wealth,
 leaveth law nature, certain offence, followeth the
 imagery own, another private mans brain, can never
 know whether signifieth thing, nothing, whether that
 tells dream, say true, lye; every private man should
 leave do, (as must law nature, one have
 it) law made hold, common-wealth would
 dissolved.
 



crimes equall
 
different sources crimes, appeares already, all
 crimes (as stoicks old time maintained) same
 allay. place, excuse, seemed
 crime, proved none all; also extenuation, which
 crime, seemed great, made lesse. though crimes doe
 equally deserve name injustice, deviation strait
 line equally crookednesse, stoicks rightly observed; yet
 follow crimes equally unjust, that
 crooked lines equally crooked; stoicks observing,
 held great crime, kill hen, law, kill
 ones father.
 



totall excuses
 
totally excuseth fact, takes away nature of
 crime, can none that, time, taketh away the
 obligation law. fact committed law,
 committed obliged law, can a
 crime.
 
want means know law, totally excuseth: law whereof
 man means enforme himself, obligatory. want
 diligence enquire, shall considered want means; nor
 shall man, pretendeth reason enough government of
 affairs, supposed want means know lawes nature;
 known reason pretends to: children, and
 madmen excused offences law naturall.
 
man captive, power enemy, (and in
 power enemy, person, means living, is
 so,) without fault, obligation law ceaseth;
 must obey enemy, dye; consequently obedience
 crime: man obliged (when protection law
 faileth,) protect himself, best means can.
 
man terrour present death, compelled doe fact
 law, totally excused; law can oblige a
 man abandon preservation. supposing law were
 obligatory; yet man reason thus, "if doe not, die
 presently; doe it, die afterwards; therefore it, there
 time life gained;" nature therefore compells fact.
 
man destitute food, thing necessary life,
 preserve himselfe way, fact against
 law; great famine take food force, stealth,
 obtaine mony charity; defence life,
 snatch away another mans sword, totally excused, reason
 next alledged.
 



excuses author
 
again, facts done law, authority another, are
 authority excused author; man to
 accuse fact another, instrument: it
 excused third person thereby injured; the
 violation law, bothe author, actor criminalls.
 hence followeth man, assembly, hath the
 soveraign power, commandeth man contrary a
 former law, totally excused: to
 condemn himselfe, author; justly
 condemned soveraign, justly punished other.
 besides, soveraign commandeth thing done against
 former law, command, particular fact, an
 abrogation law.
 
man, assembly, hath soveraign power, disclaime
 right essentiall soveraignty, whereby accrueth the
 subject, liberty inconsistent soveraign power, to
 say, common-wealth, subject shall refuse
 obey command thing, contrary liberty granted, this
 neverthelesse sinne, contrary duty subject: for
 take notice inconsistent soveraignty,
 erected consent, defence;
 liberty inconsistent it, granted through
 ignorance evill consequence thereof. onely disobey,
 also resist publique minister execution it, is
 crime; might righted, (without breach the
 peace,) upon complaint.
 
degrees crime taken divers scales, measured, first, by
 malignity source, cause: secondly, contagion the
 example: thirdly, mischiefe effect; fourthly, the
 concurrence times, places, persons.
 



presumption power, aggravateth
 
fact done law, proceed presumption of
 strength, riches, friends resist execute the
 law, greater crime, proceed hope being
 discovered, escape flight: presumption impunity by
 force, root, whence springeth, times, upon all
 temptations, contempt lawes; whereas later case, the
 apprehension danger, makes man fly, renders obedient
 future. crime know so, greater same
 crime proceeding false perswasion lawfull: that
 committeth conscience, presumeth force, or
 power, encourages commit again: that
 doth errour, errour shewn him, conformable the
 law.
 



evill teachers, extenuate
 
hee, whose errour proceeds authority teacher, an
 interpreter law publiquely authorised, faulty, he
 whose errour proceedeth peremptory pursute principles,
 reasoning: taught one teacheth publique
 authority, common-wealth teacheth, hath resemblance law,
 till authority controuleth it; crimes contain
 denyall soveraign power, evident
 law, excuseth totally: whereas groundeth actions, his
 private judgement, according rectitude, errour thereof,
 stand, fall.
 



examples impunity, extenuate
 
fact, constantly punished men, as
 greater crime, may precedent examples of
 impunity. examples, many hopes impunity given by
 soveraign himselfe: furnishes man such
 hope, presumption mercy, encourageth offend, hath his
 part offence; reasonably charge offender the
 whole.
 



praemeditation, aggravateth
 
crime arising sudden passion, great, same
 ariseth long meditation: former case place
 extenuation, common infirmity humane nature: that
 doth praemeditation, used circumspection, cast eye,
 law, punishment, consequence thereof humane
 society; committing crime, hee hath contemned, and
 postposed appetite. suddennesse passion
 sufficient totall excuse: time first
 knowing law, commission fact, shall taken for
 time deliberation; meditation law, to
 rectifie irregularity passions.
 
law publiquely, assiduity, people
 read, interpreted; fact done it, greater crime,
 men left without instruction, enquire with
 difficulty, uncertainty, interruption callings, and
 informed private men: case, part fault is
 discharged upon common infirmity; former apparent
 negligence, without contempt soveraign power.
 



tacite approbation soveraign, extenuates
 
facts law expresly condemneth, law-maker by
 manifest signes will tacitly approveth, lesse crimes,
 facts, condemned law, lawmaker. for
 seeing will law-maker law, appear case two
 contradictory lawes; totally excuse, men bound to
 take notice soveraigns approbation, arguments, are
 expressed command. punishments consequent,
 onely transgression law, also observing
 it, part cause transgression, therefore cannot
 reasonably impute whole crime delinquent. example, the
 law condemneth duells; punishment made capitall: contrary
 part, refuseth duell, subject contempt scorne, without
 remedy; sometimes soveraign himselfe thought unworthy to
 charge, preferment warre: thereupon accept duell,
 considering men lawfully endeavour obtain good opinion
 soveraign power, reason be
 rigorously punished; seeing part fault may discharged the
 punisher; say, wishing liberty private revenges,
 kind disobedience; care governours, not
 countenance thing obliquely, directly forbid. the
 examples princes, see them, are, ever been,
 potent govern actions, lawes themselves. and
 though duty do, do, say; yet
 will duty never performed, till please god give men an
 extraordinary, supernaturall grace follow precept.
 



comparison crimes effects
 
again, compare crimes mischiefe effects, first,
 fact, redounds dammage many, greater, than
 redounds hurt few. therefore, fact hurteth,
 onely present, also, (by example) future, a
 greater crime, hurt onely present: former,
 fertile crime, multiplyes hurt many; later is
 barren. maintain doctrines contrary religion established in
 common-wealth, greater fault, authorised preacher, than
 private person: also it, live prophanely, incontinently,
 irreligious act whatsoever. likewise professor the
 law, maintain point, act, tendeth weakning
 soveraign power, greater crime, another man: also in
 man hath reputation wisedome, counsells are
 followed, actions imitated many, fact law, is
 greater crime, fact another: men onely
 commit crime, teach law men. generally all
 crimes greater, scandall give; say, by
 becoming stumbling-blocks weak, look much upon the
 way go in, upon light men carry them.
 



laesae majestas
 
also facts hostility present state common-wealth,
 greater crimes, acts done private men; for
 dammage extends selfe all: betraying the
 strengths, revealing secrets common-wealth enemy;
 also attempts upon representative common-wealth, a
 monarch, assembly; endeavours word, deed diminish
 authority same, either present time, succession:
 crimes latines understand crimina laesae majestatis, and
 consist designe, act, contrary fundamentall law.
 



bribery false testimony
 
likewise crimes, render judgements effect, greater
 crimes, injuries done one, persons; receive
 mony give false judgement, testimony, greater crime, than
 otherwise deceive man like, greater summe; not
 onely wrong, falls judgements; judgements
 rendered uselesse, occasion ministred force, private
 revenges.
 



depeculation
 
also robbery, depeculation publique treasure, revenues,
 greater crime, robbing, defrauding private man;
 robbe publique, robbe many once.
 



counterfeiting authority
 
also counterfeit usurpation publique ministery, the
 counterfeiting publique seales, publique coine, than
 counterfeiting private mans person, seale; fraud
 thereof, extendeth dammage many.
 



crimes private men compared
 
facts law, done private men, greater crime, is
 that, dammage common opinion men, sensible.
 therefore
 
kill law, greater crime, injury, life
 preserved.
 
kill torment, greater, simply kill.
 
mutilation limbe, greater, spoyling man his
 goods.
 
spoyling man goods, terrour death, wounds,
 clandestine surreption.
 
clandestine surreption, consent fraudulently obtained.
 
violation chastity force, greater, flattery.
 
woman married, woman married.
 
things commonly valued; though men more,
 lesse sensible offence. law regardeth not
 particular, generall inclination mankind.
 
therefore offence men take, contumely, words, or
 gesture, produce harme, present griefe of
 reproached, hath neglected lawes greeks,
 romans, antient, moderne common-wealths; supposing
 true cause griefe consist, contumely, (which
 takes hold upon men conscious vertue,) the
 pusillanimity offended it.
 
also crime private man, much aggravated person,
 time, place. kill ones parent, greater crime, to
 kill another: parent honour soveraign,
 (though surrendred power civill law,) had
 originally nature. robbe poore man, greater crime,
 robbe rich man; ’tis poore sensible
 dammage.
 
crime committed time, place appointed devotion, is
 greater, committed another time place: proceeds
 greater contempt law.
 
many cases aggravation, extenuation might added: by
 set down, obvious every man, take altitude
 crime proposed.
 



publique crimes what
 
lastly, almost crimes injury done, onely
 private man, also common-wealth; crime, when
 accusation name common-wealth, called publique
 crime; name private man, private crime; the
 pleas according thereunto called publique, judicia publica, pleas the
 crown; private pleas. accusation murder, accuser
 private man, plea private plea; accuser the
 soveraign, plea publique plea.
 


chapter xxviii. punishments, rewards
 



definition punishment
 
"a punishment, evill inflicted publique authority, that
 hath done, omitted judged authority be
 transgression law; end will men may thereby
 better disposed obedience."
 



right punish whence derived
 
inferre thing definition, question to
 answered, much importance; is, door right, or
 authority punishing case, came in. has
 said before, man supposed bound covenant, resist
 violence; consequently intended, gave right
 another lay violent hands upon person. making a
 common-wealth, every man giveth away right defending another; but
 defending himselfe. also obligeth himselfe, assist that
 hath soveraignty, punishing another; himselfe
 not. covenant assist soveraign, hurt another,
 unlesse covenanteth right doe himselfe, not
 give right punish. manifest therefore right
 common-wealth (that is, he, represent it) hath to
 punish, grounded concession, gift subjects.
 also shewed formerly, institution of
 common-wealth, every man right every thing, do
 whatsoever thought necessary preservation; subduing,
 hurting, killing man order thereunto. the
 foundation right punishing, exercised every
 common-wealth. subjects give soveraign right;
 onely laying theirs, strengthned use own, he
 think fit, preservation all: not
 given, left him, onely; (excepting limits set
 naturall law) entire, condition meer nature, and
 warre every one neighbour.
 



private injuries, revenges punishments
 
definition punishment, inferre, first, neither
 private revenges, injuries private men, can properly stiled
 punishment; proceed publique authority.
 



denyall preferment
 
secondly, neglected, unpreferred publique
 favour, punishment; new evill thereby man
 inflicted; onely left estate before.
 



pain inflicted without publique hearing
 
thirdly, evill inflicted publique authority, without
 precedent publique condemnation, stiled name of
 punishment; hostile act; fact man
 punished, first judged publique authority, a
 transgression law.
 



pain inflicted usurped power
 
fourthly, evill inflicted usurped power, judges
 without authority soveraign, punishment; act of
 hostility; acts power usurped, author, the
 person condemned; therefore acts publique authority.
 



pain inflicted without respect future good
 
fifthly, evill inflicted without intention, or
 possibility disposing delinquent, (by example) men,
 obey lawes, punishment; act hostility; because
 without end, hurt done contained name.
 



naturall evill consequences, punishments
 
sixthly, whereas certain actions, annexed nature, divers
 hurtfull consequences; man assaulting another, himselfe
 slain, wounded; falleth sicknesse of
 unlawfull act; hurt, though respect god, the
 author nature, may said inflicted, therefore a
 punishment divine; yet contaned name punishment in
 respect men, inflicted authority man.
 



hurt inflicted, lesse benefit transgressing, not
 punishment
 
seventhly, harm inflicted lesse benefit, or
 contentment naturally followeth crime committed, harm is
 within definition; rather price, redemption, than
 punishment crime: nature punishment, to
 end, disposing men obey law; end (if it
 lesse benefit transgression) attaineth not, but
 worketh contrary effect.
 



punishment annexed law, greater hurt not
 punishment, hostility
 
eighthly, punishment determined prescribed law it
 selfe, crime committed, greater punishment
 inflicted, excesse punishment, act hostility. for
 seeing aym punishment revenge, terrour; the
 terrour great punishment unknown, taken away declaration
 lesse, unexpected addition part punishment.
 punishment determined law, there
 whatsoever inflicted, hath nature punishment. that
 goes violation law, wherein penalty determined,
 expecteth indeterminate, say, arbitrary punishment.
 



hurt inflicted fact done law, punishment
 
ninthly, harme inflicted fact done law that
 forbad it, punishment, act hostility: the
 law, transgression law: punishment supposeth a
 fact judged, transgression law; therefore
 harme inflicted law made, punishment, act of
 hostility.
 



representative common-wealth unpunishable
 
tenthly, hurt inflicted representative common-wealth, is
 punishment, act hostility: nature
 punishment, inflicted publique authority, the
 authority representative self.
 



hurt revolted subjects done right war, way of
 punishment
 
lastly, harme inflicted upon one declared enemy, fals not
 name punishment: seeing either never
 subject law, therefore transgresse it; been
 subject it, professing longer so, consequence deny
 can transgresse it, harmes can done them, must be
 taken acts hostility. declared hostility, infliction of
 evill lawfull. whence followeth, subject shall
 fact, word, wittingly, deliberatly deny authority of
 representative common-wealth, (whatsoever penalty hath
 formerly ordained treason,) may lawfully made suffer
 whatsoever representative will: denying subjection, denyes
 punishment law hath ordained; therefore suffers
 enemy common-wealth; is, according will of
 representative. punishments set law, to
 subjects, enemies; they, their
 act subjects, deliberately revolting, deny soveraign power.
 
first, generall distribution punishments, into
 divine, humane. former shall occasion, speak, a
 convenient place hereafter.
 
humane, punishments inflicted commandement
 man; either corporall, pecuniary, ignominy, or
 imprisonment, exile, mixt these.
 



punishments corporall
 
corporall punishment that, inflicted body directly,
 according intention inflicteth it: are
 stripes, wounds, deprivation pleasures body, as
 lawfully enjoyed.
 



capitall
 
these, capitall, lesse capitall. capitall, is
 infliction death; either simply, torment. lesse
 capitall, stripes, wounds, chains, corporall
 paine, nature mortall. upon infliction of
 punishment death follow intention inflicter, the
 punishment bee esteemed capitall, though harme prove
 mortall accident foreseen; case death not
 inflicted, hastened.
 
pecuniary punishment, consisteth the
 deprivation summe mony, also lands, goods
 usually bought sold mony. case law, that
 ordaineth punishment, made design gather mony, from
 shall transgresse same, properly punishment,
 price priviledge, exemption law, doth not
 absolutely forbid fact, able pay
 mony: except law naturall, part religion; in
 case exemption law, transgression of
 it. law exacteth pecuniary mulct, take the
 name god vaine, payment mulct, price a
 dispensation sweare, punishment transgression law
 undispensable. like manner law impose summe mony be
 payd, injured; satisfaction the
 hurt done him; extinguisheth accusation party injured,
 crime offender.
 



ignominy
 
ignominy, infliction evill, made dishonorable;
 deprivation good, made honourable the
 common-wealth. things honorable nature; the
 effects courage, magnanimity, strength, wisdome, abilities
 body mind: others made honorable common-wealth; badges,
 titles, offices, singular marke soveraigns favour.
 former, (though may faile nature, accident,) be
 taken away law; therefore losse punishment.
 later, may taken away publique authority made
 honorable, properly punishments: degrading men
 condemned, badges, titles, offices; declaring them
 uncapable like time come.
 



imprisonment
 
imprisonment, man publique authority deprived of
 liberty; may happen two divers ends; whereof one safe
 custody man accused; inflicting paine man
 condemned. former punishment; man supposed
 punisht, judicially heard, declared guilty.
 therefore whatsoever hurt man made suffer bonds, or
 restraint, cause heard, is
 necessary assure custody, law nature. the
 later punishment, evill, inflicted publique authority,
 somewhat authority judged transgression
 law. word imprisonment, comprehend restraint of
 motion, caused externall obstacle, house, called
 generall name prison; iland, men said to
 confined it; place men set worke, old time
 men condemned quarries, times gallies; or
 chaine, impediment.
 



exile
 
exile, (banishment) man crime, condemned depart
 dominion common-wealth, certaine part
 thereof; prefixed time, ever, return it:
 seemeth nature, without circumstances, be
 punishment; rather escape, publique commandement to
 avoid punishment flight. cicero sayes, never such
 punishment ordained city rome; cals refuge men in
 danger. man banished, neverthelesse permitted enjoy
 goods, revenue lands, meer change ayr no
 punishment; tend benefit common-wealth, for
 punishments ordained, (that say, forming of
 mens wils observation law;) many times dammage
 common-wealth. banished man, lawfull enemy the
 common-wealth banished him; member the
 same. withall deprived lands, goods, then
 punishment lyeth exile, reckoned amongst
 punishments pecuniary.
 



punishment innocent subjects contrary law nature
 
punishments innocent subjects, great little, are
 law nature; punishment transgression of
 law, therefore can punishment innocent. it
 therefore violation, first, law nature, forbiddeth
 men, revenges, look thing future good:
 can arrive good common-wealth, punishing the
 innocent. secondly, that, forbiddeth ingratitude: seeing
 soveraign power, originally given consent every one of
 subjects, end long obedient, be
 protected thereby; punishment innocent, rendring of
 evill good. thirdly, law commandeth equity; that
 say, equall distribution justice; punishing the
 innocent observed.
 



harme done innocents war, so
 
infliction evill soever, innocent man, not
 subject, benefit common-wealth, without
 violation former covenant, breach law nature.
 men subjects, either enemies, else have
 ceased so, precedent covenants. enemies,
 common-wealth judgeth capable hurt, lawfull by
 originall right nature make warre; wherein sword judgeth
 not, doth victor make distinction nocent innocent, to
 time past; respect mercy, conduceth to
 good people. upon ground is, also
 subjects, deliberatly deny authority common-wealth
 established, vengeance lawfully extended, onely the
 fathers, also third fourth generation yet being,
 consequently innocent fact, afflicted:
 nature offence, consisteth renouncing of
 subjection; relapse condition warre, commonly
 called rebellion; offend, suffer subjects, but
 enemies. rebellion, warre renewed.
 



reward, either salary, grace
 
reward, either gift, contract. contract, is
 called salary, wages; benefit due service performed, or
 promised. gift, benefit proceeding grace them
 bestow it, encourage, enable men service. and
 therefore soveraign common-wealth appointeth salary
 publique office, receiveth it, bound justice
 performe office; otherwise, bound onely honour, to
 acknowledgement, endeavour requitall. though men no
 lawfull remedy, commanded quit private businesse,
 serve publique, without reward, salary; yet not
 bound thereto, law nature, institution the
 common-wealth, unlesse service otherwise done; it
 supposed soveraign may make use means, insomuch as
 common souldier, may demand wages warrefare, a
 debt.
 



benefits bestowed fear, rewards
 
benefits soveraign bestoweth subject, fear some
 power, ability hath hurt common-wealth, not
 properly rewards; salaryes; this
 case contract supposed, every man obliged already the
 common-wealth disservice: graces; extorted
 feare, incident soveraign power: but
 rather sacrifices, soveraign (considered naturall
 person, person common-wealth) makes, the
 appeasing discontent thinks potent himselfe; and
 encourage obedience, contrary, continuance, and
 increasing extortion.
 



salaries certain casuall
 
whereas salaries certain, proceed publique
 treasure; others uncertain, casuall, proceeding the
 execution office salary ordained; later
 cases hurtfull common-wealth; case of
 judicature. benefit judges, ministers a
 court justice, ariseth multitude causes brought
 cognisance, must needs follow two inconveniences: one,
 nourishing sutes; sutes, greater benefit: and
 another depends that, contention jurisdiction;
 court drawing selfe, many causes can. in
 offices execution inconveniences; their
 employment encreased endeavour own. thus
 much shall suffice nature punishment, reward; are,
 were, nerves tendons, move limbes joynts a
 common-wealth.
 
hitherto set forth nature man, (whose pride other
 passions compelled submit himselfe government;) together
 great power governour, compared leviathan,
 taking comparison two last verses one and
 fortieth job; god set forth great power of
 leviathan, called king proud. "there nothing," saith he,
 "on earth, compared him. made afraid. hee
 seeth every high thing him; king children of
 pride." mortall, subject decay, other
 earthly creatures are; heaven, (though not
 earth) stand fear of, whose lawes to
 obey; shall next following chapters speak diseases, and
 causes mortality; lawes nature bound to
 obey.
 


chapter xxix. things weaken, tend dissolution of
 common-wealth
 

dissolution common-wealths proceedeth imperfect institution
 
though nothing can immortall, mortals make; yet, men the
 use reason pretend to, common-wealths might secured, at
 least, perishing internall diseases. nature their
 institution, designed live, long man-kind, as
 lawes nature, justice selfe, gives life.
 therefore come dissolved, externall violence, but
 intestine disorder, fault men, matter; but
 makers, orderers them. men, become
 last weary irregular justling, hewing one another, desire
 hearts, conforme one firme lasting
 edifice; want, art making fit laws, square
 actions by, also humility, patience, suffer rude
 combersome points present greatnesse taken off, they
 without help able architect, compiled, any
 crasie building, hardly lasting time,
 must assuredly fall upon heads posterity.
 
amongst infirmities therefore common-wealth, will reckon in
 first place, arise imperfect institution,
 resemble diseases naturall body, proceed a
 defectuous procreation.
 



want absolute power
 
which, one, "that man obtain kingdome, sometimes
 content lesse power, peace, defence the
 common-wealth necessarily required." whence commeth passe,
 exercise power layd by, publique safety
 resumed, hath resemblance unjust act; disposeth
 great numbers men (when occasion presented) rebell; the
 manner bodies children, gotten diseased parents, are
 subject either untimely death, purge ill quality, derived
 vicious conception, breaking biles scabbs.
 kings deny necessary power, not
 alwayes (though sometimes) ignorance necessary the
 office undertake; many times hope recover same
 pleasure: wherein reason well; as
 will hold promises, shall maintained by
 forraign common-wealths; order good subjects
 let slip occasions weaken estate neighbours. was
 thomas beckett archbishop canterbury, supported henry
 second, pope; subjection ecclesiastiques the
 common-wealth, dispensed william conqueror at
 reception, took oath, infringe liberty the
 church. barons, whose power william rufus (to
 help transferring succession elder brother,
 himselfe,) encreased degree, inconsistent soveraign
 power, maintained rebellion king john, french.
 happen monarchy onely. whereas stile the
 antient roman common-wealth, was, senate, people rome;
 neither senate, people pretended whole power; first
 caused seditions, tiberius gracchus, caius gracchus, lucius
 saturnius, others; afterwards warres senate and
 people, marius sylla; pompey caesar,
 extinction democraty, setting monarchy.
 
people athens bound one onely action; which
 was, man pain death propound renewing the
 warre island salamis; yet thereby, solon not
 caused given mad, afterwards gesture habit
 mad-man, verse, propounded people flocked
 him, enemy perpetually readinesse, even the
 gates citie; dammage, shifts, common-wealths
 forced to, power never little limited.
 



private judgement good evill
 
second place, observe diseases common-wealth, that
 proceed poyson seditious doctrines; whereof one is, "that
 every private man judge good evill actions." true in
 condition meer nature, civill lawes; also
 civill government, cases determined the
 law. otherwise, manifest, measure good evill
 actions, civill law; judge legislator, alwayes
 representative common-wealth. false doctrine, men are
 disposed debate themselves, dispute commands the
 common-wealth; afterwards obey, disobey them, their
 private judgements shall think fit. whereby common-wealth is
 distracted weakened.
 



erroneous conscience
 
another doctrine repugnant civill society, is, "whatsoever a
 man conscience, sinne;" dependeth the
 presumption making judge good evill. mans
 conscience, judgement thing; judgement,
 also conscience may erroneous. therefore, though is
 subject civill law, sinneth conscience,
 rule follow reason; yet is
 lives common-wealth; law the
 publique conscience, hath already undertaken guided.
 otherwise diversity, private consciences, which
 private opinions, common-wealth must needs distracted,
 man dare obey soveraign power, farther shall seem
 good eyes.
 



pretence inspiration
 
hath also commonly taught, "that faith sanctity, to
 attained study reason, supernaturall inspiration, or
 infusion," granted, see man render reason
 faith; every christian also prophet; or
 man take law country, rather own
 inspiration, rule action. thus wee fall into
 fault taking upon us judge good evill; make
 judges it, private men pretend supernaturally inspired,
 dissolution civill government. faith comes hearing,
 hearing accidents, guide us presence them
 speak us; accidents contrived god almighty; and
 yet supernaturall, onely, great number that
 concurre every effect, unobservable. faith, sanctity, indeed
 frequent; yet miracles, brought passe
 education, discipline, correction, naturall wayes, which
 god worketh elect, time thinketh fit. and
 three opinions, pernicious peace government, this
 part world, proceeded chiefly tongues, pens of
 unlearned divines; joyning words holy scripture together,
 otherwise agreeable reason, can, make men
 think, sanctity naturall reason, stand together.
 



subjecting soveraign power civill lawes
 
fourth opinion, repugnant nature common-wealth, this,
 "that hath soveraign power, subject civill lawes."
 true, soveraigns subjects lawes nature;
 lawes divine, man, common-wealth
 abrogated. lawes soveraign himselfe, is,
 common-wealth maketh, subject. subject to
 lawes, subject common-wealth, soveraign
 representative, himselfe; subjection, but
 freedome lawes. errour, setteth lawes
 soveraign, setteth also judge him, power to
 punish him; make new soveraign; same
 reason third, punish second; continually without end, to
 confusion, dissolution common-wealth.
 



attributing absolute propriety subjects
 
fifth doctrine, tendeth dissolution common-wealth,
 is, "that every private man absolute propriety goods;
 such, excludeth right soveraign." every man indeed a
 propriety excludes right every subject: it
 onely soveraign power; without protection whereof, every
 man equall right same. right the
 soveraign also excluded, performe office put
 into; is, defend forraign enemies, and
 injuries one another; consequently longer a
 common-wealth.
 
propriety subjects, exclude right the
 soveraign representative goods; much lesse offices
 judicature, execution, represent soveraign
 himselfe.
 



dividing soveraign power
 
sixth doctrine, plainly, directly essence
 common-wealth; ’tis this, "that soveraign power may be
 divided." divide power common-wealth, but
 dissolve it; powers divided mutually destroy other. for
 doctrines, men chiefly beholding those, making
 profession lawes, endeavour make depend upon own
 learning, upon legislative power.
 



imitation neighbour nations
 
false doctrine, also often-times example different
 government neighbouring nation, disposeth men alteration of
 forme already setled. people jewes stirred to
 reject god, call upon prophet samuel, king after
 manner nations; also lesser cities greece, were
 continually disturbed, seditions aristocraticall, and
 democraticall factions; one part almost every common-wealth, desiring
 imitate lacedaemonians; other, athenians. doubt
 not, many men, contented see late troubles in
 england, imitation low countries; supposing there
 needed grow rich, change, done, forme
 government. constitution mans nature, selfe
 subject desire novelty: therefore provoked same,
 neighbourhood also enriched it, is
 almost impossible them, content solicite
 change; love first beginnings, though grieved
 continuance disorder; like hot blouds, gotten
 itch, tear nayles, till can endure
 smart longer.
 



imitation greeks, romans
 
rebellion particular monarchy; one most
 frequent causes it, reading books policy, and
 histories antient greeks, romans; which, young men,
 others unprovided antidote solid reason,
 receiving strong, delightfull impression, great exploits
 warre, atchieved conductors armies, receive withall
 pleasing idea, done besides; imagine great
 prosperity, proceeded aemulation particular men,
 vertue popular form government: considering
 frequent seditions, civill warres, produced imperfection
 policy. reading, say, books, men have
 undertaken kill kings, greek latine writers,
 books, discourses policy, make lawfull, laudable,
 man do; provided it, call tyrant. for
 say regicide, is, killing king, tyrannicide, that
 is, killing tyrant lawfull. books, live
 monarch conceive opinion, subjects popular
 common-wealth enjoy liberty; monarchy slaves.
 say, live monarchy conceive opinion; not
 live popular government; find matter.
 summe, imagine, anything can prejudiciall a
 monarchy, allowing books publikely read, without
 present applying correctives discreet masters, fit to
 take away venime; venime will doubt compare to
 biting mad dogge, disease physicians call
 hydrophobia, fear water. bitten, a
 continuall torment thirst, yet abhorreth water; such
 estate, poyson endeavoured convert dogge:
 monarchy bitten quick, democraticall
 writers, continually snarle estate; wanteth nothing
 strong monarch, neverthelesse certain
 tyrannophobia, feare strongly governed, him,
 abhorre.
 
doctors, hold three soules man;
 also think may soules, (that is, more
 soveraigns,) one, common-wealth; set supremacy
 soveraignty; canons lawes; ghostly authority
 civill; working mens minds, words distinctions,
 signifie nothing, bewray (by obscurity)
 walketh (as think invisibly) another kingdome, it
 kingdome fayries, dark. now seeing manifest, that
 civill power, power common-wealth same
 thing; supremacy, power making canons, granting
 faculties, implyeth common-wealth; followeth, one is
 soveraign, another supreme; one can make lawes, another
 make canons; must needs two common-wealths, one & same
 subjects; kingdome divided selfe, stand. for
 notwithstanding insignificant distinction temporall, ghostly,
 still two kingdomes, every subject subject two
 masters. seeing ghostly power challengeth right declare
 sinne challengeth consequence declare law,
 (sinne nothing transgression law;) again, the
 civill power challenging declare law, every subject must
 obey two masters, bothe will commands observed law;
 impossible. or, one kingdome, either civill,
 power common-wealth, must subordinate the
 ghostly; ghostly must subordinate temporall then
 supremacy temporall. therefore two powers
 oppose one another, common-wealth great danger
 civill warre, dissolution. civill authority more
 visible, standing cleerer light naturall reason cannot
 choose draw times considerable part the
 people: spirituall, though stand darknesse schoole
 distinctions, hard words; yet fear darknesse, and
 ghosts, greater fears, want party sufficient to
 trouble, sometimes destroy common-wealth. disease
 unfitly may compared epilepsie, falling-sicknesse
 (which jewes took one kind possession spirits) the
 body naturall. disease, unnaturall spirit,
 wind head obstructeth roots nerves, moving
 violently, taketh away motion naturally have
 power soule brain, thereby causeth violent,
 irregular motions (which men call convulsions) parts;
 insomuch seized therewith, falleth sometimes the
 water, sometimes fire, man deprived senses;
 also body politique, spirituall power, moveth the
 members common-wealth, terrour punishments, hope of
 rewards (which nerves it,) otherwise civill power
 (which soule common-wealth) moved; by
 strange, hard words suffocates people, either overwhelm
 common-wealth oppression, cast fire civill
 warre.
 



mixt government
 
sometimes also meerly civill government, than
 one soule: power levying mony, (which nutritive
 faculty,) depended generall assembly; power conduct and
 command, (which motive faculty,) one man; power of
 making lawes, (which rationall faculty,) accidentall
 consent, onely two, also third; endangereth
 common-wealth, somtimes want consent good lawes; most
 often want nourishment, necessary life, motion.
 although perceive, government, government,
 division common-wealth three factions, call it
 mixt monarchy; yet truth is, one independent
 common-wealth, three independent factions; one representative
 person, three. kingdome god, may three persons
 independent, without breach unity god reigneth; men
 reigne, subject diversity opinions, so. and
 therefore king bear person people, generall
 assembly bear also person people, another assembly bear
 person part people, one person, one
 soveraign, three persons, three soveraigns.
 
disease naturall body man, may exactly compare this
 irregularity common-wealth, know not. seen man, that
 another man growing side, head, armes, breast,
 stomach, own: another man growing his
 side, comparison might exact.
 



want mony
 
hitherto named diseases common-wealth, the
 greatest, present danger. other, great; which
 neverthelesse unfit observed. first, difficulty of
 raising mony, necessary uses common-wealth; especially
 approach warre. difficulty ariseth opinion, that
 every subject hath propriety lands goods, exclusive of
 soveraigns right use same. whence commeth to
 passe, soveraign power, foreseeth necessities and
 dangers common-wealth, (finding passage mony the
 publique treasure obstructed, tenacity people,) whereas
 extend selfe, encounter, prevent dangers in
 beginnings, contracteth selfe long can, it
 longer, struggles people strategems law, obtain
 little summes, sufficing, fain last violently to
 open way present supply, perish; put often these
 extremities, last reduceth people due temper; else
 common-wealth must perish. insomuch may compare distemper
 aptly ague; wherein, fleshy parts congealed, or
 venomous matter obstructed; veins naturall course
 empty heart, (as be) supplyed
 arteries, whereby succeedeth first cold contraction,
 trembling limbes; afterwards hot, strong endeavour
 heart, force passage bloud; can do
 that, contenteth selfe small refreshments things as
 coole time, till (if nature strong enough) break last
 contumacy parts obstructed, dissipateth venome into
 sweat; (if nature weak) patient dyeth.
 



monopolies abuses publicans
 
again, sometimes common-wealth, disease, which
 resembleth pleurisie; is, treasure the
 common-wealth, flowing due course, gathered together in
 much abundance, one, private men, monopolies, by
 farmes publique revenues; manner blood a
 pleurisie, getting membrane breast, breedeth an
 inflammation, accompanied fever, painfull stitches.
 



popular men
 
also, popularity potent subject, (unlesse common-wealth
 good caution fidelity,) dangerous disease; because
 people (which receive motion authority the
 soveraign,) flattery, reputation ambitious man,
 drawn away obedience lawes, follow man, of
 whose vertues, designes knowledge. commonly
 danger popular government, monarchy; may
 easily made believe, people. means was, that
 julius caesar, set people senate, having
 won himselfe affections army, made himselfe master, both
 senate people. proceeding popular, ambitious men,
 plain rebellion; may resembled effects witchcraft.
 



excessive greatnesse town, multitude corporations
 
another infirmity common-wealth, immoderate greatnesse a
 town, able furnish circuit, number, and
 expence great army: also great number corporations; which
 many lesser common-wealths bowels greater,
 like wormes entrayles naturall man.
 



liberty disputing soveraign power
 
may added, liberty disputing absolute power,
 pretenders politicall prudence; though bred most
 part lees people; yet animated false doctrines, are
 perpetually medling fundamentall lawes, molestation
 common-wealth; like little wormes, physicians call
 ascarides.
 
may adde, insatiable appetite, bulimia, enlarging
 dominion; incurable wounds thereby many times received from
 enemy; wens, ununited conquests, many times a
 burthen, lesse danger lost, kept; also lethargy of
 ease, consumption riot vain expence.
 



dissolution common-wealth
 
lastly, warre (forraign, intestine,) enemies got a
 final victory; (the forces common-wealth keeping field
 longer) farther protection subjects loyalty;
 common-wealth dissolved, every man liberty protect
 himselfe courses discretion shall suggest unto him.
 soveraign, publique soule, giving life motion the
 common-wealth; expiring, members governed more,
 carcasse man, departed (though immortal) soule. for
 though right soveraign monarch extinguished the
 act another; yet obligation members may. that
 wants protection, may seek anywhere; hath it, obliged
 (without fraudulent pretence submitted himselfe fear,)
 protect protection long able. power of
 assembly suppressed, right perisheth utterly;
 assembly selfe extinct; consequently, no
 possibility soveraignty re-enter.
 


chapter xxx. office soveraign representative
 



procuration good people
 
office soveraign, (be monarch, assembly,)
 consisteth end, trusted soveraign
 power, namely procuration safety people; he
 obliged law nature, render account thereof to
 god, author law, none him. safety here, is
 meant bare preservation, also contentments life,
 every man lawfull industry, without danger, hurt the
 common-wealth, shall acquire himselfe.
 



instruction & lawes
 
intended done, care applyed to
 individualls, protection injuries, they
 shall complain; generall providence, contained publique
 instruction, doctrine, example; making, and
 executing good lawes, individuall persons may apply their
 cases.
 



duty soveraign relinquish essentiall right of
 soveraignty see people taught grounds them
 
because, essentiall rights soveraignty (specified before
 eighteenth chapter) taken away, common-wealth thereby
 dissolved, every man returneth condition, calamity a
 warre every man, (which greatest evill can happen
 life;) office soveraign, maintain those
 rights entire; consequently duty, first, transferre
 another, lay himselfe them. deserteth
 means, deserteth ends; deserteth means, being
 soveraign, acknowledgeth himselfe subject civill lawes; and
 renounceth power supreme judicature; making warre, or
 peace authority; judging necessities the
 common-wealth; levying mony, souldiers, when, much as
 conscience shall judge necessary; making officers,
 ministers warre, peace; appointing teachers, and
 examining doctrines conformable, contrary defence,
 peace, good people. secondly, duty, let
 people ignorant, mis-in-formed grounds, reasons
 essentiall rights; thereby men easie be
 seduced, drawn resist him, common-wealth shall require
 use exercise.
 
grounds rights, rather need diligently,
 truly taught; maintained civill law,
 terrour legal punishment. civill law, shall forbid
 rebellion, (and resistance essentiall rights of
 soveraignty,) (as civill law) obligation, vertue
 onely law nature, forbiddeth violation faith;
 naturall obligation men know not, know right of
 law soveraign maketh. punishment, take it
 act hostility; think strength
 enough, will endeavour acts hostility, avoyd.
 



objection say principles reason for
 absolute soveraignty
 
heard say, justice word, without substance;
 whatsoever man can force, art, acquire himselfe,
 (not onely condition warre, also common-wealth,) is
 own, already shewed false: also
 maintain, grounds, principles reason, to
 sustain essentiall rights, make soveraignty absolute. for
 were, found place, other;
 whereas see, hitherto common-wealth, where
 rights acknowledged, challenged. wherein argue
 ill, savage people america, deny any
 grounds, principles reason, build house, last as
 long materials, never yet saw well built.
 time, industry, produce every day new knowledge. art
 well building, derived principles reason, observed by
 industrious men, long studied nature materials, and
 divers effects figure, proportion, long mankind
 began (though poorly) build: so, long time men begun to
 constitute common-wealths, imperfect, apt relapse disorder,
 may, principles reason found out, industrious meditation,
 make use them, neglected them, not, concerneth my
 particular interest, day, little. supposing that
 mine principles reason; yet sure are
 principles authority scripture; shall make appear, when
 shall come speak kingdome god, (administred moses,)
 jewes, peculiar people covenant.
 



objection incapacity vulgar
 
say again, though principles right, yet common
 people capacity enough made understand them. i
 glad, rich, potent subjects kingdome, or
 accounted learned, lesse incapable than
 they. men know, obstructions kind doctrine,
 proceed much difficulty matter, the
 interest learn. potent men, digest hardly thing
 setteth power bridle affections; learned men,
 thing discovereth errours, thereby lesseneth their
 authority: whereas common-peoples minds, unlesse tainted
 dependance potent, scribbled opinions
 doctors, like clean paper, fit receive whatsoever by
 publique authority shall imprinted them. shall whole nations be
 brought acquiesce great mysteries christian religion, which
 reason; millions men made believe, same
 body may innumerable places, one time, which
 reason; shall men able, teaching, and
 preaching, protected law, make received, so
 consonant reason, unprejudicated man, needs learn
 it, hear it? conclude therefore, instruction
 people essentiall rights (which naturall, and
 fundamentall lawes) soveraignty, difficulty, (whilest a
 soveraign power entire,) proceeds fault,
 fault trusteth administration the
 common-wealth; consequently, duty, cause be
 instructed; onely duty, benefit also, security,
 danger may arrive himselfe naturall person,
 rebellion.
 



subjects taught, affect change government
 
(to descend particulars) people taught, first, that
 love forme government see
 neighbour nations, own, (whatsoever
 present prosperity behold nations otherwise governed
 they,) desire change. prosperity people ruled by
 aristocraticall, democraticall assembly, commeth from
 aristocracy, democracy, obedience, concord of
 subjects; people flourish monarchy, one man
 right rule them, obey him. take away in
 kind state, obedience, (and consequently concord the
 people,) shall onely flourish, short time be
 dissolved. go disobedience, doe than
 reforme common-wealth, shall find thereby destroy it; like
 foolish daughters peleus (in fable;) desiring renew
 youth decrepit father, counsell medea, cut
 pieces, boyle him, together strange herbs, made not
 new man. desire change, like breach first
 gods commandements: god says, non habebis deos alienos;
 thou shalt gods nations; another place
 concerning kings, gods.
 



adhere (against soveraign) popular men
 
secondly, taught, led with
 admiration vertue fellow subjects, how
 high soever stand, conspicuously soever shine the
 common-wealth; assembly, (except soveraign assembly,)
 deferre obedience, honour, appropriate the
 soveraign onely, (in particular stations) represent; nor
 receive influence them, conveighed them
 soveraign authority. soveraign, imagined to
 love people ought, jealous them, suffers
 flattery popular men, seduced loyalty,
 often been, onely secretly, openly, to
 proclaime marriage facie ecclesiae preachers; by
 publishing open streets: may fitly compared to
 violation second ten commandements.
 


dispute soveraign power
 
thirdly, consequence this, informed, great
 fault is, speak evill soveraign representative, (whether
 one man, assembly men;) argue dispute power, or
 way use name irreverently, whereby may brought into
 contempt people, obedience (in safety
 common-wealth consisteth) slackened. doctrine third
 commandement resemblance pointeth to.
 



dayes set apart learn duty
 
fourthly, seeing people taught this, ’tis taught,
 remember it, one generation past, much know the
 soveraign power placed, without setting part ordinary
 labour, certain times, may attend are

honour parents
 
first instruction children, dependeth care
 parents; necessary obedient them,
 whilest tuition; onely so, also
 afterwards (as gratitude requireth,) acknowledge benefit of
 education, externall signes honour. end are
 taught, originally father every man also his
 soveraign lord, power life death; the
 fathers families, instituting common-wealth, resigned
 absolute power, yet never intended, lose the
 honour due unto education. relinquish right,
 necessary institution soveraign power; there
 reason, man desire children, take the
 care nourish, instruct them, afterwards no
 benefit them, men. accordeth with

avoyd injury:
 
again, every soveraign cause justice taught, which
 (consisting taking man his) much say, to
 cause men taught deprive neighbour, violence,
 fraud, thing soveraign authority theirs. of
 things held propriety, dearest man own
 life, & limbs; next degree, (in men,) that
 concern conjugall affection; riches means living.
 therefore people taught, abstain violence to

 honour; forcibly rapine, fraudulent surreption one
 anothers goods. purpose also necessary shewed
 evill consequences false judgement, corruption either of
 judges witnesses, whereby distinction propriety taken away,
 justice becomes effect: things intimated the
 sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth commandements.

 one commandement mutuall charity, "thou shalt love thy neighbour

use universities
 
means, conduits, people may receive this
 instruction, wee search, means may opinions,
 contrary peace man-kind, upon weak false principles, have
 neverthelesse deeply rooted them. mean those, have
 precedent chapter specified: men shall judge is
 lawfull unlawfull, law selfe, own
 private judgements; subjects sinne obeying commands the
 common-wealth, unlesse first judged be
 lawfull: propriety riches such, exclude the
 dominion, common-wealth hath same: lawfull
 subjects kill such, call tyrants: soveraign
 power may divided, like; come instilled into
 people means. necessity, covetousnesse keepeth
 attent trades, labour; they, side, whom
 superfluity, sloth carrieth sensuall pleasures, (which
 two sorts men take greatest part man-kind,) diverted
 deep meditation, learning truth, onely the
 matter naturall justice, also sciences necessarily
 requireth, receive notions duty, chiefly divines
 pulpit, partly neighbours, familiar
 acquaintance, faculty discoursing readily, and
 plausibly, seem wiser better learned cases law, and
 conscience, themselves. divines, others make
 shew learning, derive knowledge universities, from
 schooles law, books, men eminent in
 schooles, universities published. therefore
 manifest, instruction people, dependeth wholly, the
 right teaching youth universities. (may men
 say) universities england learned enough already that? or
 will undertake teach universities? hard questions. yet
 first, doubt answer; till towards later end of
 henry eighth, power pope, alwayes upheld the
 power common-wealth, principally universities; that
 doctrines maintained many preachers, soveraign
 power king, many lawyers, others, their
 education there, sufficient argument, though universities
 authors false doctrines, yet knew to
 plant true. contradiction opinions, most
 certain, sufficiently instructed; ’tis no
 wonder, yet retain relish subtile liquor, wherewith
 first seasoned, civill authority. later
 question, fit, needfull say either i, no: for
 man sees doing, may easily perceive think.
 
safety people, requireth further, him, have
 soveraign power, justice equally administred degrees
 people; is, well rich, mighty, poor and
 obscure persons, may righted injuries done them; the
 great, may greater hope impunity, doe violence,
 dishonour, injury meaner sort, one these,
 like one them: consisteth equity; which,
 precept law nature, soveraign much subject,
 meanest people. breaches law, are
 offences common-wealth: some, also
 private persons. concern common-wealth onely, may
 without breach equity pardoned; every man may pardon is
 done himselfe, according discretion. offence
 private man, equity pardoned, without consent
 injured; reasonable satisfaction.
 
inequality subjects, proceedeth acts soveraign power;
 therefore place presence soveraign; that
 say, court justice, inequality kings,
 subjects, presence king kings. honour of
 great persons, valued beneficence, aydes
 give men inferiour rank, all. violences,
 oppressions, injuries do, extenuated, aggravated by
 greatnesse persons; least need commit
 them. consequences partiality towards great, proceed in
 manner. impunity maketh insolence; insolence hatred; hatred,
 endeavour pull oppressing contumelious greatnesse,
 though ruine common-wealth.
 



equall taxes
 
equall justice, appertaineth also equall imposition taxes;
 equality whereof dependeth equality riches, the
 equality debt, every man oweth common-wealth his
 defence. enough, man labour maintenance
 life; also fight, (if need be,) securing his
 labour. must either jewes return from
 captivity, re-edifying temple, build one hand, hold the
 sword other; else must hire others fight them. for
 impositions layd people soveraign power, are
 nothing else wages, due hold publique sword,
 defend private men exercise severall trades, callings.
 seeing benefit every one receiveth thereby, the
 enjoyment life, equally dear poor, rich; debt
 poor man oweth defend life, a
 rich man oweth defence his; saving rich, have
 service poor, may debtors onely persons,
 many more. considered, equality imposition,
 consisteth rather equality consumed, the
 riches persons consume same. reason there,
 laboureth much, sparing fruits labour,
 consumeth little, charged, living idlely,
 getteth little, spendeth gets; seeing one hath no
 protection common-wealth, other? the
 impositions, layd upon things men consume, every man
 payeth equally useth: common-wealth defrauded, by
 luxurious waste private men.
 



publique charity
 
whereas many men, accident unevitable, become unable maintain
 labour; left charity
 private persons; provided for, (as far-forth the
 necessities nature require,) lawes common-wealth. for
 uncharitablenesse man, neglect impotent; it
 soveraign common-wealth, expose hazard of
 uncertain charity.
 



prevention idlenesse
 
strong bodies, case otherwise: to
 forced work; avoyd excuse finding employment,
 lawes, may encourage manner arts; as
 navigation, agriculture, fishing, manner manifacture that
 requires labour. multitude poor, yet strong people still
 encreasing, transplanted countries sufficiently
 inhabited: neverthelesse, exterminate they
 find there; constrain inhabit closer together, range
 great deal ground, snatch find; court each
 little plot art labour, give sustenance due
 season. world overchargd inhabitants, the
 last remedy warre; provideth every man, victory,
 death.
 



good lawes what
 
care soveraign, belongeth making good lawes. but
 good law? good law, mean just law: law can
 unjust. law made soveraign power, done
 power, warranted, owned every one people; and
 every man will so, man can say unjust. in
 lawes common-wealth, lawes gaming: whatsoever
 gamesters agree on, injustice none them. good law
 that, needfull, good people, withall
 perspicuous.
 



necessary
 
use lawes, (which rules authorised) bind
 people voluntary actions; direct keep in
 motion, hurt impetuous desires,
 rashnesse, indiscretion, hedges set, stop travellers,
 keep way. therefore law needfull,
 true end law, good. law may conceived to
 good, benefit soveraign; though be
 necessary people; so. good the
 soveraign people, separated. weak soveraign, that
 weak subjects; weak people, whose soveraign wanteth power to
 rule will. unnecessary lawes good lawes; trapps
 mony: right soveraign power acknowledged, are
 superfluous; acknowledged, unsufficient defend
 people.
 



perspicuous
 
perspicuity, consisteth much words law it
 selfe, declaration causes, motives, was
 made. it, shewes us meaning legislator, the
 meaning legislator known, law easily understood
 few, many words. words, subject ambiguity;
 therefore multiplication words body law, is
 multiplication ambiguity: besides seems imply, (by much
 diligence,) whosoever can evade words, without compasse
 law. cause many unnecessary processes. when
 consider short lawes antient times; they
 grew degrees still longer; thinks see contention the
 penners, pleaders law; former seeking circumscribe
 later; later evade circumscriptions; the
 pleaders got victory. belongeth therefore office of
 legislator, (such common-wealths supreme
 representative, one man, assembly,) make reason
 perspicuous, law made; body law selfe, as
 short, proper, significant termes, may be.
 



punishments
 
belongeth also office soveraign, make right
 application punishments, rewards. seeing end punishing
 revenge, discharge choler; correction, either the
 offender, others example; severest punishments to
 inflicted crimes, danger the
 publique; proceed malice government
 established; spring contempt justice; that
 provoke indignation multitude; those, unpunished, seem
 authorised, committed sonnes, servants, favorites
 men authority: indignation carrieth men, onely the
 actors, authors injustice; power likely
 protect them; case tarquin; insolent act of
 one sonnes, driven rome, monarchy selfe
 dissolved. crimes infirmity; proceed
 great provocation, great fear, great need, ignorance
 whether fact great crime, not, place many times for
 lenity, without prejudice common-wealth; lenity is
 place it, required law nature. punishment of
 leaders, teachers commotion; poore seduced people,
 punished, can profit common-wealth example.
 severe people, punish ignorance, may in
 great part imputed soveraign, whose fault was, no
 better instructed.
 



rewards
 
like manner belongeth office, duty soveraign,
 apply rewards alwayes so, may arise benefit
 common-wealth: wherein consisteth use, end; then
 done, well served common-wealth, with
 little expence common treasure, possible, well
 recompenced, others thereby may encouraged, serve same
 faithfully can, study arts may be
 enabled better. buy mony, preferment, popular
 ambitious subject, quiet, desist making ill impressions
 mindes people, nothing nature reward; (which
 ordained disservice, service past;) signe of
 gratitude, fear: tend benefit, the
 dammage publique. contention ambition, like of
 hercules monster hydra, many heads, every one
 vanquished, grew three. like manner, the
 stubbornnesse one popular man, overcome reward, arise
 many (by example) mischiefe, hope like
 benefit: sorts manifacture, also malice encreaseth by
 vendible. though sometimes civill warre, may differred,
 wayes that, yet danger growes still greater, the
 publique ruine assured. therefore duty the
 soveraign, publique safety committed, reward those
 aspire greatnesse disturbing peace country, and
 rather oppose beginnings men, little danger,
 longer time greater.
 



counsellours
 
another businesse soveraign, choose good counsellours;
 mean such, whose advice take government the
 common-wealth. word counsell, consilium, corrupted from
 considium, large signification, comprehendeth assemblies
 men sit together, onely deliberate done
 hereafter, also judge facts past, law present.
 take first sense onely: sense, no
 choyce counsell, neither democracy, aristocracy; the
 persons counselling members person counselled. choyce
 counsellours therefore monarchy; which, soveraign that
 endeavoureth make choyce those, every kind the
 able, dischargeth office do. able
 counsellours, least hope benefit giving evill
 counsell, knowledge things conduce peace,
 defence common-wealth. hard matter know who
 expecteth benefit publique troubles; signes guide a
 just suspicion, soothing people unreasonable,
 irremediable grievances, men whose estates sufficient to
 discharge accustomed expences, may easily observed any
 one concerns know it. know, knowledge of
 publique affaires, yet harder; know them, need them
 great deale lesse. know, knowes rules almost any
 art, great degree knowledge art; no
 man can assured truth anothers rules, first
 taught understand them. best signes knowledge any
 art, are, much conversing it, constant good effects it. good
 counsell comes lot, inheritance; therefore no
 reason expect good advice rich, noble, matter
 state, delineating dimensions fortresse; unlesse we
 shall think needs method study politiques, (as
 study geometry,) onely lookers on; which
 so. politiques harder study two. whereas
 parts europe, hath taken right certain
 persons, place highest councell state inheritance;
 derived conquests antient germans; wherein many
 absolute lords joyning together conquer nations, not
 enter confederacy, without priviledges, might be
 marks difference time following, posterity, the
 posterity subjects; priviledges inconsistent with
 soveraign power, favour soveraign, may seem to
 keep; contending right, must needs by
 degrees let go, last honour, adhaereth
 naturally abilities.
 
able soever counsellours affaire, benefit
 counsell greater, give every one advice, and
 reasons apart, assembly, way of
 orations; praemeditated, speak the
 sudden; time, survey consequences
 action; lesse subject carried away contradiction,
 envy, emulation, passions arising difference
 opinion.
 
best counsell, things concern nations, but
 onely ease, benefit subjects may enjoy, lawes that
 look onely inward, taken generall informations, and
 complaints people province, best acquainted
 wants, therefore, demand nothing in
 derogation essentiall rights soveraignty, diligently
 taken notice of. without essentiall rights, (as often
 said,) common-wealth subsist.
 



commanders
 
commander army chiefe, popular, shall be
 beloved, feared army; consequently
 performe office good successe. must therefore be
 industrious, valiant, affable, liberall fortunate, may gain
 opinion sufficiency, loving souldiers. is
 popularity, breeds souldiers desire, courage, to
 recommend favour; protects severity of
 generall, punishing (when need is) mutinous, negligent
 souldiers. love souldiers, (if caution given of
 commanders fidelity,) dangerous thing soveraign power;
 especially hands assembly popular. it
 belongeth therefore safety people, good
 conductors, faithfull subjects, soveraign commits his
 armies.
 
soveraign himselfe popular, is, reverenced and
 beloved people, danger popularity of
 subject. souldiers never generally unjust, side with
 captain; though love him, soveraign, they
 love onely person, also cause. therefore those,
 violence time suppressed power lawfull
 soveraign, settle place, been
 alwayes put trouble contriving titles, save the
 people shame receiving them. known right to
 soveraign power, popular quality, needs no
 more, part, turn hearts subjects him, but
 see able absolutely govern family: nor, the
 part enemies, disbanding armies. greatest
 active part mankind, never hetherto well contented
 present.
 
concerning offices one soveraign another, are
 comprehended law, commonly called law nations,
 need say thing place; law nations, and
 law nature, thing. every soveraign hath same
 right, procuring safety people, particular man
 can have, procuring safety body. law,
 dictateth men civil government, to
 do, avoyd regard one another, dictateth to
 common-wealths, is, consciences soveraign princes, and
 soveraign assemblies; court naturall justice, but
 conscience onely; man, god raigneth; whose lawes,
 (such oblige mankind,) respect god, the
 author nature, naturall; respect god, is
 king kings, lawes. kingdome god, king kings,
 king also peculiar people, shall speak rest this
 discourse.
 


chapter xxxi. kingdome god nature
 



scope following chapters
 
condition meer nature, say, absolute liberty,
 theirs, neither soveraigns, subjects, is
 anarchy, condition warre: praecepts, men
 guided avoyd condition, lawes nature: that
 common-wealth, without soveraign power, word, without
 substance, stand: subjects owe soveraigns, simple
 obedience, things, wherein obedience repugnant
 lawes god, sufficiently proved, have
 already written. wants onely, entire knowledge civill
 duty, know lawes god. without that, man knows
 not, commanded thing civill power, whether be
 contrary law god, not: so, either much civill
 obedience, offends divine majesty, feare offending
 god, transgresses commandements common-wealth. avoyd both
 rocks, necessary know lawes divine. and
 seeing knowledge law, dependeth knowledge the
 soveraign power; shall say something followeth, the
 kingdome god.
 



subjects kingdome god
 
"god king, let earth rejoice," saith psalmist. (psal. 96. 1).
 again, "god king though nations angry; sitteth
 cherubins, though earth moved." (psal. 98. 1). whether
 men will not, must subject alwayes divine power. by
 denying existence, providence god, men may shake their
 ease, yoke. call power god, extendeth
 selfe onely man, also beasts, plants, bodies
 inanimate, name kingdome, metaphoricall use of
 word. onely properly said raigne, governs his
 subjects, word, promise rewards obey
 it, threatning punishment obey not. subjects
 therefore kingdome god, bodies inanimate, nor
 creatures irrationall; understand precepts his: nor
 atheists; believe god care actions
 mankind; acknowledge word his, hope of
 rewards, fear threatnings. therefore believe
 god governeth world, hath given praecepts, and
 propounded rewards, punishments mankind, gods subjects; all
 rest, understood enemies.
 



threefold word god, reason, revelation, prophecy
 
rule words, requires words manifestly made known;
 else lawes: nature lawes belongeth a
 sufficient, clear promulgation, may take away excuse of
 ignorance; lawes men one onely kind, that
 is, proclamation, promulgation voyce man. god
 declareth lawes three wayes; dictates naturall reason, by
 revelation, voyce man, operation of
 miracles, procureth credit rest. hence ariseth
 triple word god, rational, sensible, prophetique: which
 correspondeth triple hearing; right reason, sense supernaturall, and
 faith. sense supernaturall, consisteth revelation, or
 inspiration, universall lawes given, because
 god speaketh manner, particular persons, to
 divers men divers things.
 
twofold kingdome god, naturall prophetique difference
 two kinds gods word, rationall, prophetique,
 may attributed god, two-fold kingdome, naturall, and
 prophetique: naturall, wherein governeth many mankind as
 acknowledge providence, naturall dictates right reason;
 prophetique, wherein chosen one peculiar nation (the
 jewes) subjects, governed them, none them, onely
 naturall reason, positive lawes, gave the
 mouths holy prophets. naturall kingdome god intend to
 speak chapter.
 
right gods soveraignty derived omnipotence right
 nature, whereby god reigneth men, punisheth that
 break lawes, derived, creating them, if
 required obedience, gratitude benefits; his
 irresistible power. formerly shewn, soveraign right
 ariseth pact: shew right may arise nature,
 requires more, shew case never taken away.
 seeing men nature right things, right every
 one reigne rest. right be
 obtained force, concerned safety every one, laying that
 right, set men (with soveraign authority) common consent,
 rule defend them: whereas man power
 irresistible; reason, power
 ruled, defended himselfe, them, according own
 discretion. therefore whose power irresistible, dominion
 men adhaereth naturally excellence power; and
 consequently power, kingdome men, and
 right afflicting men pleasure, belongeth naturally god
 almighty; creator, gracious; omnipotent. though
 punishment due sinne onely, word understood
 affliction sinne; yet right afflicting, alwayes
 derived mens sinne, gods power.
 



sinne cause affliction
 
question, "why evill men often prosper, good men suffer
 adversity," much disputed antient, same
 ours, "by right god dispenseth prosperities and
 adversities life;" difficulty, hath shaken
 faith, onely vulgar, philosophers, is
 more, saints, concerning divine providence. "how good," saith
 david, "is god israel upright heart; yet
 feet almost gone, treadings well-nigh slipt; was
 grieved wicked, saw ungodly prosperity."
 job, earnestly expostulate god, many
 afflictions suffered, notwithstanding righteousnesse? this
 question case job, decided god himselfe, by
 arguments derived job’s sinne, power. whereas the
 friends job drew arguments affliction sinne,
 defended himselfe conscience innocence, god
 himselfe taketh matter, justified affliction by
 arguments drawn power, "where thou i
 layd foundations earth," like, approved
 job’s innocence, reproved erroneous doctrine friends.
 conformable doctrine sentence saviour, concerning
 man born blind, words, "neither hath man
 sinned, fathers; works god might made
 manifest him." though said "that death entred the
 world sinne," (by meant adam never sinned, had
 never dyed, is, never suffered separation soule his
 body,) follows thence, god justly afflicted
 him, though sinned, well afflicteth living
 creatures, sinne.
 



divine lawes
 
spoken right gods soveraignty, grounded onely on
 nature; consider next, divine lawes, dictates
 naturall reason; lawes concern either naturall duties of
 one man another, honour naturally due divine soveraign.
 first lawes nature, spoken already
 14. 15. chapters treatise; namely, equity, justice,
 mercy, humility, rest morall vertues. remaineth
 therefore consider, praecepts dictated men, their
 naturall reason onely, without word god, touching honour
 worship divine majesty.
 



honour worship what
 
honour consisteth inward thought, opinion power, and
 goodnesse another: therefore honour god, think highly
 power goodnesse, possible. opinion, the
 externall signes appearing words, actions men, called
 worship; one part latines understand the
 word cultus: cultus signifieth properly, constantly, labour
 man bestowes thing, purpose make benefit it.
 now things whereof make benefit, either subject us, and
 profit yeeld, followeth labour bestow upon them, a
 naturall effect; subject us, answer labour,
 according wills. first sense labour bestowed on
 earth, called culture; education children culture of
 mindes. second sense, mens wills wrought to
 purpose, force, compleasance, signifieth much as
 courting, is, winning favour good offices; praises,
 acknowledging power, whatsoever pleasing from
 look benefit. properly worship: which
 sense publicola, understood worshipper people, and
 cultus dei, worship god.
 



severall signes honour
 
internall honour, consisting opinion power goodnesse,
 arise three passions; love, hath reference goodnesse; hope,
 fear, relate power: three parts externall worship;
 praise, magnifying, blessing: subject praise, being
 goodnesse; subject magnifying, blessing, power, the
 effect thereof felicity. praise, magnifying significant by
 words, actions: words, say man good, great:
 actions, thank bounty, obey power. the
 opinion happinesse another, can onely expressed words.
 



worship naturall arbitrary
 
signes honour, (both attributes actions,) that
 naturally so; amongst attributes, good, just, liberall, the
 like; amongst actions, prayers, thanks, obedience. others are
 institution, custome men; times places are
 honourable; others dishonourable; others indifferent: are
 gestures salutation, prayer, thanksgiving, different
 times places, differently used. former naturall; later
 arbitrary worship.
 



worship commanded free
 
arbitrary worship, bee two differences: sometimes is
 commanded, sometimes voluntary worship: commanded, such
 hee requireth, worshipped: free, the
 worshipper thinks fit. commanded, words, gestures,
 obedience worship. free, worship consists
 opinion beholders: words, actions by
 intend honour, seem ridiculous, tending contumely; they
 worship; signe signe giveth it,
 made; is, spectator.
 



worship publique private
 
again, publique, private worship. publique, the
 worship common-wealth performeth, one person. private, that
 private person exhibiteth. publique, respect whole
 common-wealth, free; respect particular men so.
 private, secret free; sight multitude, is
 never without restraint, either lawes, opinion
 men; contrary nature liberty.
 



end worship
 
end worship amongst men, power. man seeth another
 worshipped supposeth powerfull, readier obey him;
 makes power greater. god ends: worship do
 him, proceeds duty, directed according capacity,
 rules honour, reason dictateth done weak
 potent men, hope benefit, fear dammage, in
 thankfulnesse good already received them.
 



attributes divine honour
 
may know worship god taught us light of
 nature, will begin attributes. where, first, manifest,
 attribute existence: man can will to
 honour that, thinks beeing.
 
secondly, philosophers, sayd world, soule of
 world god, spake unworthily him; denyed existence:
 god, understood cause world; say world
 god, say cause it, is, god.
 
thirdly, say world created, eternall, (seeing that
 eternall cause,) deny god.
 
fourthly, attributing (as think) ease god, take
 care mankind; take honour: takes
 away mens love, fear him; root honour.
 
fifthly, things signifie greatnesse, power; say he
 finite, honour him: signe will to
 honour god, attribute lesse can; finite, lesse
 can; finite, easie adde more.
 
therefore attribute figure him, honour; figure is
 finite:
 
say conceive, imagine, idea him, our
 mind: whatsoever conceive finite:
 
attribute parts, totality; attributes
 onely things finite:
 
say this, place: whatsoever place, is
 bounded, finite:
 
moved, resteth: attributes ascribe to
 place:
 
gods one; implies all
 finite: one infinite: ascribe to
 (unlesse metaphorically, meaning passion, effect)
 passions partake griefe; repentance, anger, mercy: of
 want; appetite, hope, desire; passive faculty: passion,
 power limited somewhat else.
 
therefore ascribe god will, understood,
 man, rationall appetite; power, he
 effecteth every thing.
 
likewise attribute sight, acts sense; as
 also knowledge, understanding; us nothing else, but
 tumult mind, raised externall things presse the
 organicall parts mans body: thing god; and
 things depend naturall causes, attributed to
 him.
 
hee will attribute god, nothing warranted by
 naturall reason, must either use negative attributes, infinite,
 eternall, incomprehensible; superlatives, high, great,
 like; indefinite, good, just, holy, creator; such
 sense, meant declare is, (for to
 circumscribe within limits fancy,) much wee
 admire him, ready obey him; signe of
 humility, will honour much can: is
 one name signifie conception nature, is, i
 am: one name relation us, god; is
 contained father, king, lord.
 



actions signes divine honour
 
concerning actions divine worship, generall precept
 reason, signes intention honour god; as
 are, first, prayers: carvers, made images, were
 thought make gods; people prayed them.
 
secondly, thanksgiving; differeth prayer divine worship,
 otherwise, prayers precede, thanks succeed benefit;
 end one, other, acknowledge god, for
 author benefits, well past, future.
 
thirdly, gifts; say, sacrifices, oblations, (if be
 best,) signes honour: thanksgivings.
 
fourthly, swear god, naturally signe honour:
 confession god onely knoweth heart; no
 mans wit, strength can protect man gods vengence the
 perjured.
 
fifthly, part rationall worship, speak considerately
 god; argues fear him, fear, confession his
 power. hence followeth, name god used rashly,
 purpose; much, vain: to
 purpose; unlesse way oath, order the
 common-wealth, make judgements certain; common-wealths,
 avoyd warre. disputing gods nature contrary his
 honour: supposed, naturall kingdome god, there
 way know thing, naturall reason; is, from
 principles naturall science; farre teaching us
 thing gods nature, teach us nature, nor
 nature smallest creature living. therefore, men out
 principles naturall reason, dispute attributes god,
 dishonour him: attributes give god, we
 consider signification philosophicall truth; the
 signification pious intention, greatest honour are
 able. want consideration, proceeded volumes
 disputation nature god, tend honour, but
 honour wits, learning; nothing else but
 inconsiderate, vain abuses sacred name.
 
sixthly, prayers, thanksgivings, offerings sacrifices, a
 dictate naturall reason, every one kind the
 best, significant honour. example, prayers, and
 thanksgiving, made words phrases, sudden, light, nor
 plebeian; beautifull well composed; else god
 much honour can. therefore heathens absurdly, to
 worship images gods: verse, musick,
 voyce, instruments, reasonable. also beasts
 offered sacrifice, gifts offered, actions
 worshipping, full submission, commemorative benefits
 received, according reason, proceeding intention to
 honour him.
 
seventhly, reason directeth onely worship god secret; but
 also, especially, publique, sight men: without
 that, (that honour acceptable) procuring others to
 honour him, lost.
 
lastly, obedience lawes (that is, case lawes
 nature,) greatest worship all. obedience is
 acceptable god sacrifice; also set light his
 commandements, greatest contumelies. the
 lawes divine worship, naturall reason dictateth private
 men.
 



publique worship consisteth uniformity
 
seeing common-wealth one person, also exhibite
 god one worship; doth, commandeth be
 exhibited private men, publiquely. publique worship; the
 property whereof, uniforme: actions done
 differently, different men, said publique worship.
 therefore, many sorts worship allowed, proceeding from
 different religions private men, said any
 publique worship, common-wealth religion all.
 



attributes depend lawes civill
 
words (and consequently attributes god) their
 signification agreement, constitution men; attributes
 held significative honour, men intend shall be; and
 whatsoever may done wills particular men, no
 law reason, may done will common-wealth, lawes
 civill. common-wealth hath will, makes lawes,
 made will him, the
 soveraign power; followeth, attributes soveraign
 ordaineth, worship god, signes honour, be
 taken used such, private men publique worship.
 



actions
 
actions signes constitution; are
 naturally signes honour, others contumely, later (which are
 men ashamed sight reverence)
 made humane power part divine worship; former
 (such decent, modest, humble behaviour) ever separated from
 it. whereas infinite number actions, gestures, of
 indifferent nature; common-wealth shall ordain to
 publiquely universally use, signes honour, part of
 gods worship, taken used subjects. and
 said scripture, "it better obey god than
 men," hath place kingdome god pact, nature.
 



naturall punishments
 
thus briefly spoken naturall kingdome god, his
 naturall lawes, will adde onely chapter short declaration of
 naturall punishments. action man life, that
 beginning long chayn consequences, humane
 providence, high enough, give man prospect end. and
 chayn, linked together pleasing unpleasing

christian politiques
 
derived rights soveraigne power, duty subjects
 hitherto, principles nature onely; experience has
 found true, consent (concerning use words) made so; that
 say, nature men, known us experience, and
 definitions (of words essentiall politicall
 reasoning) universally agreed on. next handle, which
 nature rights christian common-wealth, whereof there
 dependeth much upon supernaturall revelations will god; the
 ground discourse must be, naturall word god, but
 also propheticall.
 
neverthelesse, renounce senses, experience; nor
 (that undoubted word god) naturall reason. they
 talents hath put hands negotiate, till the
 coming blessed saviour; therefore folded up
 napkin implicate faith, employed purchase of
 justice, peace, true religion, though many things in
 gods word reason; say, naturall reason
 either demonstrated, confuted; yet nothing contrary
 it; seemeth so, fault either unskilfull
 interpretation, erroneous ratiocination.
 
therefore, thing therein written hard our
 examination, wee bidden captivate understanding words;
 labour sifting philosophicall truth logick, of
 mysteries comprehensible, fall rule of
 naturall science. mysteries religion, with
 wholsome pills sick, swallowed whole, vertue to
 cure; chewed, part cast without effect.
 



captivate understanding
 
captivity understanding, meant submission of
 intellectual faculty, opinion man; of
 will obedience, obedience due. sense, memory,
 understanding, reason, opinion power change; but
 alwaies, necessarily such, things see, hear, consider
 suggest unto us; therefore effects will, will
 them. captivate understanding reason, forbear
 contradiction; speak, (by lawfull authority) are
 commanded; live accordingly; sum, trust, and
 faith reposed speaketh, though mind incapable any
 notion words spoken.
 



god speaketh men
 
god speaketh man, must either immediately; mediation
 another man, formerly spoken immediately.
 god speaketh man immediately, may understood well
 enough, hath spoken; understood
 another, hard, impossible know. man pretend to
 me, god hath spoken supernaturally, immediately, i
 make doubt it, easily perceive argument can produce,
 oblige beleeve it. true, soveraign,
 may oblige obedience, so, act word declare i
 beleeve not; think otherwise reason perswades
 me. one hath authority me, shall pretend the
 same, nothing exacteth either beleefe, obedience.
 
say god hath spoken holy scripture, not
 say god hath spoken immediately, mediation the
 prophets, apostles, church, manner he
 speaks christian men. say hath spoken a
 dream, say dreamed god spake him; is
 force win beleef man, knows dreams for
 part naturall, may proceed former thoughts; such
 dreams that, selfe conceit, foolish arrogance, false
 opinion mans godlinesse, vertue, thinks he
 hath merited favour extraordinary revelation. say hath
 seen vision, heard voice, say, hath dreamed between
 sleeping waking: manner man doth many times naturally
 take dream vision, well observed own
 slumbering. say speaks supernaturall inspiration, say he
 finds ardent desire speak, strong opinion himself, for
 can alledge naturall sufficient reason. that
 though god almighty can speak man, dreams, visions, voice, and
 inspiration; yet obliges man beleeve hath done him
 pretends it; (being man), may erre, (which more) may
 lie.
 



marks prophets known
 
can he, god hath never revealed wil immediately
 (saving way natural reason) know obey, not
 obey word, delivered him, sayes prophet? (1 kings
 22) 400 prophets, k. israel asked counsel, concerning
 warre made ramoth gilead, micaiah true one.(1
 kings 13) prophet sent prophecy altar set up
 jeroboam, though true prophet, two miracles done in
 presence appears prophet sent god, yet deceived by
 another old prophet, perswaded mouth god, eat
 drink him. one prophet deceive another, certainty is
 knowing will god, way reason? to
 answer holy scripture, two marks, by
 together, asunder, true prophet known. one the
 miracles; teaching religion than
 already established. asunder (i say) neither is
 sufficient. (deut. 13 v. 1,2,3,4,5 ) "if prophet rise amongst you, or
 dreamer dreams, shall pretend miracle, the
 miracle come passe; say, let us follow strange gods, thou
 hast known, thou shalt hearken him, &c. prophet and
 dreamer dreams shall put death, hath spoken you
 revolt lord god." words two things to
 observed, first, god wil miracles alone serve for
 arguments, approve prophets calling; (as third
 verse) experiment constancy adherence himself.
 works egyptian sorcerers, though great those
 moses, yet great miracles. secondly, great soever the
 miracle be, yet tend stir revolt king, him
 governeth kings authority, doth miracle, is
 considered otherwise sent make triall their
 allegiance. words, "revolt lord god," in
 place equivalent "revolt king." made god
 king pact foot mount sinai; ruled moses
 only; spake god, time time declared gods
 commandements people. like manner, saviour christ
 made disciples acknowledge messiah, (that say,
 gods anointed, nation jews daily expected their
 king, refused came,) omitted advertise the
 danger miracles. "there shall arise," (saith he) "false christs, and
 false prophets, shall doe great wonders miracles, even the
 seducing (if possible) elect." (mat. 24. 24) by
 appears, false prophets may power miracles;
 yet wee take doctrin gods word. st. paul says
 galatians, "if himself, angell heaven
 preach another gospel them, preached, let be
 accursed." (gal. 1. 8) gospel was, christ king; that
 preaching power king received, consequence
 words, st. paul accursed. speech addressed to
 those, preaching already received jesus christ,
 say, king jews.
 



marks prophet old law, miracles, doctrine
 conformable law
 
miracles, without preaching doctrine god hath
 established; preaching true doctrine, without of
 miracles, unsufficient argument immediate revelation. if
 man teacheth false doctrine, pretend bee prophet
 without shewing miracle, never bee regarded for
 pretence, evident deut. 18. v. 21, 22. "if thou say in
 thy heart, shall know word (of prophet) that
 lord hath spoken. prophet shall spoken the
 name lord, shall come passe, that’s word
 lord hath spoken, prophet spoken of
 pride heart, fear not." man may ask,
 prophet hath foretold thing, shal know whether will
 come passe not? may foretel thing arrive after
 certain long time, longer time mans life; indefinitely,
 will come passe one time other: case mark
 prophet unusefull; therefore miracles oblige us to
 beleeve prophet, confirmed immediate, not
 long deferr’d event. manifest, teaching of
 religion god hath established, showing present
 miracle, joined together, marks whereby scripture
 true prophet, say immediate revelation be
 acknowledged; neither singly sufficient oblige any
 man regard saith.
 



miracles ceasing, prophets cease, scripture supplies place
 
seeing therefore miracles now cease, sign left, whereby to
 acknowledge pretended revelations, inspirations private
 man; obligation give ear doctrine, farther is
 conformable holy scriptures, since time saviour,
 supply want prophecy; which, wise and
 careful ratiocination, rules precepts necessary knowledge
 duty god man, without enthusiasme, supernaturall
 inspiration, may easily deduced. scripture it, of
 take principles discourse, concerning the
 rights supream govenors earth, christian
 common-wealths; duty christian subjects towards their
 soveraigns. end, shall speak next chapter, the
 books, writers, scope authority bible.
 



chapter xxxiii. number, antiquity, scope, authority, and
 interpreters books holy scripture
 



books holy scripture
 
books holy scripture, understood those, be
 canon, say, rules christian life. all
 rules life, men conscience bound observe, laws;
 question scripture, question law throughout
 christendome, naturall, civill. though not
 determined scripture, laws every christian king shall constitute
 dominions; yet determined laws shall not
 constitute. seeing therefore already proved, soveraigns
 dominions sole legislators; books are
 canonicall, is, law, every nation, established for
 soveraign authority. true, god soveraign
 soveraigns; therefore, speaks subject, he
 obeyed, whatsoever earthly potentate command the
 contrary. question obedience god, when,
 god hath said; subjects supernaturall
 revelation, known, naturall reason, guided
 them, obtaining peace justice, obey authority
 severall common-wealths; say, lawfull
 soveraigns. according obligation, can acknowledge other
 books old testament, holy scripture, have
 commanded acknowledged such, authority the
 church england. books are, sufficiently known, without
 catalogue here; acknowledged
 st. jerome, holdeth rest, namely, wisdome solomon,
 ecclesiasticus, judith, tobias, first second maccabees,
 (though seen first hebrew) third fourth of
 esdras, apocrypha. canonicall, josephus learned jew, that
 wrote time emperor domitian, reckoneth twenty two, making
 number agree hebrew alphabet. st. jerome same,
 though reckon different manner. josephus numbers five
 books moses, thirteen prophets, writ history own
 times (which agrees prophets writings contained the
 bible wee shall see hereafter), four hymnes morall precepts.
 st. jerome reckons five books moses, eight prophets, nine
 holy writ, calls hagiographa. septuagint, who
 70. learned men jews, sent ptolemy king egypt, to
 translate jewish law, hebrew greek, left us
 holy scripture greek tongue, are
 received church england.
 
books new testament, equally acknowledged for
 canon christian churches, sects christians, that
 admit books canonicall.
 



antiquity
 
originall writers severall books holy scripture,
 made evident sufficient testimony history,
 (which proof matter fact); can arguments
 naturall reason; reason serves convince truth (not
 fact, but) consequence. light therefore must guide us in
 question, must held unto us bookes
 themselves: light, though show us writer every
 book, yet unusefull give us knowledge time, wherein
 written.
 



pentateuch written moses
 
first, pentateuch, argument enough were
 written moses, called five books moses; no
 titles, book joshua, book judges, book
 ruth, books kings, arguments sufficient prove,
 written joshua, judges, ruth, the
 kings. titles books, subject marked, often the
 writer. history livy, denotes writer; history of
 scanderbeg, denominated subject. read last chapter
 deuteronomie, ver. 6. concerning sepulcher moses, "that man
 knoweth sepulcher day," is, day wherein those
 words written. therefore manifest, words were
 written interrement. strange interpretation, to
 say moses spake sepulcher (though prophecy), was
 found day, wherein yet living. may perhaps
 alledged, last chapter only, whole pentateuch, was
 written man, rest not: let us therefore consider
 find book genesis, chap. 12. ver. 6 "and abraham
 passed land place sichem, unto plain moreh,
 canaanite land;" must needs bee the
 words one wrote canaanite land; and
 consequently, moses, dyed came it. likewise
 numbers 21. ver. 14. writer citeth another ancient book,
 entituled, book warres lord, wherein registred
 acts moses, red-sea, brook arnon. is
 therefore sufficiently evident, five books moses were
 written time, though long manifest.
 
though moses compile books entirely, form
 them; yet wrote hee said have
 written: example, volume law, contained, as
 seemeth 11 deuteronomie, following chapters the
 27. also commanded written stones, entry
 land canaan. (deut. 31. 9) moses himself
 write, deliver priests elders israel, read
 every seventh year israel, assembling feast of
 tabernacles. law god commanded, kings
 (when established form government) take
 copy priests levites lay side arke;
 (deut. 31. 26) lost, long time after
 found hilkiah, sent king josias, causing be
 read people, renewed covenant god them. (2 king.
 22. 8 & 23. 1,2,3)
 



book joshua written time
 
book joshua also written long time joshua,
 may gathered many places book self. joshua had
 set twelve stones middest jordan, monument their
 passage; (josh 4. 9) writer saith thus, "they there
 unto day;" (josh 5. 9) "unto day", phrase that
 signifieth time past, beyond memory man. like manner, upon
 saying lord, rolled people the
 reproach egypt, writer saith, "the place called gilgal unto
 day;" said time joshua improper.
 also name valley achor, trouble achan
 raised camp, (josh. 7. 26) writer saith, "remaineth unto
 day;" must needs bee therefore long time joshua.
 arguments kind many other; josh. 8. 29. 13. 13. 14.
 14. 15. 63.
 



booke judges ruth written long captivity
 
manifest like arguments book judges, chap. 1.
 21,26 6.24 10.4 15.19 17.6 ruth 1. 1. especially judg. 18. 30.
 said, jonathan "and sonnes priests the
 tribe dan, untill day captivity land."
 



like bookes samuel
 
books samuel also written time, there
 like arguments, 1 sam. 5.5. 7.13,15. 27.6. & 30.25. where, after
 david adjudged equall part spoiles, guarded
 ammunition, fought, writer saith, "he made a
 statute ordinance israel day." (2. sam. 6.4.) again,
 david (displeased, lord slain uzzah, putting out
 hand sustain ark,) called place perez-uzzah, writer
 saith, called "to day": time therefore writing
 book, must long time fact; is, long
 time david.
 



books kings, chronicles
 
two books kings, two books chronicles,
 besides places mention monuments, writer saith,
 remained till days; 1 kings 9.13. 9.21. 10. 12.
 12.19. 2 kings 2.22. 8.22. 10.27. 14.7. 16.6. 17.23. 17.34. 17.41. 1
 chron. 4.41. 5.26. argument sufficient written the
 captivity babylon, history continued till that
 time. facts registred alwaies ancient books
 make mention of, quote register; books doe divers
 places, referring reader chronicles kings juda,
 chronicles kings israel, books prophet
 samuel, prophet nathan, prophet ahijah; vision of
 jehdo, books prophet serveiah, prophet addo.
 



ezra nehemiah
 
books esdras nehemiah written certainly their
 return captivity; return, re-edification of
 walls houses jerusalem, renovation covenant, and
 ordination policy therein contained.
 



esther
 
history queen esther time captivity; and
 therefore writer must time, it.
 



job
 
book job hath mark time wherein written:
 though appear sufficiently (exekiel 14.14, james 5.11.)
 fained person; yet book self seemeth be
 history, treatise concerning question ancient time much
 disputed, "why wicked men often prospered world, good
 men afflicted;" probably, the
 beginning, third verse third chapter, complaint
 job beginneth, hebrew (as st. jerome testifies) prose; and
 thence sixt verse last chapter hexameter verses;
 rest chapter prose. dispute all
 verse; prose added, preface beginning, and
 epilogue end. verse usuall stile such, either
 great pain, job; come comfort
 them, friends; philosophy, especially morall philosophy,
 ancient time frequent.
 



psalter
 
psalmes written part david, use the
 quire. added songs moses, holy men; and
 return captivity; 137. the
 126. whereby manifest psalter compiled, put into
 form now hath, return jews babylon.
 



proverbs
 
proverbs, collection wise godly sayings, partly of
 solomon, partly agur jakeh; partly mother
 king lemuel, probably thought collected by
 solomon, rather agur, mother lemues; that, though
 sentences theirs, yet collection compiling this
 one book, work godly man, lived them
 all.
 



ecclesiastes canticles
 
books ecclesiastes canticles nothing not
 solomons, except titles, inscriptions. "the words of
 preacher, david, king jerusalem;" and, "the song of
 songs, solomon’s," seem made distinctions
 sake, then, books scripture gathered one body of
 law; end, doctrine only, authors also
 might extant.
 



prophets
 
prophets, ancient, sophoniah, jonas, amos, hosea,
 isaiah michaiah, lived time amaziah, azariah,
 otherwise ozias, kings judah. book jonas properly
 register prophecy, (for contained words,
 "fourty dayes ninivy shall destroyed,") history narration
 frowardenesse disputing gods commandements; is
 small probability author, seeing subject of
 it. book amos prophecy.
 
jeremiah, abdias, nahum, habakkuk prophecyed time josiah.
 
ezekiel, daniel, aggeus, zacharias, captivity.
 
joel malachi prophecyed, evident writings. but
 considering inscriptions, titles books, manifest
 enough, whole scripture old testament, set forth in
 form it, return jews captivity
 babylon, time ptolemaeus philadelphus, caused
 bee translated greek seventy men, sent him
 judea purpose. books apocrypha (which
 recommended us church, though canonicall, yet for
 profitable books instruction) may point credited, the
 scripture set forth form wee in, esdras; may
 appear saith, second book, chapt. 14.
 verse 21, 22, &c. speaking god, saith thus, "thy law is
 burnt; therefore man knoweth things thou done, the
 works begin. found grace thee, send
 holy spirit me, shall write hath done
 world, since beginning, written thy law, that
 men may find thy path, will live later days,
 may live." verse 45. "and came passe forty dayes were
 fulfilled, highest spake, saying, ‘the first thou hast
 written, publish openly, worthy unworthy may read it; but
 keep seventy last, thou mayst deliver onely as
 wise among people.’" thus much concerning time the
 writing bookes old testament.
 



new testament
 
writers new testament lived lesse age after
 christs ascension, seen saviour, his
 disciples, except st. paul, st. luke; consequently whatsoever
 written them, ancient time apostles. but
 time wherein books new testament received, and
 acknowledged church writing, altogether so
 ancient. for, bookes old testament derived us, from
 higher time esdras, direction gods spirit
 retrived them, lost: new testament, which
 copies many, easily one private
 mans hand, bee derived higher time, wherein the
 governours church collected, approved, recommended to
 us, writings apostles disciples; whose names
 go. first enumeration bookes, old,
 new testament, canons apostles, supposed be
 collected clement first (after st. peter) bishop rome. but
 supposed, many questioned, councell of
 laodicea first know, recommended bible then
 christian churches, writings prophets apostles: and
 councell held 364. yeer christ. time,
 though ambition far prevailed great doctors church,
 esteem emperours, though christian, shepherds of
 people, sheep; emperours christian, wolves; and
 endeavoured passe doctrine, counsell, information,
 preachers; laws, absolute governours; thought such
 frauds tended make people obedient christian
 doctrine, pious; yet perswaded therefore
 falsifie scriptures, though copies books new
 testament, hands ecclesiasticks; they
 intention doe, surely made more
 favorable power christian princes, civill soveraignty,
 are. see therefore reason doubt, the
 old, new testament, now, true registers of
 things, done said prophets, apostles.
 perhaps books called apocrypha, if
 left canon, inconformity doctrine the
 rest, found hebrew. the
 conquest asia alexander great, learned jews,
 perfect greek tongue. seventy interpreters
 converted bible greek, hebrews; we
 extant works philo josephus jews, written them
 eloquently greek. writer, authority the
 church, maketh book canonicall.
 



scope
 
although books written divers men, yet manifest
 writers indued one spirit, they
 conspire one end, setting forth the
 rights kingdome god, father, son, holy ghost. for
 book genesis, deriveth genealogy gods people, the
 creation world, going egypt: four books of
 moses, contain election god king, laws which
 hee prescribed government: books joshua, judges, ruth,
 samuel, time saul, describe acts gods people,
 till time cast gods yoke, called king, the
 manner neighbour nations; rest history the
 old testament, derives succession line david, the
 captivity, line spring restorer kingdome
 god, even blessed saviour god son, whose coming foretold
 bookes prophets, evangelists writt his
 life, actions, claim kingdome, whilst lived one
 earth: lastly, acts, epistles apostles, declare the
 coming god, holy ghost, authority left them, and
 successors, direction jews, invitation
 gentiles. summe, histories prophecies old
 testament, gospels, epistles new testament, had
 one scope, convert men obedience god; 1. in
 moses, priests; 2. man christ; 3. apostles and
 successors apostolicall power. three several times
 represent person god: moses, successors high
 priests, kings judah, old testament: christ himself, in
 time lived earth: apostles, successors, from
 day pentecost (when holy ghost descended them) this
 day.
 



question authority scriptures stated.
 
question much disputed divers sects christian
 religion, whence scriptures derive authority; which
 question also propounded sometimes terms, as, wee know
 word god, or, beleeve so: the
 difficulty resolving it, ariseth chiefly impropernesse of
 words wherein question self couched. beleeved
 hands, first originall author god; and
 consequently question disputed, that. again, manifest,
 none can know gods word, (though true christians
 beleeve it,) god hath revealed it
 supernaturally; therefore question rightly moved, our
 knowledge it. lastly, question propounded beleefe;
 moved beleeve one, others reasons,
 can rendred one generall answer all. question
 truly stated is, authority made law.
 



authority interpretation
 
far differ laws nature, doubt,
 law god, carry authority them,
 legible men use naturall reason: is
 authority, morall doctrine consonant to
 reason; dictates whereof laws, made, eternall.
 
made law god himselfe, nature written
 law, laws god hath sufficiently
 published them, man can excuse himself, saying, know not
 his.
 
therefore, god hath supernaturally revealed, they
 his, published them, sent him, not
 obliged obey them, authority, his, whose commands have
 already force laws; say, authority, then
 common-wealth, residing soveraign, the
 legislative power. again, legislative authority of
 common-wealth, giveth force laws, must bee
 authority derived god, either private, publique:
 private, obliges onely him, particular god hath been
 pleased reveale it. every man obliged, take for
 gods law, particular men, pretence private inspiration, or
 revelation, obtrude upon him, (in number men, out
 pride, ignorance, take dreams, extravagant fancies,
 madnesse, testimonies gods spirit; ambition,
 pretend divine testimonies, falsely, contrary their
 consciences,) impossible divine law be
 acknowledged. publique, authority common-wealth, or
 church. church, one person, thing
 common-wealth christians; called common-wealth, it
 consisteth men united one person, soveraign; church,
 consisteth christian men, united one christian
 soveraign. church one person, hath no
 authority all; can neither command, doe action all; nor
 capable power, right thing; will,
 reason, voice; qualities personall. now the
 whole number christians contained one common-wealth, they
 one person; universall church hath any
 authority them; therefore scriptures made laws,
 universall church: bee one common-wealth, all
 christian monarchs, states private persons, subject to
 bee judged, deposed, punished universall soveraigne all
 christendome. question authority scriptures is
 reduced this, "whether christian kings, soveraigne assemblies
 christian common-wealths, absolute territories,
 immediately god; subject one vicar christ, constituted
 universall church; bee judged, condemned, deposed, put
 death, hee shall think expedient, necessary common
 good."
 
question bee resolved, without particular
 consideration kingdome god; whence also, wee judge
 authority interpreting scripture. for, whosoever hath a
 lawfull power writing, make law, hath power also to
 approve, disapprove interpretation same.
 


chapter xxxiv. signification spirit, angel, inspiration in
 books holy scripture
 



body spirit taken scripture
 
seeing foundation true ratiocination, constant
 signification words; doctrine following, dependeth not
 (as naturall science) will writer, (as common
 conversation) vulgar use, sense carry the
 scripture; necessary, proceed further, determine,
 bible, meaning words, ambiguity, may
 render inferre upon them, obscure, disputable. will
 begin words body, spirit, language the
 schools termed, substances, corporeall, incorporeall.
 
word body, generall acceptation, signifieth that
 filleth, occupyeth certain room, imagined place; and
 dependeth imagination, reall part call
 universe. universe, aggregate bodies, there
 reall part thereof also body; thing properly
 body, also part (that aggregate bodies) the
 universe. also, bodies subject change, is
 say, variety apparence sense living creatures, is
 called substance, say, subject, various accidents, as
 sometimes moved, sometimes stand still; seem our
 senses sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes one colour, smel,
 tast, sound, somtimes another. diversity seeming,
 (produced diversity operation bodies, organs
 sense) attribute alterations bodies operate, &
 call accidents bodies. according acceptation
 word, substance body, signifie thing; therefore
 substance incorporeall words, joined together,
 destroy one another, man say, incorporeall body.
 
sense common people, universe called body,
 parts thereof can discern sense feeling,
 resist force, sense eyes, hinder them
 farther prospect. therefore common language men, aire,
 aeriall substances, use taken bodies, (as often
 men sensible effects) called wind, breath, or
 (because called latine spiritus) spirits; when
 call aeriall substance, body living
 creature, gives life motion, vitall animall spirits. for
 idols brain, represent bodies us, they
 not, looking-glasse, dream, distempered brain
 waking, (as apostle saith generally idols) nothing;
 nothing all, say, seem bee; brain
 self, nothing tumult, proceeding either action the
 objects, disorderly agitation organs sense.
 men, otherwise imployed, search causes,
 know themselves, call them; may therefore easily be
 perswaded, whose knowledge much reverence, to
 call bodies, think made aire compacted power
 supernaturall, sight judges corporeall; to
 call spirits, sense touch discerneth nothing the
 place appear, resist fingers: proper
 signification spirit common speech, either subtile, fluid,
 invisible body, ghost, idol phantasme the
 imagination. metaphoricall significations, many: for
 sometimes taken disposition inclination mind; as
 disposition controwl sayings men, say,
 spirit contradiction; disposition uncleannesse, unclean
 spirit; perversenesse, froward spirit; sullennesse, dumb
 spirit, inclination godlinesse, gods service, spirit
 god: sometimes eminent ability, extraordinary passion,
 disease mind, great wisdome called spirit of
 wisdome; mad men said possessed spirit.
 
signification spirit find any; none
 can satisfie sense word scripture, place
 falleth humane understanding; faith therein consisteth
 opinion, submission; places god
 said spirit; spirit god, meant god
 himselfe. nature god incomprehensible; say, we
 understand nothing is, is; therefore the
 attributes give him, tell one another, is, nor
 signifie opinion nature, desire honor with
 names conceive honorable amongst selves.
 



spirit god taken scripture sometimes wind, breath
 
gen. 1. 2. "the spirit god moved upon face waters." here
 spirit god meant god himself, motion attributed
 god, consequently place, intelligible bodies,
 substances incorporeall; place our
 understanding, can conceive nothing moved changes place,
 dimension; whatsoever dimension, body. but
 meaning words best understood like place, gen.
 8. 1. earth covered waters, beginning,
 god intending abate them, discover dry land, useth
 like words, "i will bring spirit upon earth, waters shall
 diminished:" place spirit understood wind, (that is
 aire spirit moved,) might called (as former place)
 spirit god, gods work.
 



secondly, extraordinary gifts understanding
 
gen. 41. 38. pharaoh calleth wisdome joseph, spirit god.
 joseph advised look wise discreet man, and
 set land egypt, saith thus, "can find a
 man is, spirit god?" exod. 28.3. "thou
 shalt speak (saith god) wise hearted, filled
 spirit wisdome, make aaron garments, consecrate him."
 extraordinary understanding, though making garments, as
 gift god, called spirit god. found
 again, exod. 31.3,4,5,6. 35.31. isaiah 11.2,3. prophet
 speaking messiah, saith, "the spirit lord shall abide upon
 him, spirit wisdome understanding, spirit counsell,
 fortitude; spirit fear lord." manifestly
 meant, many ghosts, many eminent graces god would
 give him.
 



thirdly, extraordinary affections
 
book judges, extraordinary zeal, courage the
 defence gods people, called spirit god; excited
 othoniel, gideon, jeptha, samson deliver servitude,
 judg. 3.10. 6.34. 11.29. 13.25. 14.6,19. saul, upon newes of
 insolence ammonites towards men jabeth gilead, is
 said (1 sam.11.6.) "the spirit god came upon saul, anger
 (or, latine, fury) kindled greatly." is
 probable meant ghost, extraordinary zeal punish the
 cruelty ammonites. like manner spirit god, came
 upon saul, hee amongst prophets praised god songs,
 musick (1 sam.19.20.) understood, ghost, an
 unexpected sudden zeal join devotions.
 



fourthly, gift prediction dreams visions
 
false prophet zedekiah, saith micaiah (1 kings 22.24.) "which way
 went spirit lord speak thee?" be
 understood ghost; micaiah declared kings israel
 judah, event battle, vision, a
 spirit, speaking him.
 
manner appeareth, books prophets, that
 though spake spirit god, say, speciall
 grace prediction; yet knowledge future, a
 ghost within them, supernaturall dream vision.
 



fiftly, life
 
gen. 2.7. said, "god made man dust earth, and
 breathed nostrills (spiraculum vitae) breath life, and
 man made living soul." breath life inspired god,
 signifies more, god gave life; (job 27.3.) "as long
 spirit god nostrils;" say, "as
 long live." ezek. 1.20. "the spirit life the
 wheels," equivalent to, "the wheels alive." (ezek. 2.30.)
 "the spirit entred me, set feet," is, "i
 recovered vitall strength;" ghost, incorporeal
 substance entred into, possessed body.
 



sixtly, subordination authority
 
11 chap. numbers. verse 17. "i will take (saith god) the
 spirit, upon thee, will put upon them, shall
 bear burthen people thee;" is, upon seventy
 elders: whereupon two seventy said prophecy campe;
 complained, joshua desired moses forbid them; which
 moses doe. whereby appears; joshua knew had
 received authority do, prophecyed according mind of
 moses, say, spirit, authority subordinate own.
 
like sense read (deut. 34.9.) "joshua full the
 spirit wisdome," moses laid hands upon him: is,
 ordained moses, prosecute work hee himselfe
 begun, (namely, bringing gods people promised land), but
 prevented death, finish.
 
like sense said, (rom. 8.9.) "if man the
 spirit christ, none his:" meaning thereby ghost of
 christ, submission doctrine. also (1 john 4.2.) "hereby
 shall know spirit god; every spirit confesseth that
 jesus christ come flesh, god;" meant the
 spirit unfained christianity, submission main article of
 christian faith, jesus christ; interpreted
 ghost.
 
likewise words (luke 4.1.) "and jesus full holy ghost"
 (that is, exprest, mat. 4.1. mar. 1.12. "of holy
 spirit",) may understood, zeal doe work hee was
 sent god father: interpret ghost, say, that
 god himselfe (for saviour was,) filled god; is
 unproper, unsignificant. came translate spirits, by
 word ghosts, signifieth nothing, neither heaven, earth,
 imaginary inhabitants mans brain, examine not: i
 say, word spirit text signifieth thing; either
 properly reall substance, metaphorically, extraordinary
 ability affection mind, body.
 



seventhly, aeriall bodies
 
disciples christ, seeing walking upon sea, (mat. 14.26.
 marke 6.49.) supposed spirit, meaning thereby aeriall
 body, phantasme: said, saw him; which
 understood delusions brain, (which not
 common many once, visible bodies are; singular, of
 differences fancies), bodies only. like manner, where
 taken spirit, apostles (luke 24.3,7.): also
 (acts 12.15) st. peter delivered prison, not
 beleeved; maid said dore, said it
 angel; must meant corporeall substance, must
 say, disciples follow common opinion jews
 gentiles, apparitions imaginary, reall;
 needed fancy man existence: the
 jews called spirits, angels, good bad; greeks called the
 name daemons. apparitions may reall, and
 substantiall; say, subtile bodies, god can form by
 power, formed things, make use of, of
 ministers, messengers (that say, angels) declare his
 will, execute pleaseth, extraordinary and
 supernaturall manner. hee hath formed are
 substances, endued dimensions, take roome, can moved
 place place, peculiar bodies; therefore not
 ghosts incorporeall, say, ghosts place;
 say, where; say, seeming be
 somewhat, nothing. corporeall taken vulgar
 manner, substances perceptible externall senses;
 substance incorporeall, thing imaginary, reall;
 namely, thin substance invisible, hath dimensions
 grosser bodies.
 



angel what
 
name angel, signified generally, messenger; most
 often, messenger god: messenger god, signified, any
 thing makes known extraordinary presence; say, the
 extraordinary manifestation power, especially dream, or
 vision.
 
concerning creation angels, nothing delivered the
 scriptures. spirits, often repeated: name of
 spirit, signified scripture, vulgarly, amongst jews,
 gentiles, sometimes thin bodies; aire, wind, spirits
 vitall, animall, living creatures; sometimes images
 rise fancy dreams, visions; reall
 substances, accidents brain; yet god raiseth them
 supernaturally, signifie will, unproperly termed
 gods messengers, say, angels.
 
gentiles vulgarly conceive imagery brain, for
 things really subsistent without them, dependent fancy;
 framed opinions daemons, good evill; which
 seemed subsist really, called substances; and
 feel hands, incorporeall: also
 jews upon ground, without thing old testament
 constrained thereunto, generally opinion, (except the
 sect sadduces,) apparitions (which pleased god
 sometimes produce fancie men, service, and
 therefore called angels) substances, dependent the
 fancy, permanent creatures god; whereof thought
 good them, esteemed angels god, they
 thought hurt them, called evill angels, evill spirits;
 spirit python, spirits mad-men, of
 lunatiques, epileptiques: esteemed troubled
 diseases, daemoniaques.
 
consider places old testament angels are
 mentioned, shall find, them, can nothing else
 understood word angel, image raised (supernaturally)
 fancy, signifie presence god execution some
 supernaturall work; therefore rest, nature not
 exprest, may understood manner.
 
read gen. 16. apparition called, onely an
 angel, god; (verse 7.) called angel of
 lord, tenth verse, saith agar, "i will multiply thy seed
 exceedingly;" is, speaketh person god. neither this
 apparition fancy figured, voice. manifest,
 angel signifieth there, nothing god himself, caused agar
 supernaturally apprehend voice supernaturall, testifying gods
 speciall presence there. therefore may angels appeared
 lot, called gen. 19.13. men; whom, though were
 two, lot speaketh (ver. 18.) one, one, god, (for
 words are, "lot said unto them, oh lord") understood of
 images men, supernaturally formed fancy; well by
 angel understood fancyed voice? angel called abraham
 heaven, stay hand (gen. 22.11.) slaying isaac, there
 apparition, voice; neverthelesse called properly
 enough messenger, angel god, declared gods will
 supernaturally, saves labour supposing permanent ghosts.
 angels jacob saw ladder heaven (gen. 28.12.) were
 vision sleep; therefore onely fancy, dream; yet being
 supernaturall, signs gods speciall presence, apparitions
 improperly called angels. understood
 (gen.31.11.) jacob saith thus, "the angel lord appeared to
 mee sleep." apparition made man sleep, is
 men call dreame, whether dreame naturall, or
 supernaturall: jacob calleth angel, god
 himselfe; angel saith (verse 13.) "i god bethel."
 
also (exod.14.9.) angel went army israel the
 red sea, came behind it, (verse 19.) lord himself; and
 appeared form beautifull man, form (by day)
 pillar cloud (by night) form pillar fire; yet
 pillar apparition, angel promised moses (exod.
 14.9.) armies guide: cloudy pillar, said, have
 descended, stood dore tabernacle, talked
 moses.
 
see motion, speech, commonly attributed to
 angels, attributed cloud, cloud served sign of
 gods presence; lesse angel, form of
 man, child never great beauty; wings, usually are
 painted, false instruction common people. the
 shape; use, makes angels. use be
 significations gods presence supernaturall operations; when
 moses (exod. 33.14.) desired god goe along campe, (as
 done alwaies making golden calfe,) god not
 answer, "i will goe," "i will send angel stead;" thus,
 "my presence shall goe thee."
 
mention places old testament name angel
 found, long. therefore comprehend once,
 say, text part old testament, the
 church england holdeth canonicall, can conclude,
 is, hath created, permanent thing (understood the
 name spirit angel,) hath quantity; may be,
 understanding divided; say, considered parts; so
 one part may bee one place, next part next place
 it; and, summe, (taking body that, some
 what, where) corporeall; every place, sense will bear
 interpretation angel, messenger; john baptist called
 angel, christ angel covenant; (according the
 analogy) dove, fiery tongues, signes
 gods speciall presence, might also called angels. though find
 daniel two names angels, gabriel, michael; yet cleer of
 text selfe, (dan. 12.1) michael meant christ, as
 angel, prince: gabriel (as like apparitions
 made holy men sleep) nothing supernaturall
 phantasme, seemed daniel, dream, two saints
 talke, one said other, "gabriel, let us make
 man understand vision:" god needeth not, distinguish
 celestiall servants names, usefull onely short
 memories mortalls. new testament place, out
 can proved, angels (except put for
 men, god hath made messengers, ministers word,
 works) things permanent, withall incorporeall. they
 permanent, may bee gathered words saviour himselfe,
 (mat. 25.41.) saith, shall said wicked last
 day, "go ye cursed everlasting fire prepared devil his
 angels:" place manifest permanence evill angels,
 (unlesse wee might think name devill angels may be
 understood churches adversaries ministers;) then
 repugnant immateriality; everlasting fire no
 punishment impatible substances, things incorporeall.
 angels therefore thence proved incorporeall. like
 manner st. paul sayes (1 cor. 6.3.) "knew ye wee shall
 judge angels?" (2 pet. 2.4.) "for god spared angels
 sinned, cast hell." (jude 1,6.) "and the
 angels kept first estate, left owne habitation,
 hee hath reserved everlasting chaines darknesse unto the
 judgement last day;" though prove permanence angelicall
 nature, confirmeth also materiality. (mat. 22.30.) the
 resurrection men doe neither marry, give marriage, as
 angels god heaven:" resurrection men shall be
 permanent, incorporeall; therefore also angels.
 
divers places may drawn like
 conclusion. men understand signification words,
 substance, incorporeall; incorporeall taken subtile
 body, body, imply contradiction: insomuch say,
 angel, spirit (in sense) incorporeall substance, is
 say effect, angel spirit all. considering
 therefore signification word angel old testament, and
 nature dreams visions happen men ordinary way
 nature; enclined opinion, angels nothing
 supernaturall apparitions fancy, raised speciall
 extraordinary operation god, thereby make presence and
 commandements known mankind, chiefly people. the
 many places new testament, saviours words, in
 texts, wherein suspicion corruption scripture, have
 extorted feeble reason, acknowledgement, beleef, that
 also angels substantiall, permanent. beleeve be
 place, say, where, say, nothing, they
 (though indirectly) say, will incorporeall, by
 scripture bee evinced.
 



inspiration what
 
signification word spirit, dependeth word
 inspiration; must either taken properly; nothing
 blowing man thin subtile aire, wind, such
 manner man filleth bladder breath; spirits not
 corporeal, existence fancy, nothing but
 blowing phantasme; improper say, impossible;
 phantasmes not, seem somewhat. word
 therefore used scripture metaphorically onely: (gen. 2.7.)
 said, god inspired man breath life, more
 meant, god gave unto vitall motion. to
 think god made first living breath, blew adam
 made, whether breath reall, seeming; only
 (acts 17.25.) "that gave life breath;" is,
 made living creature. said (2 tim. 3.16.) "all
 scripture given inspiration god," speaking the
 scripture old testament, easie metaphor, signifie,
 god enclined spirit mind writers, write that
 usefull, teaching, reproving, correcting, and
 instructing men way righteous living. st. peter (2
 pet. 1.21.) saith, "prophecy came old time will
 man, holy men god spake moved holy
 spirit," holy spirit, meant voice god dream, or
 vision supernaturall, inspiration; saviour
 breathing disciples, said, "receive holy spirit," that
 breath spirit, sign spirituall graces gave unto
 them. though said many, saviour himself, he
 full holy spirit; yet fulnesse understood
 infusion substance god, accumulation gifts,
 gift sanctity life, tongues, like,
 whether attained supernaturally, study industry; all
 cases gifts god. likewise god sayes (joel
 2.28.) "i will powre spirit upon flesh, sons and
 daughters shall prophecy, old men shall dream dreams, your
 young men shall see visions," wee understand the
 proper sense, spirit like water, subject effusion, or
 infusion; god promised give propheticall dreams,
 visions. proper use word infused, speaking of
 graces god, abuse it; graces vertues, not
 bodies carryed hither thither, powred men, as
 barrels.
 
manner, take inspiration proper sense, to
 say good spirits entred men make prophecy, evill
 spirits became phrenetique, lunatique, epileptique,
 take word sense scripture; spirit
 taken power god, working causes us unknown. as
 also (acts 2.2.) wind, said fill house wherein
 apostles assembled day pentecost, be
 understood holy spirit, deity self; an
 externall sign gods speciall working hearts, effect in
 internall graces, holy vertues hee thought requisite for
 performance apostleship.
 



chapter xxxv. signification scripture kingdome god, of
 holy, sacred, sacrament
 

kingdom god taken divines metaphorically scriptures
 properly
 
kingdome god writings divines, specially in
 sermons, treatises devotion, taken commonly eternall
 felicity, life, highest heaven, also call
 kingdome glory; sometimes (the earnest felicity)
 sanctification, terme kingdome grace, never
 monarchy, say, soveraign power god over
 subjects acquired consent, proper
 signification kingdome.
 
contrary, find kingdome god, signifie places
 scripture, kingdome properly named, constituted votes
 people israel peculiar manner; wherein chose god
 king covenant made him, upon gods promising the
 possession land canaan; seldom metaphorically;
 taken dominion sinne; (and new
 testament;) dominion that, every subject shall in
 kingdome god, without prejudice soveraign.
 
creation, god reigned men naturally by
 might; also peculiar subjects, commanded voice,
 one man speaketh another. manner reigned adam,
 gave commandement abstaine tree cognizance of
 good evill; obeyed not, tasting thereof, took upon
 god, judging good evill, creators
 commandement, sense, punishment privation of
 estate eternall life, wherein god first created him: and
 afterwards god punished posterity, vices, eight
 persons, universall deluge; eight consist the
 kingdome god.
 



originall kingdome god
 
this, pleased god speak abraham, (gen. 17.7,8.) to
 make covenant words, "i will establish covenant
 me, thee, thy seed thee generations,
 everlasting covenant, god thee, thy seed after
 thee; will give unto thee, thy seed thee, land
 wherein thou art stranger, land canaan everlasting
 possession." memoriall, token covenant, he
 ordaineth (verse 11.) sacrament circumcision. is
 called old covenant, testament; containeth contract between
 god abraham; abraham obligeth himself, posterity,
 peculiar manner subject gods positive law; law
 morall obliged before, oath allegiance. though
 name king yet given god, kingdome abraham and
 seed; yet thing same; namely, institution pact,
 gods peculiar soveraignty seed abraham; the
 renewing covenant moses, mount sinai, expressely
 called peculiar kingdome god jews: abraham
 (not moses) st. paul saith (rom. 4.11.) "father the
 faithfull," is, loyall, doe violate their
 allegiance sworn god, circumcision, afterwards new
 covenant baptisme.
 



kingdome god properly civill soveraignty a
 peculiar people pact
 
covenant, foot mount sinai, renewed moses (exod.
 19.5.) lord commandeth moses speak people this
 manner, "if will obey voice indeed, keep covenant, then
 yee shall peculiar people me, earth mine; and
 yee shall unto sacerdotall kingdome, holy nation." a
 "peculiar people" vulgar latine hath, peculium cunctis populis:
 english translation made beginning reign king
 james, hath, "peculiar treasure unto nations;" the
 geneva french, "the precious jewel nations." truest
 translation first, confirmed st. paul himself
 (tit. 2.14.) saith, alluding place, blessed
 saviour "gave us, might purifie us himself, a
 peculiar (that is, extraordinary) people:" word the
 greek periousios, opposed commonly word epiousios: and
 signifieth ordinary, quotidian, (as lords prayer) of
 daily use; signifieth overplus, stored
 up, enjoyed speciall manner; latines call peculium;
 meaning place confirmed reason god rendereth
 it, followeth immediately, addeth, "for the
 earth mine," say, "all nations world are
 mine;" mine, speciall manner: for
 mine, reason power; shall mine, your
 consent, covenant; addition ordinary title,
 nations.
 
confirmed expresse words text, "yee
 shall sacerdotall kingdome, holy nation." vulgar
 latine hath it, regnum sacerdotale, agreeth translation of
 place (1 pet. 2.9.) sacerdotium regale, regal priesthood; also
 institution self, man might enter sanctum
 sanctorum, say, man might enquire gods will immediately of
 god himselfe, onely high priest. english translation before
 mentioned, following geneva, has, "a kingdome priests;" which
 either meant succession one high priest another, or
 else accordeth st. peter, exercise high
 priesthood; never high priest onely, was
 informe people gods will; convocation priests ever
 allowed enter sanctum sanctorum.
 
again, title holy nation confirmes same: holy
 signifies, gods speciall, generall right. all
 earth (as said text) gods; earth is
 called holy, onely set apart especiall
 service, nation jews. therefore manifest enough
 one place, kingdome god, properly meant a
 common-wealth, instituted (by consent be
 subject thereto) civill government, regulating of
 behaviour, onely towards god king, also towards one
 another point justice, towards nations peace and
 warre; properly kingdome, wherein god king, the
 high priest (after death moses) sole viceroy, or
 lieutenant.
 
many places clearly prove same. first (1
 sam. 8.7.) elders israel (grieved corruption of
 sons samuel) demanded king, samuel displeased therewith, prayed
 unto lord; lord answering said unto him, "hearken unto the
 voice people, rejected thee, have
 rejected me, reign them." is
 evident, god king; samuel not
 command people, delivered god time
 time appointed him.
 
again, (1 sam. 12.12.) samuel saith people, "when yee saw
 nahash king children ammon came you, ye said unto
 me, nay, king shall reign us, lord god your
 king:" manifest god king, governed civill
 state common-wealth.
 
israelites rejected god, prophets foretell his
 restitution; (isaiah 24.23.) "then moon shall confounded, and
 sun ashamed lord hosts shall reign mount zion, and
 jerusalem;" speaketh expressely reign zion, and
 jerusalem; is, earth. (micah 4.7.) "and lord shall
 reign mount zion:" mount zion jerusalem upon the
 earth. (ezek. 20.33.) "as live, saith lord god, surely a
 mighty hand, stretched arme, fury powred out, wil
 rule you; (verse 37.) will cause passe rod,
 will bring bond covenant;" is, will
 reign you, make stand covenant made
 moses, brake rebellion days of
 samuel, election another king.
 
new testament, angel gabriel saith saviour (luke
 1.32,33) "he shall great, called high,
 lord shall give throne father david; shall
 reign house jacob ever; kingdome shall
 end." also kingdome upon earth; claim whereof,
 enemy caesar, put death; title crosse,
 was, jesus nazareth, king jews; hee crowned scorn with
 crown thornes; proclaiming him, said of
 disciples (acts 17.7.) "that contrary to
 decrees caesar, saying another king, one jesus. the
 kingdome therefore god, reall, metaphoricall kingdome; and
 taken, onely old testament, new; say, "for
 thine kingdome, power, glory," understood of
 gods kingdome, force covenant, right gods power;
 kingdome god alwaies hath; superfluous to
 say prayer, "thy kingdome come," unlesse meant the
 restauration kingdome god christ, revolt the
 israelites interrupted election saul. been
 proper say, "the kingdome heaven hand," pray, "thy
 kingdome come," still continued.
 
many places confirm interpretation, it
 wonder greater notice taken it, gives
 much light christian kings see right ecclesiastical
 government. observed, stead sacerdotall
 kingdome, translate, kingdome priests: may well
 translate royall priesthood, (as st. peter) priesthood
 kings. whereas, peculiar people, put pretious jewel,
 treasure, man might well call speciall regiment, company
 generall, generalls pretious jewel, treasure.
 
short, kingdome god civill kingdome; consisted,
 first obligation people israel laws, which
 moses bring unto mount sinai; afterwards the
 high priest time being, deliver the
 cherubins sanctum sanctorum; kingdome cast
 off, election saul, prophets foretold, restored
 christ; restauration whereof daily pray for, we
 say lords prayer, "thy kingdome come;" right whereof we
 acknowledge, adde, "for thine kingdome, power, and
 glory, ever ever, amen;" proclaiming whereof, was
 preaching apostles; men prepared, the
 teachers gospel; embrace gospel, (that say, to
 promise obedience gods government) is, bee kingdome of
 grace, god hath gratis given power bee the
 subjects (that is, children) god hereafter, christ shall come
 majesty judge world, actually govern owne people,
 called kingdome glory. kingdome god (called
 also kingdome heaven, gloriousnesse, admirable
 height throne) kingdome god lieutenant,
 vicars, deliver commandements people, exercise on
 earth; much contention, warre, about
 is, god speaketh us; neither many priests have
 troubled spirituall jurisdiction, king have
 denied them.
 
literall interpretation kingdome god, ariseth also
 true interpretation word holy. word, in
 gods kingdome answereth that, men kingdomes use to
 call publique, kings.
 
king countrey publique person, representative of
 subjects. god king israel holy one of
 israel. nation subject one earthly soveraign, the
 nation soveraign, is, publique person. jews,
 gods nation, called (exod. 19.6.) "a holy nation." by
 holy, alwaies understood, either god himselfe, gods
 propriety; publique alwaies meant, either person the
 common-wealth self, something common-wealths, no
 private person can claim propriety therein.
 
therefore sabbath (gods day) holy day; temple, (gods house)
 holy house; sacrifices, tithes, offerings (gods tribute) holy
 duties; priests, prophets, anointed kings, christ (gods
 ministers) holy men; coelestiall ministring spirits (gods
 messengers) holy angels; like: wheresoever word holy is
 taken properly, still something signified propriety, gotten
 consent. saying "hallowed thy name," pray god for
 grace keep first commandement, "having gods but
 him." mankind gods nation propriety: jews holy
 nation. why, became propriety covenant.
 



sacred what
 
word profane, usually taken scripture same
 common; consequently contraries, holy, proper, the
 kingdome god must also. figuratively, men also
 called holy, led godly lives, forsaken all
 worldly designes, wholly devoted, given god.
 proper sense, made holy gods appropriating or
 separating use, said sanctified god, the
 seventh day fourth commandement; elect new
 testament said bee sanctified, endued the
 spirit godlinesse. made holy dedication of
 men, given god, used onely publique service,
 called also sacred, said consecrated, temples, other
 houses publique prayer, utensils, priests, ministers,
 victimes, offerings, externall matter sacraments.
 



degrees sanctity
 
holinesse degrees: things set apart
 service god, may bee set apart again, neerer
 especial service. whole nation israelites a
 people holy god; yet tribe levi amongst israelites a
 holy tribe; amongst levites, priests yet holy; and
 amongst priests, high priest holy. land
 judea holy land; holy city wherein god be
 worshipped, holy; again, temples holy the
 city; sanctum sanctorum holy rest temple.
 



sacrament
 
sacrament, separation visible thing common use;
 consecration gods service, sign, either our
 admission kingdome god, number peculiar
 people, commemoration same. old testament, the
 sign admission circumcision; new testament, baptisme. the
 commemoration old testament, eating (at certain
 time, anniversary) paschall lamb; were
 put mind night wherein delivered their
 bondage egypt; new testament, celebrating the
 lords supper; which, put mind, deliverance from
 bondage sin, blessed saviours death upon crosse. the
 sacraments admission, used, needs
 one admission; need often put in
 mind deliverance, allegeance, sacraments of
 commemoration need reiterated. principall
 sacraments, solemne oathes make our
 alleageance. also consecrations, may called
 sacraments, word implyeth onely consecration gods service; but
 implies oath, promise alleageance god, no
 old testament, circumcision, passover; nor
 new testament, baptisme, lords
 supper.
 


chapter xxxvi. word god, prophets
 



word what
 
mention word god, man, doth not
 signifie part speech, grammarians call nown, verb,
 simple voice, without contexture words make it
 significative; perfect speech discourse, whereby speaker
 affirmeth, denieth, commandeth, promiseth, threateneth, wisheth, or
 interrogateth. sense vocabulum, signifies a
 word; sermo, (in greek logos) speech, discourse, or
 saying.
 



words spoken god concerning god, called gods word
 scripture
 
again, say word god, man, may bee understood
 sometimes speaker, (as words god hath spoken, that
 man hath spoken): sense, say, gospel st.
 matthew, understand st. matthew writer it: sometimes
 subject: sense, read bible, "the words
 days kings israel, judah," ’tis meant, acts
 done days, subject words; in
 greek, (in scripture) retaineth many hebraismes, the
 word god oftentimes meant, spoken god, but
 concerning god, government; say, doctrine of
 religion: insomuch, one, say logos theou, theologia;
 is, doctrine wee usually call divinity, manifest
 places following (acts 13.46.) "then paul barnabas waxed
 bold, said, necessary word god first
 spoken you, seeing put you, judge your
 selves unworthy everlasting life, loe, turn gentiles."
 called word god, doctrine christian
 religion; appears evidently goes before. (acts
 5.20.) said apostles angel, "go stand speak
 temple, words life;" words life,
 meant, doctrine gospel; evident in
 temple, expressed last verse chap. "daily
 temple, every house ceased teach preach
 christ jesus:" place manifest, jesus christ the
 subject word life; (which one) subject the
 words life eternall, saviour offered them. (acts
 15.7.) word god, called word gospel, it
 containeth doctrine kingdome christ; word
 (rom. 10.8,9.) called word faith; is, there
 expressed, doctrine christ come, raised dead. also
 (mat. 13. 19.) "when one heareth word kingdome;" is,
 doctrine kingdome taught christ. again, word, is
 said (acts 12. 24.) "to grow multiplied;" understand
 evangelicall doctrine easie, voice, speech
 god, hard strange. sense doctrine devils,
 signifieth words devill, doctrine heathen men
 concerning daemons, phantasms worshipped gods.
 (1 tim. 4.1.)
 
considering two significations word god, taken
 scripture, manifest later sense (where taken for
 doctrine christian religion,) whole scripture the
 word god: former sense so. example, though these
 words, "i lord thy god, &c." end ten commandements,
 spoken god moses; yet preface, "god spake words
 said," understood words wrote holy
 history. word god, taken hath spoken,
 understood sometimes properly, sometimes metaphorically. properly,
 words, hath spoken prophets; metaphorically, his
 wisdome, power, eternall decree, making world; which
 sense, fiats, "let light," "let firmament,"
 "let us make man," &c. (gen. 1.) word god. same
 sense said (john 1.3.) "all things made it, without it
 nothing made made; (heb. 1.3.) "he upholdeth things
 word power;" is, power word; is,
 power; (heb. 11.3.) "the worlds framed word
 god;" many places sense: also amongst the
 latines, name fate, signifieth properly word spoken, is
 taken sense.
 



secondly, effect word
 
secondly, effect word; say, thing it
 self, word affirmed, commanded, threatned, promised;
 (psalm 105.19.) joseph said kept prison,
 "till word come;" is, till come passe which
 (gen. 40.13.) foretold pharaohs butler, concerning being
 restored office: word come, meant, the
 thing self come passe. also (1 king. 18.36.) elijah saith
 god, "i done thy words," stead "i done all
 things thy word," commandement: (jer. 17.15.) "where is
 word lord," put for, "where evill threatened:"
 (ezek. 12.28.) "there shall none words prolonged any
 more:" "words" understood things, god promised his
 people. new testament (mat. 24.35.) "heaven earth shal
 pass away, words shall pass away;" is, nothing
 promised foretold, shall come passe. in
 sense is, st. john evangelist, and, think, st. john
 onely calleth saviour flesh "the word god
 (as joh. 1.14.) word made flesh;" say, word, or
 promise christ come world, "who beginning
 god;" say, purpose god father,
 send god world, enlighten men way of
 eternall life, till put execution, actually
 incarnate; saviour called "the word," because
 promise, thing promised. taking occasion
 place, doe commonly call verbe god, render
 text obscure. might well term nown god:
 nown, also verbe, men understand nothing part
 speech, voice, sound, neither affirms, denies, nor
 commands, promiseth, substance corporeall, spirituall;
 therefore said bee either god, man; whereas our
 saviour both. word st. john gospel saith was
 god, (in 1 epistle, verse 1.) called "the word life;" and
 (verse 2.) "the eternall life, father:" he
 can sense called word, that, wherein is
 called eternall life; is, "he hath procured us eternall life,"
 comming flesh. also (apocalypse 19.13.) apostle
 speaking christ, clothed garment dipt bloud, saith; name
 "the word god;" understood, said his
 name been, "he come according purpose god from
 beginning, according word promises delivered the
 prophets." nothing incarnation word,
 incarnation god son, therefore called word,
 incarnation performance promise; like
 manner holy ghost called promise. (acts 1.4. luke 24.49.)
 



thirdly, words reason equity
 
also places scripture, where, word god, is
 signified words consonant reason, equity, though
 spoken sometimes neither prophet, holy man. pharaoh
 necho idolator; yet words good king josiah, which
 advised messengers, oppose march against
 carchemish, said proceeded mouth god; that
 josiah hearkning them, slain battle; read
 2 chron. 35. vers. 21,22,23. true, history is
 related first book esdras, pharaoh, jeremiah spake
 words josiah, mouth lord. wee to
 give credit canonicall scripture, whatsoever written the
 apocrypha.
 
word god, also taken dictates reason,
 equity, said scriptures bee written in
 mans heart; psalm 36.31. jerem. 31.33. deut.30.11, 14. many other
 like places.
 



divers acceptions word prophet
 
name prophet, signifieth scripture sometimes prolocutor; that
 is, speaketh god man, man god: sometimes
 praedictor, foreteller things come; sometimes one that
 speaketh incoherently, men distracted. frequently
 used sense speaking god people. moses, samuel,
 elijah, isaiah, jeremiah, others prophets. sense
 high priest prophet, went sanctum
 sanctorum, enquire god; declare answer the
 people. therefore caiphas said, expedient one man
 die people, st. john saith (chap. 11.51.) "he spake
 himselfe, high priest year, prophesied
 one man dye nation." also christian
 congregations taught people, (1 cor. 14.3.) said prophecy. in
 like sense is, god saith moses (exod. 4.16.) concerning
 aaron, "he shall thy spokes-man people; shall to
 thee mouth, thou shalt stead god;" here
 spokesman, (chap.7.1.) interpreted prophet; "see (saith god)
 made thee god pharaoh, aaron thy brother shall thy
 prophet." sense speaking man god, abraham called
 prophet (genes. 20.7.) god dream speaketh abimelech
 manner, "now therefore restore man wife, a
 prophet, shall pray thee;" whereby may also gathered,
 name prophet may given, unproperly that
 christian churches, calling say publique prayers the
 congregation. sense, prophets came the
 high place (or hill god) psaltery, tabret, pipe,
 harp (1 sam. 10.5,6.) (vers. 10.) saul amongst them, said
 prophecy, praised god, manner publiquely. the
 like sense, miriam (exod. 15.20.) called prophetesse. it
 also taken (1 cor. 11.4,5.) st. paul saith, "every man that
 prayeth prophecyeth head covered, &c. every woman that
 prayeth prophecyeth head uncovered: prophecy that
 place, signifieth more, praising god psalmes, holy songs;
 women might doe church, though lawfull them
 speak congregation. signification is, the
 poets heathen, composed hymnes sorts poems in
 honor gods, called vates (prophets) well enough
 known versed books gentiles, as
 evident (tit. 1.12.) st. paul saith cretians, a
 prophet owne said, liars; st. paul held
 poets prophets, acknowledgeth word prophet was
 commonly used signifie celebrated honour god in
 verse
 



praediction future contingents, alwaies prophecy
 
prophecy meant praediction, foretelling future
 contingents; prophets, gods spokesmen, and
 foretold things others, god foretold them; but
 also imposters, pretend helpe familiar spirits,
 superstitious divination events past, false causes, to
 foretell like events time come: (as declared
 already 12. chapter discourse) many kinds, who
 gain opinion common sort men, greater reputation
 prophecy, one casuall event may bee wrested their
 purpose, can lost never many failings. prophecy is
 art, (when taken praediction) constant vocation;
 extraordinary, temporary employment god, often of
 good men, sometimes also wicked. woman endor, who
 said familiar spirit, thereby raised a
 phantasme samuel, foretold saul death, therefore a
 prophetesse; neither science, whereby raise
 phantasme; appear god commanded raising of
 it; onely guided imposture means sauls terror and
 discouragement; consequent, discomfiture, he
 fell. incoherent speech, amongst gentiles taken for
 one sort prophecy, prophets oracles, intoxicated
 spirit, vapour cave pythian oracle delphi,
 time really mad, spake like mad-men; whose loose
 words sense might made fit event, sort, all
 bodies said made materia prima. scripture find
 also taken (1 sam. 18. 10.) words, "and evill spirit
 came upon saul, prophecyed midst house."
 



manner god hath spoken prophets
 
although many significations scripture word
 prophet; yet frequent, taken him,
 god speaketh immediately, prophet say from
 him, man, people. hereupon question may
 asked, manner god speaketh prophet. can (may some
 say) properly said, god hath voice language, cannot
 properly said, hath tongue, organs, man? the
 prophet david argueth thus, "shall made eye, see? he
 made ear, hear?" may spoken, (as usually) to
 signifie gods nature, signifie intention honor him. for
 see, hear, honorable attributes, may given god, to
 declare (as far capacity can conceive) almighty power. but
 taken strict, proper sense, one might argue
 making parts mans body, also use
 have; many uncomely, it
 greatest contumely world ascribe him.
 therefore interpret gods speaking men immediately, that
 way (whatsoever be), god makes understand will: and
 wayes whereby doth this, many; sought onely the
 holy scripture: though many times said, god spake to
 this, person, without declaring manner; yet be
 many places, deliver also signes were
 acknowledge presence, commandement; may be
 understood, spake many rest.
 



extraordinary prophets old testament spake dreams,
 visions
 
manner god spake adam, eve, cain, noah, not
 expressed; spake abraham, till time came of
 countrey sichem land canaan; (gen. 12.7.)
 god said appeared him. one way, whereby god
 made presence manifest; is, apparition, vision. and
 again, (gen. 15.1.) word lord came abraham vision;
 say, somewhat, sign gods presence, appeared gods
 messenger, speak him. again, lord appeared abraham (gen.
 18. 1.) apparition three angels; abimelech (gen. 20. 3.)
 dream: lot (gen. 19. 1.) apparition two angels: and
 hagar (gen. 21. 17.) apparition one angel: abraham
 (gen. 22. 11.) apparition voice heaven: (gen.
 26. 24.) isaac night; (that is, sleep, dream):
 jacob (gen. 18. 12.) dream; say (as words
 text) "jacob dreamed saw ladder, &c." (gen. 32. 1.)
 vision angels: moses (exod. 3.2.) apparition a
 flame fire midst bush: time moses,
 (where manner god spake immediately man old testament,
 expressed) hee spake alwaies vision, dream; to
 gideon, samuel, eliah, elisha, isaiah, ezekiel, rest the
 prophets; often new testament, joseph, st. peter, to
 st. paul, st. john evangelist apocalypse.
 
onely moses hee spake extraordinary manner mount sinai,
 tabernacle; high priest tabernacle, in
 sanctum sanctorum temple. moses, the
 high priests prophets eminent place, degree in
 gods favour; god express words declareth, other
 prophets hee spake dreams visions, servant moses, in
 manner man speaketh friend. words (numb.
 12. 6,7,8.) "if prophet among you, lord will make my
 self known vision, will speak unto dream. my
 servant moses so, faithfull house; i
 will speak mouth mouth, even apparently, dark speeches; and
 similitude lord shall behold." (exod. 33. 11.) "the
 lord spake moses face face, man speaketh friend."
 yet speaking god moses, mediation angel, or
 angels, appears expressely, acts 7. ver. 35. 53. gal. 3. 19.
 therefore vision, though cleer vision given to
 prophets. conformable hereunto, god saith (deut. 13. 1.)
 "if arise amongst prophet, dreamer dreams," later
 word interpretation former. (joel 2. 28.) "your
 sons daughters shall prophecy; old men shall dream dreams,
 young men shall see visions:" again, word prophecy is
 expounded dream, vision. manner was, god
 spake solomon, promising wisdome, riches, honor; text
 saith, (1 kings 3. 15.) "and solomon awoak, behold dream:"
 generally prophets extraordinary old testament took
 notice word god otherwise, dreams, or
 visions, say, imaginations their
 sleep, extasie; imaginations every true prophet were
 supernaturall; false prophets either naturall, feigned.
 
prophets neverthelesse said speak spirit; as
 (zach. 7. 12.) prophet speaking jewes, saith, "they
 made hearths hard adamant, lest hear law, and
 words lord hosts hath sent spirit former
 prophets." manifest, speaking spirit, or
 inspiration, particular manner gods speaking, different
 vision, said speak spirit, were
 extraordinary prophets, every new message, a
 particular commission, (which one) new dream, vision.
 
prophets perpetuall calling, supreme, god spake the
 old testament mercy seat, manner expressed the
 scripture. prophets, perpetuall calling old
 testament, supreme, subordinate: supreme first
 moses; high priest, every one time, long
 priesthood royall; people jews, had
 rejected god, reign them, kings which
 submitted gods government, also chief prophets;
 high priests office became ministeriall. god be
 consulted, put holy vestments, enquired lord,
 king commanded them, deprived office, when
 king thought fit. king saul (1 sam. 13. 9.) commanded burnt
 offering brought, (1 sam. 14. 18.) commands priest to
 bring ark neer him; (ver. 19.) let alone, he
 saw advantage upon enemies. chapter saul asketh
 counsell god. like manner king david, anointed,
 though possession kingdome, said "enquire
 lord" (1 sam. 23. 2.) whether fight the
 philistines keilah; (verse 10.) david commandeth priest to
 bring ephod, enquire whether stay keilah,
 not. king solomon (1 kings 2. 27.) took priesthood from
 abiathar, gave (verse 35.) zadoc. therefore moses, and
 high priests, pious kings, enquired god all
 extraordinary occasions, carry themselves, what
 event have, soveraign prophets. manner
 god spake unto them, manifest. say moses went to
 god mount sinai, dream, vision, prophets
 had, contrary distinction god made moses, and
 prophets, numb. 12. 6,7,8. say god spake appeared he
 nature, deny infinitenesse, invisibility,
 incomprehensibility. say spake inspiration, infusion the
 holy spirit, holy spirit signifieth deity, make moses
 equall christ, onely godhead (as st. paul speaketh col.
 2.9.) dwelleth bodily. lastly, say spake holy spirit,
 signifieth graces, gifts holy spirit, to
 attribute nothing supernaturall. god disposeth men piety,
 justice, mercy, truth, faith, manner vertue, morall,
 intellectuall, doctrine, example, severall occasions,
 naturall, ordinary.
 
ways applyed god, speaking moses, at
 mount sinai; also, applyed him, speaking
 high priests, mercy-seat. therefore manner god
 spake soveraign prophets old testament, whose office
 enquire him, intelligible. time new
 testament, soveraign prophet, saviour; both
 god spake, prophet spake.
 
prophets perpetuall calling, subordinate, god spake the
 spirit. subordinate prophets perpetuall calling, find any
 place proveth god spake supernaturally; onely in
 manner, naturally inclineth men piety, beleef, to
 righteousnesse, vertues christian men. which
 way, though consist constitution, instruction, education, the
 occasions invitements men christian vertues; yet truly
 attributed operation spirit god, holy spirit
 (which language call holy ghost): good
 inclination, operation god. operations
 alwaies supernaturall. therefore prophet said speak
 spirit, spirit god, understand more,
 speaks according gods will, declared supreme
 prophet. common acceptation word spirit, the
 signification mans intention, mind, disposition.
 
time moses, seventy men besides himself, that
 prophecyed campe israelites. manner god spake to
 them, declared 11 numbers, verse 25. "the lord came in
 cloud, spake unto moses, took spirit upon him,
 gave seventy elders. came passe, spirit
 rested upon them, prophecyed, cease," is
 manifest, first, prophecying people, subservient,
 subordinate prophecying moses; god took the
 spirit moses, put upon them; prophecyed moses
 them: otherwise suffered prophecy at
 all. (verse 27.) complaint made moses;
 joshua moses forbidden them; not,
 said joshua, bee jealous behalf. secondly, that
 spirit god place, signifieth nothing mind and
 disposition obey, assist moses administration the
 government. meant substantial spirit god;
 is, divine nature, inspired them, no
 lesse manner christ himself, onely spirit god dwelt
 bodily. meant therefore gift grace god, guided
 co-operate moses; spirit derived. and
 appeareth (verse 16.) that, moses should
 appoint elders officers people: words are,
 "gather unto seventy men, thou knowest elders and
 officers people:" where, "thou knowest," "thou
 appointest," "hast appointed such." told
 (exod. 18.) moses following counsell jethro his
 father-in-law, appoint judges, officers people, as
 feared god; these, seventy, god putting upon
 moses spirit, inclined aid moses administration the
 kingdome: sense spirit god said (1 sam. 16. 13,
 14.) presently upon anointing david, come upon david, and
 left saul; god giving graces chose govern people,
 taking away him, rejected. spirit is
 meant inclination gods service; supernaturall revelation.
 



god sometimes also spake lots
 
god spake also many times event lots; ordered by
 put authority people. wee read god
 manifested lots saul caused drawn (1 sam. 14. 43.)
 fault jonathan committed, eating honey-comb, contrary
 oath taken people. (josh. 18. 10.) god divided the
 land canaan amongst israelite, "lots joshua cast
 lord shiloh." manner seemeth be, that
 god discovered (joshua 7.16., &c.) crime achan. the
 wayes whereby god declared will old testament.
 
ways used also new testament. virgin mary, by
 vision angel: joseph dream: paul way
 damascus vision saviour: peter vision of
 sheet let heaven, divers sorts flesh, clean and
 unclean, beasts; prison, vision angel: the
 apostles, writers new testament, graces spirit;
 apostles (at choosing matthias place of
 judas iscariot) lot.
 



every man examine probability pretended prophets
 calling
 
seeing prophecy supposeth vision, dream, (which two, when
 naturall, same,) especiall gift god, so
 rarely observed mankind, admired observed; seeing
 well gifts, extraordinary dreams, visions, may
 proceed god, onely supernaturall, immediate, but
 also naturall operation, mediation second causes;
 need reason judgement discern naturall, and
 supernaturall gifts, naturall, supernaturall visions, or
 dreams. consequently men need circumspect, wary,
 obeying voice man, pretending prophet,
 requires us obey god way, gods name telleth us to
 way happinesse. pretends teach men way of
 great felicity, pretends govern them; say, rule, and
 reign them; thing, men naturally desire, and
 therefore worthy suspected ambition imposture; and
 consequently, examined, tryed every man, hee
 yeeld obedience; unlesse yeelded already, in
 institution common-wealth; prophet civill
 soveraign, civil soveraign authorized. examination
 prophets, spirits, allowed every one people,
 purpose, set marks, every man
 might able, distinguish those, ought, those
 follow. seeing therefore marks set out
 (deut. 13. 1,&c.) know prophet by; (1 john 4.1.&c) know a
 spirit by: seeing much prophecying old testament;
 much preaching new testament prophets; much
 greater number ordinarily false prophets, true; every
 one beware obeying directions, perill. and
 first, many false true prophets, appears by
 this, ahab (1 kings 12.) consulted four hundred prophets, they
 false imposters, onely one michaiah. little before
 time captivity, prophets generally lyars. "the
 prophets" (saith lord jerem. cha. 14. verse 14.) "prophecy lies
 name. sent not, neither commanded them, spake
 unto them, prophecy false vision, thing naught; and
 deceit heart." much god commanded people by
 mouth prophet jeremiah (chap. 23. 16.) obey them.
 "thus saith lord hosts, hearken unto words the
 prophets, prophecy you. make vain, speak vision
 heart, mouth lord."
 



prophecy soveraign prophet examined every
 subject
 
seeing time old testament, quarrells
 amongst visionary prophets, one contesting another, asking
 departed spirit me, go thee? michaiah,
 rest four hundred; giving lye one
 another, (as jerem. 14.14.) controversies new
 testament day, amongst spirituall prophets: every man then
 was, now bound make use naturall reason, apply to
 prophecy rules god hath given us, discern the
 true false. rules, old testament, one was,
 conformable doctrine moses soveraign prophet had
 taught them; miraculous power foretelling god
 bring passe, already shown deut. 13. 1. &c.
 new testament one onely mark; the
 preaching doctrine, jesus christ, is, the
 king jews, promised old testament. whosoever denyed that
 article, false prophet, whatsoever miracles might seem to
 work; taught true prophet. st. john (1 epist,
 4. 2, &c) speaking expressely means examine spirits, whether
 god, not; hath told arise
 false prophets, saith thus, "hereby know ye spirit god. every
 spirit confesseth jesus christ come flesh, of
 god;" is, approved allowed prophet god: that
 godly man, one elect, this, confesseth,
 professeth, preacheth jesus christ; a
 prophet avowed. god sometimes speaketh prophets, whose persons he
 hath accepted; baalam; foretold saul his
 death, witch endor. next verse, "every spirit
 confesseth jesus christ come flesh, not
 christ. spirit antichrist." rule is
 perfect sides; true prophet, preacheth the
 messiah already come, person jesus; false one that
 denyeth come, looketh future imposter, that
 shall take upon honour falsely, apostle properly
 calleth antichrist. every man therefore consider the
 soveraign prophet; say, is, gods viceregent
 earth; hath next god, authority governing christian
 men; observe rule, doctrine, name of
 god, hee commanded bee taught; thereby examine try out
 truth doctrines, pretended prophets miracles, or
 without, shall time advance: find contrary that
 rule, doe did, came moses, complained there
 prophecyed campe, whose authority doe they
 doubted of; leave soveraign, moses uphold,
 forbid them, hee see cause; hee disavow them,
 obey voice; approve them, obey
 them, men god hath given part spirit their
 soveraigne. christian men, take christian soveraign,
 gods prophet; must either take owne dreams, the
 prophecy mean bee governed by, tumour own
 hearts spirit god; must suffer bee lead
 strange prince; fellow subjects, can
 bewitch them, slander government, rebellion, without
 miracle confirm calling, sometimes extraordinary
 successe, impunity; means destroying laws, both
 divine, humane, reduce order, government, society, the
 first chaos violence, civill warre.
 


chapter xxxvii. miracles, use
 



miracle work causeth admiration
 
miracles signified admirable works god: & therefore they
 also called wonders. part, done,
 signification commandement, occasions, as
 without them, men apt doubt, (following private naturall
 reasoning,) hath commanded, not, commonly in
 holy scripture, called signes, sense, called by
 latines, ostenta, portenta, shewing, fore-signifying
 that, almighty bring passe.
 



must therefore rare, whereof naturall cause known
 
understand therefore miracle, must first understand what
 works are, men wonder at, call admirable. be
 two things make men wonder event: one is, it
 strange, say, such, like hath never, very
 rarely produced: is, produced, cannot
 imagine done naturall means, onely the
 immediate hand god. wee see possible, naturall cause of
 it, rarely soever like done; like been
 often done, impossible soever imagine naturall means
 thereof, wonder, esteem miracle.
 
therefore, horse, cow speak, miracle; because
 thing strange, & naturall cause difficult imagin: so
 also it, see strange deviation nature, production
 new shape living creature. man, animal,
 engenders like, though know done, the
 other; yet ’tis usuall, miracle. like manner, a
 man metamorphosed stone, pillar, miracle;
 strange: peece wood changed; see it
 often, miracle: yet know more, operation of
 god, one brought passe, other.
 
first rainbow seen world, miracle, the
 first; consequently strange; served sign god, placed
 heaven, assure people, universall
 destruction world water. day, they
 frequent, miracles, neither know their
 naturall causes, know not. again, many
 rare works produced art man: yet know done;
 thereby wee know also means done, count them
 miracles, wrought immediate hand god, but
 mediation humane industry.
 



seemeth miracle one man, may seem otherwise another
 
furthermore, seeing admiration wonder, consequent the
 knowledge experience, wherewith men endued, more, some
 lesse; followeth, thing, may miracle one, and
 another. thence is, ignorant, superstitious men
 make great wonders works, men, knowing proceed
 nature, (which immediate, ordinary work god,)
 admire all: ecclipses sun moon taken
 supernaturall works, common people; neverthelesse, there
 others, naturall causes, foretold very
 hour arrive: or, man, confederacy, secret
 intelligence, getting knowledge private actions ignorant,
 unwary man, thereby tells him, done former time; seems
 miraculous thing; amongst wise, cautelous men, such
 miracles those, easily done.
 



end miracles
 
again, belongeth nature miracle, wrought for
 procuring credit gods messengers, ministers, prophets,
 thereby men may know, called, sent, employed god,
 thereby better inclined obey them. therefore, though
 creation world, destruction living
 creatures universall deluge, admirable works; yet because
 done procure credit prophet, minister
 god, use called miracles. admirable soever any
 work be, admiration consisteth done, because
 men naturally beleeve almighty can doe things, he
 prayer, word man. works god egypt,
 hand moses, properly miracles; done
 intention make people israel beleeve, moses came
 unto them, design owne interest, sent from
 god. therefore god commanded deliver israelites
 egyptian bondage, said (exod 4.1. &c.) "they will not
 beleeve me, will say, lord hath appeared unto me," god gave
 power, turn rod hand serpent, again
 return rod; putting hand bosome, to
 make leprous; pulling make whole, make
 children israel beleeve (as verse 5.) god their
 fathers appeared unto him; enough, gave
 power turn waters bloud. hee done these
 miracles people, said (verse 41.) "they beleeved
 him." neverthelesse, fear pharaoh, durst yet obey him.
 therefore works done plague pharaoh the
 egyptians, tended make israelites beleeve moses, were
 properly miracles. like manner consider miracles
 done hand moses, rest prophets, till the
 captivity; saviour, apostles afterward; we
 shall find, end alwaies beget, confirm beleefe, that
 came motion, sent god. wee may further
 observe scripture, end miracles, beget beleef,
 universally men, elect, reprobate; elect
 only; say, god determined become his
 subjects. miraculous plagues egypt, end, the
 conversion pharaoh; god told moses before, would
 harden heart pharaoh, let people goe: and
 let goe last, miracles perswaded him, the
 plagues forced it. also saviour, written, (mat.
 13. 58.) wrought many miracles countrey, because
 unbeleef; (in marke 6.5.) stead of, "he wrought not
 many," is, "he work none." wanted power;
 say, blasphemy god; end miracles
 convert incredulous men christ; end the
 miracles moses, prophets, saviour, apostles
 adde men church; was, end their
 miracles, adde church (not men, but) should
 saved; say, god elected. seeing therefore
 saviour sent father, hee use power the
 conversion those, father rejected. expounding
 place st. marke, say, word, "hee not," put
 for, "he not," without example greek tongue, (where
 not, put sometimes not, things inanimate, that
 will; not, not, never,) thereby lay
 stumbling block weak christians; christ doe no
 miracles, amongst credulous.
 



definition miracle
 
set down, nature, use a
 miracle, may define thus, "a miracle, work god, (besides
 operation way nature, ordained creation,) done
 making manifest elect, mission extraordinary
 minister salvation."
 
definition, may inferre; first, miracles,
 work done, effect vertue prophet; because
 effect immediate hand god; say god hath
 done it, without using prophet therein, subordinate cause.
 
secondly, devil, angel, created spirit, can a
 miracle. must either vertue naturall science, or
 incantation, is, vertue words. inchanters it
 power independent, power proceedeth not
 god; men deny: doe power given them,
 work immediate hand god, naturall, and
 consequently miracle.
 
texts scripture, seem attribute power of
 working wonders (equall immediate miracles, wrought
 god himself,) certain arts magick, incantation. for
 example, read rod moses cast the
 ground became serpent, (exod. 7. 11.) "the magicians egypt the
 like enchantments;" moses turned waters
 egyptian streams, rivers, ponds, pooles water blood,
 (exod. 7. 22.) "the magicians egypt likewise, their
 enchantments;" moses power god brought
 frogs upon land, (exod. 8. 7.) "the magicians also their
 enchantments, brought frogs upon land egypt;" will a
 man apt attribute miracles enchantments; say, the
 efficacy sound words; think well proved out
 this, places? yet place scripture,
 telleth us enchantment is. therefore enchantment not,
 many think it, working strange effects spells, words;
 imposture, delusion, wrought ordinary means; far
 supernaturall, impostors need study much of
 naturall causes, ordinary ignorance, stupidity, superstition
 mankind, doe them; texts seem countenance power
 magick, witchcraft, enchantment, must needs another sense,
 first sight seem bear.
 



men apt deceived false miracles
 
evident enough, words effect, those
 understand them; other, signifie the
 intentions, passions speak; thereby produce, hope,
 fear, passions, conceptions hearer. therefore a
 rod seemeth serpent, water bloud, miracle seemeth
 done enchantment; edification gods people,
 rod, water, thing enchanted; is
 say, wrought upon words, spectator. the
 miracle consisteth this, enchanter deceived man; which
 miracle, easie matter doe.
 
ignorance, aptitude error generally men,
 especially much knowledge naturall causes,
 nature, interests men; innumerable easie
 tricks abused. opinion miraculous power, was
 known science course stars, might man have
 gained, told people, hour, day sun
 darkned? juggler handling goblets, other
 trinkets, now ordinarily practised, thought
 wonders power least devil. man hath
 practised speak drawing breath, (which kind men in
 antient time called ventriloqui,) make weaknesse of
 voice seem proceed, weak impulsion organs
 speech, distance place, able make many men
 beleeve voice heaven, whatsoever please tell them.
 crafty man, hath enquired secrets, familiar
 confessions one man ordinarily maketh another actions and
 adventures past, tell hard matter; yet there
 many, means that, obtain reputation being
 conjurers. long businesse, reckon severall
 sorts men, greeks called thaumaturgi, say,
 workers things wonderfull; yet do, their
 single dexterity. looke upon impostures wrought by
 confederacy, nothing impossible soever done, is
 impossible bee beleeved. two men conspiring, one seem lame,
 cure charme, will deceive many: many
 conspiring, one seem lame, another cure him, rest
 bear witnesse; will deceive many more.
 



cautions imposture miracles
 
aptitude mankind, give hasty beleefe pretended
 miracles, can better, think caution, than
 god hath prescribed, first moses, (as said before
 precedent chapter,) beginning 13. end the
 18. deuteronomy; wee take prophets, teach any
 religion, gods lieutenant, (which time was
 moses,) hath established; any, (though teach religion,)
 whose praediction doe see come passe. moses therefore his
 time, aaron, successors times, soveraign
 governour gods people, next god himself, say, the
 head church times, consulted, doctrine
 hath established, wee give credit pretended miracle, or
 prophet. done, thing pretend miracle,
 must see done, use means possible consider,
 whether really done; onely so, whether such, as
 man can like naturall power, requires the
 immediate hand god. also must recourse gods
 lieutenant; doubtfull cases, wee submitted our
 private judgments. example; man pretend, certain
 words spoken peece bread, presently god hath made not
 bread, god, man, both, neverthelesse looketh still
 like bread ever did; reason man think
 really done; consequently fear him, till enquire god,
 vicar, lieutenant, whether done, not. say not,
 followeth moses saith, (deut. 18. 22.) "he hath spoken
 presumptuously, thou shalt fear him." say ’tis done, then
 contradict it. also wee see not, onely hear tell
 miracle, consult lawful church; say, the
 lawful head thereof, far give credit relators of
 it. chiefly case men, days live under
 christian soveraigns. times, know one man, that
 ever saw wondrous work, done charm, word,
 prayer man, man endued mediocrity reason,
 think supernaturall: question more, whether wee
 see done, miracle; whether miracle hear, read of, were
 reall work, act tongue, pen; plain terms,
 whether report true, lye. question every
 one, make private reason, conscience, publique
 reason, is, reason gods supreme lieutenant, judge; and
 indeed made judge already, wee given soveraign
 power, doe necessary peace defence. private
 man alwaies liberty, (because thought free,) beleeve,
 beleeve heart, acts given for
 miracles, according shall see, benefit can accrew by
 mens belief, pretend, countenance them, thereby
 conjecture, whether miracles, lies. comes
 confession faith, private reason must submit the
 publique; say, gods lieutenant. lieutenant
 god, head church, shall considered proper place
 thereafter.

 actions, obtain eternall life.
 



place adams eternity sinned, terrestrial paradise
 
first find, adam created condition life,
 broken commandement god, enjoyed the
 paradise eden everlastingly. tree life; whereof
 long allowed eat, forbear eat tree
 knowledge good evill; allowed him. therefore
 soon eaten it, god thrust paradise, "lest he
 put forth hand, take also tree life, live
 ever." (gen. 3. 22.) seemeth me, (with submission
 neverthelesse this, questions, whereof the
 determination dependeth scriptures, interpretation the
 bible authorized common-wealth, whose subject am,) adam if
 sinned, eternall life earth: mortality
 entred upon himself, posterity, first sin. that
 actuall death entred; adam never children;
 whereas lived long after, saw numerous posterity ere dyed.
 said, "in day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt
 surely die," must needs bee meant mortality, certitude
 death. seeing eternall life lost adams forfeiture, in
 committing sin, cancell forfeiture recover
 thereby, life again. now jesus christ hath satisfied sins
 beleeve him; therefore recovered beleevers,
 eternall life, lost adam. sense
 is, comparison st. paul holdeth (rom. 5.18, 19.) "as by
 offence one, judgment came upon men condemnation, even
 righteousnesse one, free gift came upon men
 justification life." (1 cor. 15.21,22) more
 perspicuously delivered words, "for since man came death, by
 man came also resurrection dead. adam die, even
 christ shall made alive."
 



texts concerning place life eternall beleevers
 
concerning place wherein men shall enjoy eternall life, which
 christ hath obtained them, texts next alledged seem to
 make earth. adam, die, is, forfeited
 paradise, eternall life earth; even christ shall be
 made alive; men shall made live earth; else
 comparison proper. hereunto seemeth agree the
 psalmist, (psal. 133.3.) "upon zion god commanded blessing, even
 life evermore;" zion, jerusalem, upon earth: also that
 s. joh. (rev. 2.7.) "to overcommeth will give eat of
 tree life, midst paradise god." this
 tree adams eternall life; life on
 earth. seemeth confirmed st. joh. (rev. 21.2.)
 saith, "i john saw holy city, new jerusalem, coming down
 god heaven, prepared bride adorned husband:"
 v. 10. effect: say, new
 jerusalem, paradise god, coming christ, should
 come gods people heaven, goe from
 earth. differs nothing that, two men white
 clothing (that is, two angels) said apostles, were
 looking upon christ ascending (acts 1.11.) "this jesus, is
 taken heaven, shall come, seen go up
 heaven." soundeth said, come down
 govern father, eternally here; take up
 govern heaven; conformable restauration the
 kingdom god, instituted moses; political government
 jews earth. again, saying saviour (mat. 22.30.)
 "that resurrection neither marry, given marriage,
 angels god heaven," description eternall
 life, resembling lost adam point marriage.
 seeing adam, eve, sinned, lived earth
 eternally, individuall persons; manifest, should
 continually procreated kind. immortals have
 generated, mankind doth now; earth small time, not
 able afford place stand on. jews asked
 saviour question, whose wife woman married many
 brothers, be, resurrection, knew the
 consequences immortality; shal generation, and
 consequently marriage, marriage, generation
 among angels. comparison eternall life adam
 lost, saviour victory death hath recovered; holdeth
 also this, adam lost eternall life sin, yet lived
 time; faithful christian hath recovered eternal
 life christs passion, though die natural death, remaine dead
 time; namely, till resurrection. death reckoned from
 condemnation adam, execution; life reckoned
 absolution, resurrection elected
 christ.
 



ascension heaven
 
place wherein men live eternally, the
 resurrection, heavens, meaning heaven, parts the
 world, remote earth, stars are,
 stars, another higher heaven, called caelum empyreum,
 (whereof mention scripture, ground reason) not
 easily drawn text can find. kingdome of
 heaven, meant kingdome king dwelleth heaven; and
 kingdome people israel, ruled prophets
 lieutenants, first moses, eleazar, soveraign
 priests, till days samuel rebelled, a
 mortall man king, manner nations. and
 saviour christ, preaching ministers, shall have
 perswaded jews return, called gentiles obedience,
 shall new kingdome heaven, king shall
 god, whose throne heaven; without necessity evident in
 scripture, man shall ascend happinesse higher than
 gods footstool earth. contrary, find written (joh. 3.13.)
 "no man hath ascended heaven, came from
 heaven, even man, heaven." observe the
 way, words not, go immediately before, the
 words saviour, st. john himself; christ not
 heaven, upon earth. like said david (acts 2.34.)
 st. peter, prove ascension christ, using words of
 psalmist, (psal. 16.10.) "thou wilt leave soule hell, nor
 suffer thine holy one see corruption," saith, spoken (not
 david, but) christ; prove it, addeth reason, "for
 david ascended heaven." man may easily answer,
 say, though bodies ascend till generall
 day judgment, yet souls heaven soon were
 departed bodies; also seemeth confirmed the
 words saviour (luke 20.37,38.) proving resurrection out
 word moses, saith thus, "that dead raised, even moses
 shewed, bush, calleth lord, god abraham, and
 god isaac, god jacob. god dead,
 living; live him." words to
 understood immortality soul, prove all
 saviour intended prove, resurrection
 body, say, immortality man. therefore our
 saviour meaneth, patriarchs immortall; property
 consequent essence, nature mankind, will of
 god, pleased mere grace, bestow eternall life upon
 faithfull. though time patriarchs many other
 faithfull men dead, yet text, lived god;
 is, written book life were
 absolved sinnes, ordained life eternall the
 resurrection. soul man nature eternall, and
 living creature independent body; meer man is
 immortall, otherwise resurrection last day, (except
 enos elias,) doctrine apparent scripture. whole 14.
 chapter job, speech friends, himselfe,
 complaint mortality nature; yet contradiction of
 immortality resurrection. "there hope tree," (saith
 hee verse 7.) "if cast down, though root thereof wax old, and
 stock thereof die ground, yet scenteth water
 will bud, bring forth boughes like plant. man dyeth, and
 wasteth away, yea, man giveth ghost, he?" (verse
 12.) "man lyeth down, riseth not, till heavens more." but
 it, heavens shall more? st. peter tells us, that
 generall resurrection. 2. epistle, 3. chapter,
 7. verse, saith, "the heavens earth now,
 reserved unto fire day judgment, perdition of
 ungodly men," (verse 12.) "looking for, hasting comming
 god, wherein heavens shall fire, shall dissolved,
 elements shall melt fervent heat. neverthelesse, we
 according promise look new heavens, new earth, wherein
 dwelleth righteousnesse." therefore job saith, man riseth till
 heavens more; one, said, immortall
 life (and soule life scripture, usually signifie same
 thing) beginneth man, till resurrection, day judgment;
 hath cause, specificall nature, generation; the
 promise. st. peter saies not, "wee look new heavens, new
 earth, (from nature) promise."
 
lastly, seeing hath already proved divers evident places
 scripture, 35. chapter book, kingdom god
 civil common-wealth, god soveraign, vertue
 first old, since new covenant, wherein reigneth by
 vicar, lieutenant; places therefore also prove, that
 comming saviour majesty, glory, to
 reign actually, eternally; kingdom god earth. but
 doctrine (though proved places scripture few,
 obscure) will appear men novelty; doe propound
 it; maintaining nothing this, paradox religion;
 attending end dispute sword, concerning the
 authority, (not yet amongst countrey-men decided,) sorts
 doctrine bee approved, rejected; whose commands, both
 speech, writing, (whatsoever opinions private men) must
 men, mean protected laws, obeyed. for
 points doctrine concerning kingdome (of) god, great
 influence kingdome man, determined, them,
 god soveraign power.
 



place judgment, never kingdome of
 god, in, cast out
 
kingdome god, eternall life, also gods enemies, and
 torments judgment, appear scripture, their
 place earth. name place, men remain till the
 resurrection, either buryed, swallowed earth, is
 usually called scripture, words signifie ground; which
 latines read generally infernus, inferni, greeks hades;
 say, place men see; containeth well the
 grave, deeper place. place damned after
 resurrection, determined, neither old, new
 testament, note situation; onely company: that
 shall bee, wicked men were, god former times in
 extraordinary, miraculous manner, destroyed face of
 earth: example, inferno, tartarus, in
 bottomelesse pit; corah, dathan, abirom, swallowed
 alive earth. writers scripture would
 us beleeve, globe earth, is
 finite, also (compared height stars) no
 considerable magnitude, pit without bottome; is, hole of
 infinite depth, greeks daemonologie (that to
 say, doctrine concerning daemons,) them, romans
 called tartarus; virgill sayes,
 
bis patet præceps, tantem tendítque sub umbras,
 quantus ad æthereum cœli suspectus olympum:
 
thing proportion earth heaven bear: but
 wee beleeve there, indefinitely, men are,
 god inflicted exemplary punnishment.
 



congregation giants
 
again, mighty men earth, lived time
 noah, floud, (which greeks called heroes, the
 scripture giants, say, begotten, copulation the
 children god, children men,) wicked life
 destroyed generall deluge; place damned, therefore
 also sometimes marked out, company deceased giants; as
 proverbs 21.16. "the man wandreth way understanding,
 shall remain congregation giants," job 26.5. "behold
 giants groan water, dwell them." here
 place damned, water. isaiah 14.9. "hell is
 troubled meet thee," (that is, king babylon) "and will
 displace giants thee:" place damned,
 (if sense literall,) water.
 



lake fire
 
thirdly, cities sodom, gomorrah, extraordinary
 wrath god, consumed wickednesse fire and
 brimstone, together countrey made stinking
 bituminous lake; place damned sometimes expressed by
 fire, fiery lake: apocalypse ch.21.8. "but timorous,
 incredulous, abominable, murderers, whoremongers, and
 sorcerers, idolators, lyars, shall part the
 lake burneth fire, brimstone; second death."
 manifest, hell fire, expressed by
 metaphor, reall fire sodome, signifieth certain
 kind, place torment; taken indefinitely, for
 destruction, 20. chapter, 14. verse; is
 said, "death hell cast lake fire;" is
 say, abolished, destroyed; day judgment,
 shall dying, going hell; is, no
 going hades (from word perhaps word hell derived,)
 dying.
 



utter darknesse
 
fourthly, plague darknesse inflicted egyptians, of
 written (exod. 10.23.) "they saw one another, neither
 rose man place three days; children of
 israel light dwellings;" place wicked after
 judgment, called utter darknesse, (as originall)
 darknesse without. expressed (mat. 22.13.) king
 commandeth servants, "to bind hand foot man not
 wedding garment, cast out," eis skotos exoteron,
 externall darknesse, darknesse without: though translated utter
 darknesse, signifie great, darknesse to
 be; namely, without habitation gods elect.
 



gehenna, tophet
 
lastly, whereas place neer jerusalem, called valley of
 children hinnon; part whereof, called tophet, jews had
 committed grievous idolatry, sacrificing children the
 idol moloch; wherein also god afflicted enemies most
 grievous punishments; wherein josias burnt priests moloch
 upon altars, appeareth large 2 kings chap. 23.
 place served afterwards, receive filth, garbage was
 carried thither, city; used fires made, from
 time time, purifie aire, take away stench carrion.
 abominable place, jews used ever call place
 damned, name gehenna, valley hinnon. this
 gehenna, word, usually now translated hell; and
 fires time time burning, notion of
 everlasting, unquenchable fire.
 



literall sense scripture concerning hell
 
seeing now none, interprets scripture, that
 day judgment, wicked eternally punished
 valley hinnon; shall rise again, ever
 ground, water; resurrection, they
 shall see one another; stir one place another; it
 followeth, thinks, necessarily, thus said
 concerning hell fire, spoken metaphorically; therefore there
 proper sense bee enquired after, (for metaphors is
 reall ground, may expressed proper words) the
 place hell, nature hellish torment, tormenters.
 



satan, devill, proper names, appellatives
 
first tormenters, wee nature, properties,
 exactly properly delivered names of, enemy, satan;
 accuser, diabolus; destroyer, abbadon. significant
 names, satan, devill, abbadon, set forth us individuall
 person, proper names use doe; onely office, quality;
 therefore appellatives; left
 untranslated, are, latine, modern bibles; because
 thereby seem proper names daemons; men the
 easily seduced beleeve doctrine devills; that
 time religion gentiles, contrary moses,
 christ.
 
enemy, accuser, destroyer, meant, the
 enemy shall kingdome god; therefore the
 kingdome god resurrection, bee upon earth, (as the
 former chapter shewn scripture seems be,) enemy,
 kingdome must earth also. also it, time
 jews deposed god. gods kingdome palestine;
 nations round about, kingdomes enemy; and
 consequently satan, meant earthly enemy church.
 



torments hell
 
torments hell, expressed sometimes, "weeping, gnashing
 teeth," mat. 8.12. sometimes, "the worm conscience;" as
 isa.66.24. mark 9.44, 46, 48; sometimes, fire, place
 now quoted, "where worm dyeth not, fire quenched,"
 many places beside: sometimes "shame, contempt," dan.
 12.2. "and many sleep dust earth, shall
 awake; everlasting life; shame, everlasting
 contempt." places design metaphorically grief, and
 discontent mind, sight eternall felicity others,
 incredulity, disobedience
 lost. felicity others, sensible by
 comparison actuall miseries; followeth are
 suffer bodily paines, calamities, incident those,
 onely live evill cruell governours, also for
 enemy, eternall king saints, god almighty. amongst these
 bodily paines, reckoned also every one wicked a
 second death. though scripture bee clear universall
 resurrection; yet wee read, reprobate is
 promised eternall life. whereas st. paul (1 cor. 15.42, 43.) to
 question concerning bodies men shall rise again, saith,
 "the body sown corruption, raised incorruption; it
 sown dishonour, raised glory; sown weaknesse, it
 raised power;" glory power applyed bodies of
 wicked: can name second death, bee applyed those
 can never die once: although metaphoricall speech, a
 calamitous life everlasting, may bee called everlasting death yet it
 well understood second death. fire prepared the
 wicked, everlasting fire: say, estate wherein
 man can without torture, body mind, the
 resurrection, shall endure ever; sense fire shall
 unquenchable, torments everlasting: thence be
 inferred, hee shall cast fire, tormented
 torments, shall endure, resist so, be
 eternally burnt, tortured, yet never destroyed, die. and
 though many places affirm everlasting fire, torments
 (into men may cast successively one another ever;)
 yet find none affirm shall bee eternall life therein of
 individuall person; contrary, everlasting death, which
 second death: (apoc. 20. 13,14.) "for death, grave
 shall delivered dead them, every man be
 judged according works; death grave shall also cast
 lake fire. second death." whereby is
 evident, bee second death every one shall bee
 condemned day judgement, hee shall die more.
 



joyes life eternall, salvation thing,
 salvation sin, misery, one
 
joyes life eternall, scripture comprehended the
 name salvation, saved. saved, secured, either
 respectively, speciall evills, absolutely evill,
 comprehending want, sicknesse, death self. man
 created condition immortall, subject corruption, and
 consequently nothing tendeth dissolution nature;
 fell happinesse adam; followeth, that
 saved sin, saved evill, calamities
 sinne hath brought upon us. therefore holy scripture,
 remission sinne, salvation death misery, same
 thing, appears words saviour, cured man
 sick palsey, saying, (mat. 9.2.) "son good cheer, thy
 sins forgiven thee;" knowing scribes took blasphemy,
 man pretend forgive sins, asked (v.5.) "whether
 easier say, thy sinnes forgiven thee, or, arise walk;"
 signifying thereby, one, saving sick,
 say, "thy sins forgiven," "arise walk;" used
 form speech, onely shew power forgive sins. and
 besides evident reason, since death misery, the
 punishments sin, discharge sinne, must also discharge
 death misery; say, salvation absolute, the
 faithfull enjoy day judgment, power, and
 favour jesus christ, cause called saviour.
 
concerning particular salvations, understood, 1 sam. 14.39.
 "as lord liveth saveth israel," is, temporary
 enemies, 2 sam. 22.4. "thou art saviour, thou savest from
 violence;" 2 kings 13.5. "god gave israelites saviour, and
 delivered hand assyrians," like,
 need say nothing; neither difficulty, interest, to
 corrupt interpretation texts kind.
 



place eternall salvation
 
concerning generall salvation, must the
 kingdome heaven, great difficulty concerning place.
 one side, kingdome (which estate ordained men their
 perpetuall security enemies, want) seemeth this
 salvation earth. salvation set forth unto us,
 glorious reign king, conquest; safety escape:
 therefore look salvation, must look also
 triumph; triumph, victory; victory, for
 battell; well supposed, shall heaven. good
 soever reason may be, will trust it, without evident
 places scripture. state salvation described large,
 isaiah, 33. ver. 20,21,22,23,24.
 
"look upon zion, city solemnities, thine eyes shall see
 jerusalem quiet habitation, tabernacle shall taken down;
 one stakes thereof shall ever removed, neither shall any
 cords thereof broken.
 
glorious lord will unto us place broad rivers, and
 streams; wherein shall goe gally oares; neither shall gallant
 ship passe thereby.
 
lord judge, lord lawgiver, lord our
 king, will save us.
 
thy tacklings loosed; well strengthen mast;
 spread sail: prey great spoil
 divided; lame take prey.
 
inhabitant shall say, sicke; people shall
 dwell therein shall forgiven iniquity."
 
words wee place whence salvation proceed,
 "jerusalem, quiet habitation;" eternity it, "a tabernacle that
 shall taken down," &c. saviour it, "the lord, judge,
 lawgiver, king, will save us;" salvation, "the lord
 shall broad mote swift waters," &c. condition of
 enemies, "their tacklings loose, masts weake, the
 lame shal take spoil them." condition saved,
 "the inhabitants shall say, sick:" lastly, is
 comprehended forgivenesse sin, "the people dwell therein
 shall forgiven iniquity." evident, that
 salvation shall earth, then, god shall reign, (at coming
 christ) jerusalem; jerusalem shall proceed the
 salvation gentiles shall received gods kingdome; as
 also expressely declared prophet, chap. 66.20, 21.
 "and they," (that is, gentiles jew bondage) "shall
 bring brethren, offering lord, all
 nations, upon horses, charets, litters, upon mules,
 upon swift beasts, holy mountain, jerusalem, saith lord,
 children israel bring offering clean vessell into
 house lord. will also take priests for
 levites, saith lord:" whereby manifest, chief seat of
 gods kingdome (which place, whence salvation us that
 gentiles, shall proceed) shall jerusalem; also
 confirmed saviour, discourse woman samaria,
 concerning place gods worship; saith, john 4.22. that
 samaritans worshipped know what, jews worship what
 knew, "for salvation jews (ex judais, is, begins at
 jews): say, worship god, know whom
 wil save you, doe, know shall one tribe
 judah, jew, samaritan. therefore also woman not
 impertinently answered again, "we know messias shall come." so
 saviour saith, "salvation jews," the
 paul sayes (rom. 1.16,17.) "the gospel power god to
 salvation every one beleeveth; jew first, also the
 greek. therein righteousnesse god revealed faith to
 faith;" faith jew, faith gentile. in
 like sense prophet joel describing day judgment, (chap.
 2.30,31.) god "shew wonders heaven, earth, bloud,
 fire, pillars smoak. sun turned darknesse,
 moon bloud, great terrible day lord
 come," addeth verse 32. "and shall come passe, whosoever
 shall call upon name lord, shall saved. mount zion,
 jerusalem shall salvation." obadiah verse 17 saith
 same, "upon mount zion shall deliverance; shall be
 holinesse, house jacob shall possesse possessions,"
 is, possessions heathen, possessions expresseth
 particularly following verses, mount esau, the
 land philistines, fields ephraim, samaria, gilead, and
 cities south, concludes words, "the kingdom
 shall lords." places salvation, the
 kingdome god (after day judgement) upon earth. other
 side, found text can probably drawn, prove
 ascension saints heaven; say, coelum
 empyreum, aetheriall region; saving called the
 kingdome heaven; name may have, god, king
 jews, governed commands, sent moses angels from
 heaven, reduce obedience; shall send thence
 again, rule them, faithfull men, day of
 judgment, everlastingly: that, throne great
 king heaven; whereas earth footstoole. the
 subjects god place high throne, higher
 footstoole, seemeth sutable dignity king,
 can find evident text holy scripture.
 
hath said kingdom god, salvation,
 hard interpret, meant world come. there
 three worlds mentioned scripture, old world, present
 world, world come. first, st. peter speaks, (2 pet.
 2.5.) "if god spared old world, saved noah eighth
 person, preacher righteousnesse, bringing flood upon world
 ungodly," &c. first world, adam generall
 flood. present world, saviour speaks (john 18.36.) "my
 kingdome world." came onely teach men way
 salvation, renew kingdome father, doctrine.
 world come, st. peter speaks, (2 pet. 3. 13.) "neverthelesse
 according promise look new heavens, new earth." this
 world, wherein christ coming heaven, clouds,
 great power, glory, shall send angels, shall gather
 together elect, four winds, uttermost parts
 earth, thence forth reign them, (under father)
 everlastingly.
 



redemption
 
salvation sinner, supposeth precedent redemption; is
 guilty sin, obnoxious penalty same; must
 pay (or him) ransome, offended, and
 power, shall require. seeing person offended, is
 almighty god, whose power things; ransome paid
 salvation can acquired, god hath pleased require.
 ransome, intended satisfaction sin, equivalent to
 offence, sinner himselfe, righteous man can ever be
 able make another; dammage man another, may make
 amends restitution, recompence, taken
 away recompence; make liberty sin, thing
 vendible. sins may bee pardoned repentant, either gratis, or
 upon penalty, god pleased accept. god usually
 accepted old testament, sacrifice, oblation. to
 forgive act injustice, though punishment have
 threatned. even amongst men, though promise good, bind the
 promiser; yet threats, say, promises, evill, bind them
 not; much lesse shall bind god, infinitely mercifull
 men. saviour christ therefore redeem us, that
 sense satisfie sins men, death, own
 vertue, make unjust god punish sinners eternall
 death; make sacrifice, oblation himself, his
 first coming, god pleased require, salvation his
 second coming, mean time repent, beleeve in
 him. though act redemption, alwaies scripture
 called sacrifice, oblation, sometimes price, yet price
 understand thing, value whereof, claim
 right pardon us, offended father, price which
 god father pleased mercy demand.
 


chapter xxxix. signification scripture word church
 



church lords house
 
word church, (ecclesia) signifieth books holy scripture
 divers things. sometimes (though often) taken gods house,
 say, temple, wherein christians assemble perform
 holy duties publiquely; as, 1 cor. 14. ver. 34. "let women keep
 silence churches:" metaphorically put, the
 congregation assembled; hath since used the
 edifice self, distinguish temples christians, and
 idolaters. temple jerusalem gods house, house of
 prayer; edifice dedicated christians worship of
 christ, christs house: therefore greek fathers call kuriake,
 lords house; thence, language came called kyrke,
 church.
 



ecclesia properly what
 
church (when taken house) signifieth ecclesia
 signified grecian common-wealths; say, congregation,
 assembly citizens, called forth, hear magistrate speak
 unto them; common-wealth rome called concio, as
 spake called ecclesiastes, concionator. they
 called forth lawfull authority, (acts 19.39.) ecclesia
 legitima, lawfull church, ennomos ecclesia. excited
 tumultuous, seditious clamor, confused church,
 ecclesia sugkechumene.
 
taken also sometimes men right the
 congregation, though actually assembled; say, the
 whole multitude christian men, far soever dispersed: as
 (act. 8.3.) said, "saul made havock church:" and
 sense christ said head church. sometimes for
 certain part christians, (col. 4.15.) "salute church is
 house." sometimes also elect onely; (ephes. 5.27.) "a
 glorious church, without spot, wrinkle, holy, without blemish;"
 meant church triumphant, or, church come. sometimes,
 congregation assembled, professors christianity, whether
 profession true, counterfeit, understood, mat.
 18.17. said, "tell church, hee neglect to
 hear church, let thee gentile, publican."
 



sense church one person church defined
 
last sense church can taken one
 person; say, can said power will, to
 pronounce, command, obeyed, make laws, doe other
 action whatsoever; without authority lawfull congregation,
 whatsoever act done concourse people, particular
 act every one present, gave aid the
 performance it; act grosse, one
 body; much lesse act absent, being
 present, willing done. according sense, i
 define church be, "a company men professing christian religion,
 united person one soveraign; whose command to
 assemble, without whose authority assemble." and
 common-wealths, assembly, without warrant
 civil soveraign, unlawful; church also, is
 assembled common-wealth, hath forbidden assemble, is
 unlawfull assembly.
 



christian common-wealth, church one
 
followeth also, earth, universall church as
 christians bound obey; power earth, to
 common-wealths subject: christians, in
 dominions severall princes states; every one them
 subject common-wealth, whereof member; and
 consequently, subject commands person.
 therefore church, one capable command, judge,
 absolve, condemn, act, thing civil
 common-wealth, consisting christian men; called civill
 state, subjects men; church, the
 subjects thereof christians. temporall spirituall government,
 two words brought world, make men see double, and
 mistake lawfull soveraign. true, bodies the
 faithfull, resurrection shall onely spirituall, but
 eternall; life grosse, corruptible. there
 therefore government life, neither state, nor
 religion, temporall; teaching doctrine, lawfull any
 subject, governour state, religion,
 forbiddeth taught: governor must one; else there
 must needs follow faction, civil war common-wealth, between
 church state; spiritualists, temporalists; between
 sword justice, shield faith; (which more) in
 every christian mans brest, christian, man.
 doctors church, called pastors; also civill
 soveraignes: pastors subordinate one another, so
 may bee one chief pastor, men will taught contrary
 doctrines, whereof may be, one must false. one
 chief pastor is, according law nature, hath already
 shewn; namely, civill soveraign; the
 scripture hath assigned office, shall see chapters
 following.
 



chapter xl rights kingdome god, abraham, moses,
 high priests, kings judah
 



soveraign rights abraham
 
father faithfull, first kingdome god by
 covenant, abraham. covenant first made; wherein
 obliged himself, seed him, acknowledge obey the
 commands god; onely such, take notice of, (as morall
 laws,) light nature; also such, god speciall
 manner deliver dreams visions. morall law,
 already obliged, needed contracted withall,
 promise land canaan. contract, could
 adde to, strengthen obligation, they, all
 men else bound naturally obey god almighty: therefore the
 covenant abraham made god, take commandement
 god, name god commanded him, dream, or
 vision, deliver family, cause observe the
 same.
 



abraham sole power ordering religion people
 
contract god abraham, wee may observe three points of
 important consequence government gods people. first, at
 making covenant, god spake onely abraham; therefore
 contracted family, seed, otherwise their
 wills (which make essence covenants) contract
 involved will abraham; therefore supposed had
 lawfull power, make perform covenanted them.
 according whereunto (gen 18.18, 19.) god saith, "all nations the
 earth shall blessed him, know will command his
 children houshold him, shall keep way the
 lord." whence may concluded first point, to
 god hath spoken immediately, receive positive
 commandements god, soveraign; family seed of
 abraham abraham father, lord, civill soveraign.
 consequently every common-wealth, supernaturall
 revelation contrary, obey laws own
 soveraign, externall acts profession religion. the
 inward thought, beleef men, humane governours can take no
 notice of, (for god onely knoweth heart) voluntary, nor
 effect laws, unrevealed will, power of
 god; consequently fall obligation.
 



pretence private spirit religion abraham
 
whence proceedeth another point, unlawfull for
 abraham, subjects pretend private vision, or
 spirit, revelation god, countenancing any
 doctrine abraham forbid, followed, adhered
 pretender, punish them; consequently is
 lawfull now soveraign punish man shall oppose his
 private spirit laws: hee hath place the
 common-wealth, abraham family.
 



abraham sole judge, interpreter god spake
 
ariseth also same, third point; none but
 abraham family, none soveraign christian
 common-wealth, can take notice is, word god.
 god spake onely abraham; onely, able
 know god said, interpret family: and
 therefore also, place abraham common-wealth,
 onely interpreters god hath spoken.
 



authority moses whereon grounded
 
covenant renewed isaac; afterwards jacob; but
 afterwards more, till israelites freed egyptians,
 arrived foot mount sinai: renewed moses
 (as said before, chap. 35.) manner, became from
 time forward peculiar kingdome god; whose lieutenant was
 moses, owne time; succession office setled
 upon aaron, heirs him, bee god sacerdotall
 kingdome ever.
 
constitution, kingdome acquired god. seeing moses
 authority govern israelites, successor right
 abraham, claim inheritance; appeareth
 yet, people obliged take gods
 lieutenant, longer beleeved god spake unto him. and
 therefore authority (notwithstanding covenant made with
 god) depended yet merely upon opinion sanctity,
 reality conferences god, verity his
 miracles; opinion coming change, obliged to
 take thing law god, propounded gods
 name. therefore consider, ground was, of
 obligation obey him. commandement of
 god oblige them; god spake immediately,
 mediation moses himself; saviour saith himself,
 (john 5. 31.) "if bear witnesse self, witnesse true,"
 much lesse moses bear witnesse himselfe, (especially claim of
 kingly power gods people) testimony received. his
 authority therefore, authority princes, must be
 grounded consent people, promise obey him.
 was: "the people" (exod. 20.18.) "when saw the
 thunderings, lightnings, noyse trumpet, the
 mountaine smoaking, removed, stood far off. said unto
 moses, speak thou us, will hear, let god speak with
 us lest die." promise obedience; was
 obliged obey whatsoever deliver unto them
 commandement god.
 



moses (under god) soveraign jews, time, though
 aaron priesthood
 
notwithstanding covenant constituted sacerdotall kingdome,
 say, kingdome hereditary aaron; yet be
 understood succession, moses bee dead. for
 whosoever ordereth, establisheth policy, first founder of
 common-wealth (be monarchy, aristocracy, democracy) must needs
 soveraign power people it.
 moses power time, evidently affirmed in
 scripture. first, text last cited, people
 promised obedience, aaron him. secondly, (exod. 24.1, 2.)
 "and god said unto moses, come unto lord, thou, aaron, nadab
 abihu, seventy elders israel. moses alone shall
 come neer lord, shall come nigh, neither shall the
 people goe him." plain, moses alone
 called god, (and aaron, priests, seventy
 elders, people forbidden come up) alone he, that
 represented israelites person god; say, was
 sole soveraign god. though afterwards said (verse
 9.) "then went moses, aaron, nadab, abihu, seventy the
 elders israel, saw god israel, under
 feet, paved work saphire stone," &c. yet was
 till moses god before, brought to
 people words god said him. onely went the
 businesse people; others, nobles retinue, were
 admitted honour speciall grace, allowed to
 people; was, (as verse appeareth) see god and
 live. "god laid hand upon them, saw god eat and
 drink" (that is, live), carry commandement from
 people. again, every said, "the lord spake unto
 moses," occasions government; also ordering
 ceremonies religion, contained 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,
 31 chapters exodus, throughout leviticus: aaron seldome.
 calfe aaron made, moses threw fire. lastly, the
 question authority aaron, occasion miriams
 mutiny moses, (numbers 12.) judged god moses.
 also question moses, people, corah,
 dathan, abiram, two hundred fifty princes assembly
 "gathered together" (numbers 16. 3) "against moses, and
 aaron, said unto them, ‘ye take much upon you, seeing
 congregation holy, every one them, lord is
 amongst them, lift selves congregation the
 lord?’" god caused earth swallow corah, dathan, abiram with
 wives children alive, consumed two hundred fifty
 princes fire. therefore neither aaron, people, any
 aristocracy chief princes people, moses alone next
 god soveraignty israelites: onely in
 causes civill policy, also religion; moses onely spake
 god, therefore onely tell people, that
 god required hands. man upon pain death might so
 presumptuous approach mountain god talked moses.
 "thou shalt set bounds" (saith lord, exod 19. 12.) "to people
 round about, say, take heed selves goe into
 mount, touch border it; whosoever toucheth mount shall
 surely put death." (verse 21.) "get down, charge the
 people, lest break unto lord gaze." we
 may conclude, whosoever christian common-wealth holdeth the
 place moses, sole messenger god, interpreter of
 commandements. according hereunto, man the
 interpretation scripture proceed bounds which
 set severall soveraigns. scriptures since god now
 speaketh them, mount sinai; bounds whereof laws
 represent gods person earth. look upon and
 therein behold wondrous works god, learn fear is
 allowed; interpret them; is, pry god saith to
 appointeth govern him, make judges
 whether govern god commandeth him, not, transgresse the
 bounds god hath set us, gaze upon god irreverently.
 



spirits subordinate spirit moses
 
prophet time moses, pretender spirit
 god, moses approved, authorized. were
 time seventy men, said prophecy spirit of
 god, moses election; concerning god saith
 moses (numb. 11.16.) "gather mee seventy elders israel,
 thou knowest elders people." god imparted
 spirit; different spirit moses; for
 said (verse 25.) "god came cloud, took spirit
 upon moses, gave seventy elders." have
 shewn (chap. 36.) spirit, understood mind; the
 sense place this, god endued with
 mind conformable, subordinate moses, might
 prophecy, say, speak people gods name, such
 manner, set forward (as ministers moses, authority)
 doctrine agreeable moses doctrine. but
 ministers; two prophecyed camp, thought
 new unlawfull thing; 27. 28. verses of
 chapter, accused it, joshua advised moses to
 forbid them, knowing moses spirit they
 prophecyed. manifest, subject pretend to
 prophecy, spirit, opposition doctrine established by
 him, god hath set place moses.
 



moses soveraignty high priest
 
aaron dead, also moses, kingdome, a
 sacerdotall kingdome, descended vertue covenant, aarons
 son, eleazar high priest: god declared (next himself)
 soveraign, time appointed joshua the
 generall army. thus god saith expressely (numb. 27.21.)
 concerning joshua; "he shall stand eleazar priest, shall
 ask counsell him, lord, word shall goe out,
 word shall come in, he, children of
 israel him:" therefore supreme power making war peace,
 priest. supreme power judicature belonged also to
 high priest: book law keeping; the
 priests levites onely subordinate judges causes civill,
 appears deut. 17.8, 9, 10. manner gods worship,
 never doubt made, high priest till time
 saul, supreme authority. therefore civill and
 ecclesiasticall power joined together one same
 person, high priest; bee so, whosoever governeth by
 divine right; is, authority immediate god.
 



soveraign power time joshua saul
 
death joshua, till time saul, time is
 noted frequently book judges, "that dayes
 king israel;" sometimes addition, "every
 man right eyes." bee
 understood, said, "there king," meant, "there
 soveraign power" israel. was, consider the
 act, exercise power. death joshua, &
 eleazar, "there arose another generation" (judges 2.10.) "that knew not
 lord, works done israel, evill in
 sight lord, served baalim." jews quality
 st. paul noteth, "to look sign," onely would
 submit government moses, also had
 obliged submission. whereas signs, miracles had
 end procure faith, keep men violating it, they
 given it; men obliged law nature.
 consider exercise, right governing, the
 soveraign power still high priest. therefore whatsoever
 obedience yeelded judges, (who men chosen god
 extraordinarily, save rebellious subjects hands of
 enemy,) bee drawn argument right high
 priest soveraign power, matters, policy and
 religion. neither judges, samuel himselfe ordinary,
 extraordinary calling government; obeyed the
 israelites, duty, reverence favour
 god, appearing wisdome, courage, felicity. hitherto
 therefore right regulating policy, religion,
 inseparable.
 



rights kings israel
 
judges, succeeded kings; whereas before, authority, both
 religion, policy, high priest; now in
 king. soveraignty people, before, not
 onely vertue divine power, also particular pact of
 israelites god, next him, high priest, his
 viceregent earth, cast people, consent god
 himselfe. said samuel (1 sam. 8.5.) "make us king to
 judge us, like nations," signified no
 bee governed commands bee laid upon the
 priest, name god; one command the
 manner nations commanded; consequently in
 deposing high priest royall authority, deposed peculiar
 government god. yet god consented it, saying samuel (verse
 7.) "hearken unto voice people, shall say
 unto thee; rejected thee, rejected mee,
 reign them." therefore rejected god, in
 whose right priests governed, authority left the
 priests, king pleased allow them; was
 more, lesse, according kings good, evill. the
 government civill affaires, manifest, hands
 king. chapter, verse 20. say will be
 like nations; king shall judge, goe
 them, fight battells; is, shall the
 whole authority, peace war. contained also the
 ordering religion; word god time,
 regulate religion, law moses, their
 civill law. besides, read (1 kings 2.27.) solomon "thrust out
 abiathar priest lord:" therefore authority
 high priest, subject; great
 mark supremacy religion. read also (1 kings 8.) hee
 dedicated temple; blessed people; himselfe
 person made excellent prayer, used consecrations all
 churches, houses prayer; another great mark supremacy
 religion. again, read (2 kings 22.) question
 concerning book law found temple, not
 decided high priest, josiah sent him, others to
 enquire concerning it, hulda, prophetesse; another mark
 supremacy religion. lastly, wee read (1 chro. 26.30.) that
 david made hashabiah brethren, hebronites, officers israel
 among westward, "in businesse lord, service
 king." likewise (verse 32.) hee made hebronites,
 "rulers reubenites, gadites, halfe tribe of
 manasseh" (these rest israel dwelt beyond jordan) "for
 every matter pertaining god, affairs king." this
 full power, temporall spirituall, call it, would
 divide it? conclude; first institution gods kingdome, to
 captivity, supremacy religion, hand that
 civill soveraignty; priests office election of
 saul, magisteriall, ministeriall.
 



practice supremacy religion, time kings,
 according right thereof
 
notwithstanding government policy religion, joined,
 first high priests, afterwards kings, far forth as
 concerned right; yet appeareth holy history, the
 people understood not; amongst great part, and
 probably greatest part, longer saw great miracles,
 (which equivalent miracle) great abilities, great felicity
 enterprises governours, gave sufficient credit, either
 fame moses, colloquies god priests;
 took occasion oft governours displeased them, by
 blaming sometimes policy, sometimes religion, change the
 government, revolt obedience pleasure: from
 thence proceeded time time civill troubles, divisions, and
 calamities nation. example, death eleazar and
 joshua, next generation seen wonders god, but
 left weak reason, knowing obliged
 covenant sacerdotall kingdome, regarded the
 commandement priest, law moses, every man that
 right eyes; obeyed civill affairs, such
 men, time time thought able deliver the
 neighbour nations oppressed them; consulted god (as
 doe,) men, women, guessed bee
 prophets praedictions things come; thought had
 idol chappel, yet levite chaplain,
 made account worshipped god israel.
 
afterwards demanded king, manner the
 nations; yet design depart worship god
 king; despairing justice sons samuel, they
 king judg civill actions; they
 allow king change religion thought was
 recommended moses. alwaies kept store a
 pretext, either justice, religion, discharge of
 obedience, whensoever hope prevaile. samuel was
 displeased people, desired king, (for god was
 king already, samuel authority him); yet did
 samuel, saul observed counsell, destroying agag god
 commanded, anoint another king, namely david, take succession
 heirs. rehoboam idolater; people thought
 oppressor; civil pretence carried ten tribes to
 jeroboam idolater. generally whole history the
 kings, well judah, israel, prophets alwaies
 controlled kings, transgressing religion; sometimes also
 errours state; (2 chro. 19. 2.) jehosaphat reproved by
 prophet jehu, aiding king israel syrians;
 hezekiah, isaiah, shewing treasures ambassadors of
 babylon. appeareth, though power state
 religion kings; yet none uncontrolled
 use it, gracious naturall
 abilities, felicities. practise times,
 can argument drawn, right supremacy religion
 kings, unlesse place prophets; conclude,
 hezekiah praying lord cherubins, not
 answered thence, then, afterwards prophet isaiah,
 therefore isaiah supreme head church; josiah
 consulted hulda prophetesse, concerning book law, that
 therefore neither he, high priest, hulda prophetesse had
 supreme authority matter religion; thinke the
 opinion doctor.
 



captivity jews setled common-wealth
 
captivity, jews common-wealth all: after
 return, though renewed covenant god, yet there
 promise made obedience, neither esdras, other;
 presently became subjects greeks (from whose
 customes, daemonology, doctrine cabalists,
 religion became much corrupted): sort nothing can be
 gathered confusion, state religion, concerning
 supremacy either. therefore far forth concerneth the
 old testament, may conclude, whosoever soveraignty of
 common-wealth amongst jews, also supreme
 authority matter gods externall worship; represented gods
 person; person god father; though called
 name father, till time sent world son
 jesus christ, redeem mankind sins, bring into
 everlasting kingdome, saved evermore. to
 speak chapter following.
 


chapter xli. office blessed saviour
 



three parts office christ
 
find holy scripture three parts office messiah: the
 first redeemer, saviour: second pastor, counsellour,
 teacher, is, prophet sent god, convert god
 hath elected salvation; third king, eternall king, but
 father, moses high priests severall
 times. three parts corespondent three times. our
 redemption wrought first coming, sacrifice, wherein
 offered sinnes upon crosse: conversion
 wrought partly person; partly worketh now his
 ministers; will continue work till coming again. after
 coming again, shall begin glorious reign elect,
 last eternally.
 



office redeemer
 
office redeemer, is, one payeth ransome of
 sin, (which ransome death,) appertaineth, sacrificed,
 thereby bare upon head, carryed away us our
 iniquities, sort god required. death one
 man, though without sinne, can satisfie offences men,
 rigour justice, mercy god, ordained such
 sacrifices sin, pleased mercy accept. old
 law (as may read, leviticus 16.) lord required, there
 every year once, bee made atonement sins all
 israel, priests, others; whereof, aaron alone was
 sacrifice priests young bullock; the
 rest people, receive two young goates, of
 sacrifice one; other, scape
 goat, lay hands head thereof, confession
 iniquities people, lay head, then
 opportune man, cause goat led wildernesse,
 escape, carry away iniquities the
 people. sacrifice one goat sufficient (because an
 acceptable) price ransome israel; death the
 messiah, sufficient price, sins mankind, because
 required. saviour christs sufferings seem be
 figured, cleerly, oblation isaac, other
 type old testament: sacrificed goat, and
 scape goat; "hee oppressed, afflicted (isa. 53.7.);
 opened mouth; brought lamb slaughter, a
 sheep dumbe shearer, opened mouth:" he
 sacrificed goat. "he hath born griefs, (ver.4.) carried
 sorrows;" again, (ver. 6.) "the lord hath laid upon the
 iniquities us all:" scape goat. "he cut from
 land living (ver. 8.) transgression people:"
 sacrificed goat. (ver. 11.) "he shall
 bear sins:" hee scape goat. thus lamb god
 equivalent goates; sacrificed, dyed; and
 escaping, resurrection; raised opportunely father,
 removed habitation men ascension.
 



christs kingdome world
 
much therefore, redeemeth, hath title thing
 redeemed, redemption, ransome paid; ransome was
 death redeemer; manifest, saviour (as man) was
 king redeemed, hee suffered death; is,
 time hee conversed bodily earth. say, not
 king present, vertue pact, faithfull make
 baptisme; neverthelesse, renewing pact with
 god baptisme, obliged obey king, (under his
 father) whensoever pleased take kingdome upon him.
 according whereunto, saviour expressely saith, (john 18.36.)
 "my kingdome world." now seeing scripture maketh
 mention two worlds; now, shall remain day
 judgment, (which therefore also called, last day;) that
 shall bee new heaven, new earth; kingdome christ
 begin till general resurrection. our
 saviour saith, (mat. 16.27.) "the man shall come glory
 father, angels; shall reward every man
 according works." reward every man according works, is
 execute office king; till come in
 glory father, angells. saviour saith,
 (mat. 23.2.) "the scribes pharisees sit moses seat; therefore
 whatsoever bid doe, observe doe;" hee declareth
 plainly, hee ascribeth kingly power, time, to
 himselfe, them. hee hath also, saith, (luke
 12.14.) "who made mee judge, divider you?" (john 12.47.)
 "i came judge world, save world." yet our
 saviour came world hee might bee king, judge in
 world come: hee messiah, is, christ, that
 is, anointed priest, soveraign prophet god; to
 say, power moses prophet, the
 high priests succeeded moses, kings succeeded the
 priests. st. john saies expressely (chap. 5. ver. 22.) "the father
 judgeth man, hath committed judgment son." is
 repugnant place, "i came judge world:" for
 spoken world present, world come; as
 also said, second coming christ, (mat. 19.
 28.) "yee followed regeneration, of
 man shall sit throne glory, yee shall also sit twelve
 thrones, judging twelve tribes israel."
 



end christs comming renew covenant kingdome
 god, perswade elect imbrace it, second
 part office
 
christ hee earth, kingdome world,
 end first coming? restore unto god, new
 covenant, kingdome, old covenant, been
 cut rebellion israelites election saul.
 doe, preach unto them, messiah, that
 is, king promised prophets; offer himselfe in
 sacrifice sinnes faith submit themselves
 thereto; case nation generally refuse him, call
 obedience beleeve amongst gentiles. so
 two parts saviours office aboad upon
 earth; one proclaim christ; another teaching,
 working miracles, perswade, prepare men live so, as
 worthy immortality beleevers enjoy, time as
 come majesty, take possession fathers kingdome.
 therefore is, time preaching, often himself
 called regeneration; properly kingdome, thereby
 warrant deny obedience magistrates were, (for
 hee commanded obey sate moses chaire, pay
 tribute caesar;) onely earnest kingdome god was
 come, god given grace disciples,
 beleeve him; cause godly said bee already
 kingdome grace, naturalized heavenly kingdome.
 



preaching christ contrary law jews, nor
 caesar
 
hitherto therefore nothing done, taught christ, that
 tendeth diminution civill right jewes, of
 caesar. touching common-wealth amongst
 jews, bare rule amongst them, were
 governed, expect messiah, kingdome god; they
 done laws forbidden (when came) to
 manifest, declare himself. seeing therefore nothing, by
 preaching, miracles go prove himselfe messiah,
 hee therein nothing laws. kingdome hee claimed was
 bee another world; taught men obey mean time them
 sate moses seat: allowed give caesar tribute, and
 refused take upon himselfe judg. words,
 actions bee seditious, tend overthrow civill
 government? god determined sacrifice, reduction
 elect former covenanted obedience, means,
 whereby bring effect, made use malice,
 ingratitude. contrary laws caesar. though
 pilate (to gratifie jews) delivered crucified; yet
 so, pronounced openly, found fault him:
 put title condemnation, jews required, "that
 pretended king;" simply, "that hee king jews;"
 notwithstanding clamour, refused alter it; saying, "what i
 written, written."
 



third part office king (under father) the
 elect
 
third part office, king, have
 already shewn kingdome begin till resurrection.
 shall king, onely god, sense is
 king already, ever shall be, earth, vertue his
 omnipotence; also peculiarly elect, vertue the
 pact make baptisme. therefore is, that
 saviour saith (mat. 19.28.) apostles sit upon twelve
 thrones, judging twelve tribes israel, "when man shall
 sit throne glory;" whereby signified should
 reign humane nature; (mat. 16.27.) "the man shall
 come glory father, angels, shall
 reward every man according works." may read, marke
 13..26. 14.26. expressely time, luke 22.29, 30. "i
 appoint unto kingdome, father hath appointed mee, that
 may eat drink table kingdome, sit thrones
 judging twelve tribes israel." manifest the
 kingdome christ appointed father, before
 man shall come glory, make apostles judges of
 twelve tribes israel. man may ask, seeing is
 marriage kingdome heaven, whether men shall eat, and
 drink; eating therefore meant place? expounded
 saviour (john 6.27.) saith, "labour meat
 perisheth, meat endureth unto everlasting
 life, man shall give you." eating christs
 table, meant eating tree life; say, the
 enjoying immortality, kingdome man. which
 places, many more, evident, saviours kingdome to
 bee exercised humane nature.
 



christs authority kingdome god subordinate father
 
again, king then, otherwise subordinate, or
 viceregent god father, moses wildernesse; as
 high priests reign saul; kings were
 it. one prophecies concerning christ, he
 like (in office) moses; "i will raise prophet
 (saith lord, deut. 18.18.) amongst brethren like unto
 thee, will put words mouth," similitude with
 moses, also apparent actions saviour himself, whilest
 conversant earth. moses chose twelve princes the
 tribes, govern him; saviour choose twelve apostles,
 shall sit twelve thrones, judge twelve tribes israel;
 moses authorized seventy elders, receive spirit god,
 prophecy people, is, (as said before,) to
 speak unto name god; saviour also ordained seventy
 disciples, preach kingdome, salvation nations. as
 complaint made moses, seventy that
 prophecyed camp israel, justified it, being
 subservient therein government; also saviour, st.
 john complained certain man cast devills his
 name, justified therein, saying, (luke 9.50.) "forbid not, for
 hee us, part."
 
again, saviour resembled moses institution sacraments,
 admission kingdome god, commemoration his
 deliverance elect miserable condition. children
 israel sacrament reception kingdome god,
 time moses, rite circumcision, rite having
 omitted wildernesse, restored soon came
 land promise; also jews, coming our
 saviour, rite baptizing, is, washing water all
 gentiles, embraced god israel. rite st.
 john baptist used reception gave names
 christ, hee preached bee already come world; and
 saviour instituted sacrament taken that
 beleeved him. cause rite baptisme first proceeded,
 expressed formally scripture; may probably
 thought imitation law moses, concerning leprousie;
 wherein leprous man commanded kept campe of
 israel certain time; time judged priest
 clean, hee admitted campe solemne washing.
 may therefore bee type washing baptisme; wherein
 men cleansed leprousie faith, received
 church solemnity baptisme. another
 conjecture drawn ceremonies gentiles, certain case
 rarely happens; is, man thought dead,
 chanced recover, men made scruple converse him, they
 doe converse ghost, unlesse hee received into
 number men, washing, children new born washed from
 uncleannesse nativity, kind new birth. this
 ceremony greeks, time judaea dominion
 alexander, greeks successors, may probably enough have
 crept religion jews. seeing likely our
 saviour countenance heathen rite, likely proceeded
 legall ceremony washing leprosie. other
 sacraments, eating paschall lambe, manifestly imitated in
 sacrament lords supper; breaking bread,
 pouring wine, keep memory deliverance from
 misery sin, christs passion, eating paschall
 lambe, kept memory deliverance jewes bondage of
 egypt. seeing therefore authority moses subordinate, and
 hee lieutenant god; followeth, christ, whose authority,
 man, bee like moses, subordinate to
 authority father. expressely signified, by
 hee teacheth us pray, "our father, let thy kingdome come;"
 and, "for thine kingdome, power glory;" that
 said, "hee shall come glory father;" by
 st. paul saith, (1 cor. 15.24.) "then commeth end, when
 hee shall delivered kingdome god, even father;" and
 many expresse places.
 



one god person represented moses, christ
 
saviour therefore, teaching, reigning, representeth (as
 moses did) person god; god time forward, but
 before, called father; still one same
 substance, one person represented moses, another person as
 represented sonne christ. person relative a
 representer, consequent plurality representers, there
 bee plurality persons, though one substance.
 


chapter xlii. power ecclesiasticall
 

understanding power ecclesiasticall, what, is,
 distinguish time ascension saviour, into
 two parts; one conversion kings, men endued with
 soveraign civill power; conversion. was
 long ascension, king, civill soveraign embraced,
 publiquely allowed teaching christian religion.
 



holy spirit fel apostles
 
time between, manifest, power
 ecclesiasticall, apostles; by
 ordained preach gospell, convert men christianity,
 direct converted way salvation; and
 power delivered others ordained,
 done imposition hands upon ordained; by
 signified giving holy spirit, spirit god, to
 ordained ministers god, advance kingdome.
 imposition hands, nothing else seal their
 commission preach christ, teach doctrine; giving of
 holy ghost ceremony imposition hands, imitation
 moses did. moses used ceremony his
 minister joshua, wee read deuteronomy 34. ver. 9. "and joshua son
 nun full spirit wisdome; moses laid his
 hands upon him." saviour therefore resurrection, and
 ascension, gave spirit apostles; first, "breathing on
 them, saying," (john 20.22.) "receive yee holy spirit;" after
 ascension (acts 2.2, 3.) sending upon them, "mighty wind,
 cloven tongues fire;" imposition hands; neither
 god lay hands moses; apostles afterward, transmitted
 spirit imposition hands, moses joshua. that
 manifest hereby, power ecclesiasticall continually
 remained, first times, christian
 common-wealth; namely, received apostles,
 successive laying hands.
 



trinity
 
wee person god born now third time. moses,
 high priests, gods representative old testament;
 saviour himselfe man, abode earth: holy
 ghost, say, apostles, successors, office
 preaching, teaching, received holy spirit, have
 represented ever since. person, (as shewn before,
 [chapt. 16.].) represented, often hee is
 represented; therefore god, represented (that is,
 personated) thrice, may properly enough said three persons;
 though neither word person, trinity ascribed the
 bible. st. john indeed (1 epist. 5.7.) saith, "there three bear
 witnesse heaven, father, word, holy spirit; these
 three one:" disagreeth not, accordeth fitly three
 persons proper signification persons; is, is
 represented another. god father, represented moses,
 one person; represented sonne, another person, as
 represented apostles, doctors taught authority
 derived, third person; yet every person here, is
 person one god. man may ask, was
 whereof three bare witnesse. st. john therefore tells us (verse
 11.) bear witnesse, "god hath given us eternall life
 son." again, asked, wherein testimony
 appeareth, answer easie; hath testified the
 miracles wrought, first moses; secondly, himself; and
 lastly apostles, received holy spirit; which
 times represented person god; either prophecyed, or
 preached jesus christ. apostles, character
 apostleship, twelve first great apostles, bear
 witnesse resurrection; appeareth expressely (acts 1. ver.
 21,22.) st peter, new apostle chosen place
 judas iscariot, useth words, "of men companied
 us time lord jesus went amongst us,
 beginning baptisme john, unto day hee was
 taken us, must one bee ordained witnesse us his
 resurrection:" words interpret bearing witnesse, mentioned
 st. john. place mentioned another trinity of
 witnesses earth. (ver. 8.) saith, "there three bear
 witnesse earth, spirit, water, bloud; these
 three agree one:" say, graces gods spirit, the
 two sacraments, baptisme, lords supper, agree one
 testimony, assure consciences beleevers, eternall life; of
 testimony saith (verse 10.) "he beleeveth of
 man hath witnesse himselfe." trinity earth unity
 thing; spirit, water, bloud, not
 substance, though give testimony: the
 trinity heaven, persons persons one god,
 though represented three different times occasions. conclude,
 doctrine trinity, far can gathered directly from
 scripture, substance this; god alwaies one the
 same, person represented moses; person represented by
 incarnate; person represented apostles. as
 represented apostles, holy spirit spake, is
 god; represented (that god man), that
 god; represented moses, high priests, father, is
 say, father lord jesus christ, god: whence
 may gather reason names father, son, holy spirit in
 signification godhead, never used old testament:
 persons, is, names representing;
 be, till divers men represented gods person in
 ruling, directing him.
 
thus wee see power ecclesiasticall left saviour
 apostles; (to end might better
 exercise power,) endued holy spirit, therefore
 called sometime new testament paracletus signifieth an
 assister, one called helpe, though bee commonly translated
 comforter. let us now consider power selfe, was, and
 whom.
 



power ecclesiasticall power teach
 
cardinall bellarmine third generall controversie, hath handled a
 great many questions concerning ecclesiasticall power pope
 rome; begins this, whether monarchicall,
 aristocraticall, democraticall. sorts power, are
 soveraign, coercive. now appear, no
 coercive power left saviour; onely power proclaim
 kingdom christ, perswade men submit themselves
 thereunto; precepts good counsell, teach have
 submitted, do, may received the
 kingdom god comes; apostles, ministers
 gospel, schoolemasters, commanders, their
 precepts laws, wholesome counsells dispute in
 vain.
 



argument thereof, power christ himself
 
shewn already (in last chapter,) kingdome christ
 world: therefore neither can ministers (unlesse they
 kings,) require obedience name. supreme king, have
 regall power world; authority can obedience be
 required officers? father sent me, (so saith saviour)
 send you. saviour sent perswade jews return to,
 invite gentiles, receive kingdome father, and
 reign majesty, not, fathers lieutenant, till day
 judgment.
 



name regeneration
 
time ascension, generall resurrection, is
 called, reigning, regeneration; is, preparation
 men second glorious coming christ, day of
 judgment; appeareth words saviour, mat. 19.28. "you
 followed regeneration, man shall sit
 throne glory, shall also sit upon twelve thrones;" and
 st. paul (ephes. 6.15.) "having feet shod preparation
 gospell peace."
 



comparison it, fishing, leaven, seed
 
compared saviour, fishing; is, winning men
 obedience, coercion, punishing; perswasion: and
 therefore said apostles, hee make many
 nimrods, hunters men; fishers men. compared also to
 leaven; sowing seed, multiplication grain of
 mustard-seed; compulsion excluded; consequently
 can time actual reigning. work christs
 ministers, evangelization; is, proclamation christ, and
 preparation second comming; evangelization john
 baptist, preparation first coming.
 



nature faith:
 
again, office christs ministers world, make men
 beleeve, faith christ: faith hath relation to, nor
 dependence upon compulsion, commandement; onely upon
 certainty, probability arguments drawn reason, from
 something men beleeve already. therefore ministers christ this
 world, power title, punish man beleeving,
 contradicting say; say power that
 title christs ministers, punish such: soveraign
 civill power, politick institution, may indeed lawfully
 punish contradiction laws whatsoever: st. paul, of
 himselfe preachers gospell saith expresse
 words, (2 cor. 1.24.) "wee dominion faith, are
 helpers joy."
 



authority christ hath left civill princes
 
another argument, ministers christ present world
 right commanding, may drawn lawfull authority
 christ hath left princes, well christians, infidels.
 st. paul saith (col. 3.20.) "children obey parents things;
 well pleasing lord." ver. 22. "servants obey in
 things masters according flesh, eye-service, as
 men-pleasers, singlenesse heart, fearing lord;" is
 spoken whose masters infidells; yet bidden
 obey things. again, concerning obedience princes.
 (rom. 13. first 6. verses) exhorting "be subject higher
 powers," saith, "that power ordained god;" "that we
 subject them, onely for" fear incurring their
 "wrath, also conscience sake." st. peter, (1 epist. chap. 2e
 ver. 13, 14, 15.) "submit selves every ordinance man, the
 lords sake, whether bee king, supreme, unto governours,
 sent punishment evill doers, and
 praise doe well; will god."
 st. paul (tit. 3.1.) "put men mind subject to
 principalities, powers, obey magistrates." princes, and
 powers, whereof st. peter, st. paul speak, infidels;
 much therefore obey christians, god hath
 ordained soveraign power us. can wee obliged
 doe thing contrary command king, soveraign
 representant common-wealth, whereof members, whom
 look protected? therefore manifest, christ hath not
 left ministers world, unlesse also endued with
 civill authority, authority command men.
 



christians may avoid persecution
 
(may object) king, senate, soveraign
 person forbid us beleeve christ? answer, such
 forbidding effect, beleef, unbeleef never follow
 mens commands. faith gift god, man can neither give, nor
 take away promise rewards, menaces torture. be
 asked, wee bee commanded lawfull prince, say
 tongue, wee beleeve not; must obey command? profession
 tongue externall thing, other
 gesture whereby signifie obedience; wherein christian,
 holding firmely heart faith christ, hath liberty
 prophet elisha allowed naaman syrian. naaman was
 converted heart god israel; hee saith (2 kings
 5.17.) "thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering, nor
 sacrifice unto gods unto lord. thing lord
 pardon thy servant, master goeth house rimmon
 worship there, leaneth hand, bow selfe the
 house rimmon; bow selfe house rimmon, lord
 pardon thy servant thing." prophet approved, bid
 "goe peace." naaman beleeved heart; bowing
 idol rimmon, denyed true god effect, much as
 done lips. shall answer our
 saviours saying, "whosoever denyeth men, will deny him
 father heaven?" may say, whatsoever
 subject, naaman was, compelled obedience soveraign,
 doth order mind, order laws of
 country, action his, soveraigns; he
 case denyeth christ men, governour, the
 law countrey. man shall accuse doctrine, repugnant
 true, unfeigned christianity; ask him, case be
 subject christian common-wealth, inwardly his
 heart mahometan religion, whether soveraign command to
 bee present divine service christian church, on
 pain death, think mamometan obliged conscience suffer
 death cause, rather obey command lawful
 prince. say, rather suffer death, authorizeth
 private men, disobey princes, maintenance their
 religion, true, false; say, bee obedient, he
 alloweth himself, hee denyeth another, contrary the
 words saviour, "whatsoever men doe unto
 you, doe yee unto them;" contrary law nature, (which
 indubitable everlasting law god) "do another, that
 thou wouldest doe unto thee."
 



martyrs
 
shall say martyrs read the
 history church, needlessely cast away lives?
 answer hereunto, distinguish persons been
 cause put death; whereof received calling to
 preach, professe kingdome christ openly; others no
 calling, required owne faith.
 former sort, put death, bearing witnesse to
 point, jesus christ risen dead, true martyrs;
 martyr is, (to give true definition word) witnesse of
 resurrection jesus messiah; none can those
 conversed earth, saw risen: a
 witnesse must seen testifieth, else testimony not
 good. none such, can properly called martyrs christ,
 manifest words st. peter, act. 1.21, 22. "wherefore of
 men companyed us time lord jesus
 went amongst us, beginning baptisme john unto
 day hee taken us, must one ordained a
 martyr (that witnesse) us resurrection:" we
 may observe, bee witnesse truth of
 resurrection christ, say, truth this
 fundamentall article christian religion, jesus christ,
 must disciple conversed him, saw before, and
 resurrection; consequently must one originall
 disciples: whereas so, can witnesse more, but
 antecessors said it, therefore witnesses of
 mens testimony; second martyrs, martyrs christs
 witnesses.
 
he, maintain every doctrine draweth of
 history saviours life, acts, epistles the
 apostles; beleeveth upon authority private man,
 wil oppose laws authority civill state, far from
 martyr christ, martyr martyrs. ’tis one article
 onely, die for, meriteth honorable name; article
 this, jesus christ; say, hath redeemed
 us, shall come give us salvation, eternall life his
 glorious kingdome. die every tenet serveth ambition,
 profit clergy, required; death the
 witnesse, testimony self makes martyr: word
 signifieth nothing else, man beareth witnesse, whether he
 put death testimony, not.
 
also sent preach fundamentall article, taketh
 upon private authority, though witnesse, and
 consequently martyr, either primary christ, secondary his
 apostles, disciples, successors; yet obliged to
 suffer death cause; called thereto, tis
 required hands; hee complain, loseth
 reward expecteth never set work. none
 therefore can martyr, neither first, second degree, that
 warrant preach christ come flesh; say,
 none, sent conversion infidels. man
 witnesse already beleeveth, therefore needs no
 witnesse; deny, doubt, heard it. christ
 sent apostles, seventy disciples, authority preach;
 sent beleeved: sent unbeleevers; "i send
 (saith he) sheep amongst wolves;" sheep sheep.
 



argument points commission
 
lastly points commission, expressely set down
 gospel, contain none authority congregation.
 



preach
 
first (mat. 10.) twelve apostles sent "to the
 lost sheep house israel," commanded preach, "that the
 kingdome god hand." now preaching originall, that
 act, crier, herald, officer useth doe publiquely in
 proclaiming king. crier hath right command man.
 (luke 10.2.) seventy disciples sent out, "as labourers,
 lords harvest;" bidden (verse 9.) say, "the
 kingdome god come nigh unto you;" kingdome meant,
 kingdome grace, kingdome glory; are
 bidden denounce (ver. 11.) cities shall receive
 them, threatning, shall tolerable day for
 sodome, city. (mat. 20.28.) saviour telleth his
 disciples, sought priority place, office minister,
 even man came, ministred unto, minister.
 preachers therefore magisteriall, ministeriall power: "bee
 called masters, (saith saviour, mat. 23.10) one your
 master, even christ."
 



teach
 
another point commission, is, teach nations; in
 mat. 28.19. st. mark 16.15 "goe world, preach
 gospel every creature." teaching therefore, preaching the
 thing. proclaim comming king, must withall
 make known right commeth, mean men shall submit
 unto him: st. paul jews thessalonica,
 "three sabbath days reasoned scriptures,
 opening, alledging christ must needs suffered, risen
 dead, jesus christ." teach out
 old testament jesus christ, (that say, king,)
 risen dead, say, men bound they
 beleeve it, obey tell so, laws, and
 commands soveraigns; shall doe wisely, expect
 coming christ hereafter, patience, faith, obedience
 present magistrates.
 



baptize;
 
another point commission, baptize, "in name of
 father, son, holy ghost." baptisme?
 dipping water. dip man water the
 name thing? meaning words baptisme this. he
 baptized, dipped washed, sign becomming new man,
 loyall subject god, whose person represented old
 time moses, high priests, reigned jews; and
 jesus christ, sonne, god, man, hath redeemed us, and
 shall humane nature represent fathers person eternall
 kingdome resurrection; acknowledge doctrine the
 apostles, assisted spirit father, son, were
 left guides bring us kingdome, onely, and
 assured way thereunto. this, promise baptisme; the
 authority earthly soveraigns put till day of
 judgment; (for expressely affirmed s. paul 1 cor. 15. 22, 23,
 24. saith, "as adam die, christ shall be
 made alive. every man owne order, christ first fruits,
 afterward christs, comming; commeth end,
 shall delivered kingdome god, even father,
 shall put rule, authority power")
 manifest, baptisme constitute us another
 authority, externall actions governed this
 life; promise take doctrine apostles direction
 way life eternall.
 



forgive, retain sinnes
 
power remission, retention sinnes, called also power
 loosing, binding, sometimes keyes kingdome of
 heaven, consequence authority baptize, refuse to
 baptize. baptisme sacrament allegeance, are
 received kingdome god; say, eternall
 life; say, remission sin: eternall life lost
 committing, recovered remitting mens sins. the
 end baptisme remission sins: therefore st. peter, they
 converted sermon day pentecost, asked what
 doe, advised "repent, baptized name
 jesus, remission sins." therefore seeing baptize
 declare reception men gods kingdome; refuse to
 baptize declare exclusion; followeth, power
 declare cast out, retained it, given same
 apostles, substitutes, successors. therefore our
 saviour breathed upon them, saying, (john 20.22.) "receive holy
 ghost," hee addeth next verse, "whose soever sins ye remit,
 remitted unto them; whose soever sins ye retain, are
 retained." words, granted authority forgive, or
 retain sins, simply absolutely, god forgiveth retaineth them,
 knoweth heart man, truth penitence conversion;
 conditionally, penitent: forgivenesse, or
 absolution, case absolved feigned repentance, is
 thereby without act, sentence absolvent, made void,
 hath effect salvation, contrary, the
 aggravation sin. therefore apostles, successors,
 follow outward marks repentance; appearing, they
 authority deny absolution; appeare not, have
 authority absolve. also observed baptisme:
 converted jew, gentile, apostles power to
 deny baptisme; grant un-penitent. seeing man is
 able discern truth another mans repentance, by
 externall marks, taken words, actions, subject to
 hypocrisie; another question will arise, constituted
 judge marks. question decided saviour
 himself; (mat. 18. 15, 16, 17.) "if thy brother (saith he) shall
 trespasse thee, go tell fault thee, him
 alone; shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. he
 will hear thee, take thee one, two more. he
 shall neglect hear them, tell unto church, let unto
 thee heathen man, publican." manifest, that
 judgment concerning truth repentance, belonged one
 man, church, is, assembly faithfull, or
 authority bee representant. besides the
 judgment, necessary also pronouncing sentence: and
 belonged alwaies apostle, pastor church,
 prolocutor; saviour speaketh 18 verse,
 "whatsoever ye shall bind earth, shall bound heaven; and
 whatsoever ye shall loose earth, shall loosed heaven." and
 comformable hereunto practise st. paul (1 cor. 5.3, 4, & 5.)
 saith, "for verily, absent body, present spirit,
 determined already, though present, concerning that
 hath done deed; name lord jesus christ ye
 gathered together, spirit, power lord jesus
 christ, deliver one satan;" say, cast him
 church, man whose sins forgiven. paul here
 pronounceth sentence; assembly first hear cause,
 (for st. paul absent;) consequence condemn him. in
 chapter (ver. 11, 12.) judgment case more
 expressely attributed assembly: "but now written unto
 you, keep company, man called brother a
 fornicator, &c. one eat. to
 judg without? ye judg within?"
 sentence therefore man put church, was
 pronounced apostle, pastor; judgment concerning the
 merit cause, church; say, (as times
 conversion kings, men soveraign
 authority common-wealth,) assembly christians dwelling
 city; corinth, assembly christians of
 corinth.
 



excommunication
 
part power keyes, men thrust from
 kingdome god, called excommunication; to
 excommunicate, originall, aposunagogon poiein, cast of
 synagogue; is, place divine service; word drawn
 custom jews, cast synagogues, as
 thought manners, doctrine, contagious, lepers the
 law moses separated congregation israel, till time
 priest pronounced clean.
 



use excommunication without civill power.
 
use effect excommunication, whilest yet
 strengthened civill power, more, they, who
 excommunicate, avoid company were.
 enough repute heathen, never been
 christians; might eate, drink; with
 excommunicate persons might do; appeareth words of
 st. paul, (1 cor. 5. ver. 9, 10, &c.) telleth them, had
 formerly forbidden "company fornicators;" (because that
 bee without going world,) restraineth such
 fornicators, otherwise vicious persons, brethren;
 "with one" (he saith) keep company, "no, to
 eat." saviour saith (mat. 18.17.) "let
 thee heathen, publican." publicans (which
 signifieth farmers, receivers revenue common-wealth)
 hated, detested jews pay it, as
 publican sinner taken amongst thing:
 insomuch, saviour accepted invitation zacchaeus a
 publican; though convert him, yet objected as
 crime. therefore, saviour, heathen, added publican, he
 forbid eat man excommunicate.
 
keeping synagogues, places assembly, they
 power it, owner place, whether he
 christian, heathen. places right, the
 dominion common-wealth; well hee excommunicated, as
 hee never baptized, might enter commission from
 civill magistrate; paul conversion entred their
 synagogues damascus, (acts 9.2.) apprehend christians, men and
 women, carry bound jerusalem, commission high
 priest.
 



effect upon apostate
 
appears, upon christian, become an
 apostate, place civill power persecute, assist
 church, effect excommunication nothing it, neither of
 dammage world, terrour: terrour, their
 unbeleef; dammage, returned thereby favour
 world; world come, worse estate,
 never beleeved. dammage redounded rather the
 church, provocation cast out, freer execution of
 malice.
 



upon faithfull only
 
excommunication therefore effect onely upon those, beleeved
 jesus christ come glory, reign over, to
 judge quick, dead, therefore refuse entrance
 kingdom, whose sins retained; is, those
 excommunicated church. thence st. paul
 calleth excommunication, delivery excommunicate person to
 satan. without kingdom christ, kingdomes after
 judgment, comprehended kingdome satan. the
 faithfull stood fear of, long stood excommunicate, is
 say, estate wherein sins forgiven. whereby wee
 may understand, excommunication time christian religion
 authorized civill power, used onely correction
 manners, errours opinion: punishment, whereof
 none sensible beleeved, expected coming
 saviour judge world; beleeved,
 needed opinion, onely uprightnesse life, saved.
 



fault lyeth excommunication
 
lyeth excommunication injustice; (mat. 18.) thy brother
 offend thee, tell privately; witnesses; lastly, tell
 church; obey not, "let thee heathen
 man, publican." lyeth excommunication scandalous
 life, (1 cor. 5. 11.) "if man called brother, be
 fornicator, covetous, idolater, drunkard, an
 extortioner, one yee eat." excommunicate a
 man held foundation, jesus christ, difference
 opinion points, foundation destroyed,
 appeareth authority scripture, example the
 apostles. indeed st. paul (titus 3.10.) text seemeth
 contrary. "a man haeretique, first
 second admonition, reject." haeretique, he, a
 member church, teacheth neverthelesse private opinion, which
 church forbidden: one, s. paul adviseth titus, after
 first, second admonition, reject. reject (in this
 place) excommunicate man; give admonishing
 him, let alone, set disputing him, one to
 convinced onely himselfe. apostle saith (2 tim. 2.23.)
 "foolish unlearned questions avoid;" word avoid place,
 reject former, originall, paraitou: but
 foolish questions may bee set without excommunication. again,
 (tit. 3.93) "avoid foolish questions," originall, periistaso,
 (set by) equivalent former word reject. no
 place can much colourably drawn, countenance
 casting church faithfull men, beleeved the
 foundation, onely singular superstructure own, proceeding
 perhaps good & pious conscience. contrary, such
 places command avoiding disputes, written lesson to
 pastors, (such timothy titus were) make new articles of
 faith, determining every small controversie, oblige men a
 needlesse burthen conscience, provoke break union of
 church. lesson apostles observed well. s. peter
 s. paul, though controversie great, (as may read
 gal. 2.11.) yet cast one another church.
 neverthelesse, apostles time, pastors that
 observed not; diotrephes (3 john 9. &c.) cast the
 church, s. john thought fit received it, out
 pride took praeeminence; early was, vainglory, and
 ambition found entrance church christ.
 



persons liable excommunication
 
man liable excommunication, many conditions
 requisite; first, member commonalty, to
 say, lawfull assembly, say, christian
 church, hath power judge cause hee to
 bee excommunicated. community, can bee no
 excommunication; power judge, can bee any
 power give sentence. hence followeth, one church cannot
 excommunicated another: either equall power
 excommunicate other, case excommunication not
 discipline, act authority, schisme, dissolution of
 charity; one subordinate other, both
 one voice, one church; part
 excommunicated, church, dissolute number of
 individuall persons.
 
sentence excommunication, importeth advice, to
 keep company, much eat excommunicate, if
 soveraign prince, assembly bee excommunicate, sentence no
 effect. subjects bound company presence of
 soveraign (when requireth it) law nature; nor
 can lawfully either expell place dominion,
 whether profane holy; go dominion, without leave;
 much lesse (if call honour,) refuse eat him. and
 princes states, parts one and
 congregation, need sentence keep
 keeping company state excommunicate: the
 institution, uniteth many men one community; it
 dissociateth one community another: excommunication is
 needfull keeping kings states asunder; further
 effect nature policy selfe; unlesse to
 instigate princes warre upon one another.
 
excommunication christian subject, obeyeth laws
 soveraign, whether christian, heathen, effect. for
 beleeve "jesus christ, hath spirit god" (1
 joh. 4.1.) "and god dwelleth him, god," (1 joh. 4.15.) but
 hee hath spirit god; hee dwelleth god; hee in
 god dwelleth, can receive harm excommunication men.
 therefore, beleeveth jesus christ, free all
 dangers threatned persons excommunicate. beleeveth it
 not, christian. therefore true unfeigned christian not
 liable excommunication; also professed christian,
 till hypocrisy appear manners, is, till behaviour
 bee contrary law soveraign, rule manners,
 christ apostles commanded us subject to.
 church judge manners externall actions, which
 actions can never bee unlawfull, law of
 common-wealth.
 
mans father, mother, master bee excommunicate, yet not
 children forbidden keep company, eat them; for
 (for part) oblige eat all, want
 means get food; authorise disobey parents,
 masters, contrary precept apostles.
 
summe, power excommunication extended than
 end apostles pastors church have
 commission saviour; rule command and
 coaction, teaching direction men way salvation
 world come. master science, may abandon his
 scholar, hee obstinately neglecteth practise rules; but
 accuse injustice, never bound obey him:
 teacher christian doctrine may abandon disciples that
 obstinately continue unchristian life; say, doe
 wrong, obliged obey him: teacher
 shall complain, may applyed answer god samuel in
 like place, (1 sam. 8.) "they rejected thee, mee."
 excommunication therefore wanteth assistance civill
 power, doth, christian state, prince excommunicate
 forain authority, without effect; consequently to
 without terrour. name fulmen excommunicationis (that is, the
 thunderbolt excommunication) proceeded imagination the
 bishop rome, first used it, king kings, the
 heathen made jupiter king gods; assigned poems,
 pictures, thunderbolt, wherewith subdue, punish giants,
 dare deny power: imagination grounded on
 two errours; one, kingdome christ world, contrary
 saviours owne words, "my kingdome world;" the
 other, hee christs vicar, onely owne subjects,
 christians world; whereof ground in
 scripture, contrary shall bee proved due place.
 



interpreter scriptures civill soveraigns became
 christians
 
st. paul coming thessalonica, synagogue jews,
 (acts 17.2, 3.) "as manner was, went unto them, three sabbath
 dayes reasoned scriptures, opening alledging,
 christ must needs suffered risen dead; and
 jesus preached christ." scriptures here
 mentioned scriptures jews, is, old testament.
 men, prove jesus christ, risen
 dead, also jews, beleeve already, that
 word god. hereupon (as verse 4.) them
 beleeved, (as 5. ver.) beleeved not. was
 reason, beleeved scripture, not
 beleeve alike; approved, others disapproved the
 interpretation st. paul cited them; every one interpreted
 himself? this; s. paul came without legall
 commission, manner one command, but
 perswade; must needs do, either miracles, moses did
 israelites egypt, might see authority gods
 works; reasoning already received scripture, that
 might see truth doctrine gods word. whosoever
 perswadeth reasoning principles written, maketh hee
 speaketh judge, meaning principles, also the
 force inferences upon them. jews thessalonica were
 not, else judge s. paul alledged scripture?
 s. paul, needed quote places prove doctrine? it
 enough said, find scripture, to
 say, laws, interpreter, sent christ. the
 interpreter therefore scripture, whose interpretation the
 jews thessalonica bound stand, none: every one might
 beleeve, beleeve, according allegations seemed himselfe
 agreeable, agreeable meaning places alledged.
 generally cases world, hee pretendeth proofe,
 maketh judge proofe addresseth speech. as
 case jews particular, bound expresse words
 (deut. 17.) receive determination hard questions, from
 priests judges israel time being. bee
 understood jews yet unconverted.
 
conversion gentiles, use alledging the
 scriptures, beleeved not. apostles therefore laboured by
 reason confute idolatry; done, perswade the
 faith christ, testimony life, resurrection. so
 yet bee controversie concerning authority
 interpret scripture; seeing man obliged infidelity,
 follow mans interpretation scripture, except his
 soveraigns interpretation laws countrey.
 
let us now consider conversion self, see was
 therein, cause obligation. men converted
 thing beleef apostles
 preached: apostles preached nothing, jesus the
 christ, say, king save them, reign over
 eternally world come; consequently hee not
 dead, risen dead, gone heaven, should
 come one day judg world, (which also rise to
 judged,) reward every man according works. none them
 preached himselfe, apostle interpreter
 scripture, became christians, take their
 interpretation law. interpret laws, part the
 administration present kingdome; apostles not. they
 prayed then, pastors ever since, "let thy kingdome come;"
 exhorted converts obey ethnique princes. new
 testament yet published one body. every evangelists
 interpreter gospel; every apostle epistle;
 old testament, saviour himselfe saith jews (john
 5. 39.) "search scriptures; yee thinke eternall
 life, testifie me." hee meant they
 interpret them, hee bidden take thence the
 proof christ; either interpreted them
 himselfe, referred interpretation priests.
 
difficulty arose, apostles elders church assembled
 together, determined bee preached, and
 taught, interpret scriptures people;
 took people liberty read, interpret to
 themselves. apostles sent divers letters churches, other
 writings instruction; vain, not
 allowed interpret, is, consider meaning them.
 apostles time, must till time as
 pastors, authorise interpreter, whose
 interpretation generally stood to: till
 kings pastors, pastors kings.
 



power make scripture law
 
two senses, wherein writing may said canonicall;
 canon, signifieth rule; rule precept, man
 guided, directed action whatsoever. precepts, though
 given teacher disciple, counsellor friend,
 without power compell observe them, neverthelesse canons;
 rules: given one, that
 receiveth bound obey, canons, onely rules,
 laws: question therefore here, power make the
 scriptures (which rules christian faith) laws.
 



ten commandements
 
part scripture, first law, ten
 commandements, written two tables stone, delivered god
 himselfe moses; moses made known people. that
 time written law god, yet chosen any
 people bee peculiar kingdome, given law men, the
 law nature, say, precepts naturall reason, written
 every mans heart. two tables, first containeth the
 law soveraignty; 1. obey, honour gods of
 nations, words, "non habebis deos alienos coram me," that
 is, "thou shalt gods, gods nations worship;
 onely me:" whereby forbidden obey, honor, their
 king governour, god, spake unto by
 moses, afterwards high priest. 2. "should make
 image represent him;" say, choose to
 themselves, neither heaven, earth, representative their
 fancying, obey moses aaron, appointed that
 office. 3. "they take name god vain;" is,
 speak rashly king, dispute right,
 commissions moses aaron, lieutenants. 4. "they
 every seventh day abstain ordinary labour," employ
 time publique honor. second table containeth the
 duty one man towards another, "to honor parents; kill;
 commit adultery; steale; corrupt judgment false
 witnesse;" finally, "not much designe heart the
 injury one another." question now is, was
 gave written tables obligatory force lawes. there
 doubt made laws god himselfe: a
 law obliges not, law any, acknowledge to
 act soveraign, people israel were
 forbidden approach mountain hear god said moses, be
 obliged obedience laws moses propounded them?
 indeed laws nature, second table;
 therefore acknowledged gods laws; israelites
 alone, people: peculiar the
 israelites, first table, question remains; saving
 obliged themselves, presently propounding of
 them, obey moses, words (exod. 20.19.) "speak thou to
 us, will hear thee; let god speak us, lest die." it
 therefore onely moses then, high priest, (by
 moses) god declared administer peculiar kingdome, that
 earth, power make short scripture decalogue
 bee law common-wealth israel. moses, aaron, the
 succeeding high priests civill soveraigns. therefore hitherto,
 canonizing, making scripture law, belonged civill
 soveraigne.
 



judicial, leviticall law
 
judiciall law, say, laws god prescribed the
 magistrates israel, rule administration justice,
 sentences, judgments pronounce, pleas
 man man; leviticall law, say, rule
 god prescribed touching rites ceremonies priests and
 levites, delivered moses onely; therefore also
 became lawes, vertue promise obedience moses.
 whether laws written, written, dictated to
 people moses (after forty dayes god mount)
 word mouth, expressed text; all
 positive laws, equivalent holy scripture, made canonicall by
 moses civill soveraign.
 



second law
 
israelites come plains moab against
 jericho, ready enter land promise, moses the
 former laws added divers others; therefore called deuteronomy:
 is, second laws. (as written, deut. 29.1.) "the words
 covenant lord commanded moses make children
 israel, besides covenant made horeb." for
 explained former laws, beginning book of
 deuteronomy, addeth others, begin 12. cha. continue
 end 26. book. law (deut. 27.1.) were
 commanded write upon great stones playstered over, passing
 jordan: law also written moses book; and
 delivered hands "priests, elders israel,"
 (deut. 31.9.) commanded (ve. 26.) "to put side the
 arke;" ark selfe nothing ten commandements.
 law, moses (deuteronomy 17.18.) commanded kings
 israel keep copie of: law, been
 long time lost, found temple time josiah,
 authority received law god. moses the
 writing, josiah recovery thereof, the
 civill soveraignty. hitherto therefore power making scripture
 canonicall, civill soveraign.
 
besides book law, book, time of
 moses, till captivity, received amongst jews the
 law god. prophets (except few) lived time the
 captivity selfe; rest lived little it; were
 far prophecies generally received laws, that
 persons persecuted, partly false prophets, partly by
 kings seduced them. book self, was
 confirmed josiah law god, history of
 works god, lost captivity, sack city of
 jerusalem, appears 2 esdras 14.21. "thy law burnt;
 therefor man knoweth things done thee, works
 shall begin." captivity, time the
 law lost, (which mentioned scripture, may probably
 thought time rehoboam, shishak king egypt took
 spoils temple,(1 kings 14.26.)) time josiah,
 found againe, written word god, ruled
 according discretion, direction such, each
 esteemed prophets.
 



old testament, made canonicall
 
whence may inferre, scriptures old testament,
 day, canonicall, law unto jews,
 till renovation covenant god return the
 captivity, restauration common-wealth esdras. but
 time forward accounted law jews, for
 translated greek seventy elders judaea, put the
 library ptolemy alexandria, approved word god. now
 seeing esdras high priest, high priest civill
 soveraigne, manifest, scriptures never made laws,
 soveraign civill power.
 
new testament began canonicall christian soveraigns by
 writings fathers lived time christian
 religion received, authorised constantine emperour, we
 may find, books wee now new testament, held by
 christians time (except few, respect whose paucity
 rest called catholique church, others haeretiques) for
 dictates holy ghost; consequently canon, rule
 faith: reverence opinion teachers;
 generally reverence disciples bear first
 masters, manner doctrine receive them, small.
 therefore doubt, s. paul wrote churches he
 converted; apostle, disciple christ, those
 embraced christ, received writings for
 true christian doctrine. time, power and
 authority teacher, faith hearer caused them
 receive it, apostles made writings
 canonicall, every convert made himself.
 
question here, christian made law, canon
 himself, (which might reject, right received
 it;) made canon them, without injustice they
 doe thing contrary thereunto. new testament
 sense canonicall, say, law place
 law common-wealth made so, contrary to
 nature law. law, (as hath already shewn) the
 commandement man, assembly, given soveraign
 authority, make rules direction actions, hee
 shall think fit; punish us, doe thing contrary the
 same. therefore man shall offer unto us rules,
 soveraign ruler hath prescribed, counsell,
 advice; which, whether good, bad, hee counselled, may
 without injustice refuse observe, contrary laws
 already established, without injustice observe, good soever
 conceiveth be. say, case observe same
 actions, discourse men; though may
 without blame beleeve private teachers, wish the
 liberty practise advice; publiquely received
 law. internall faith nature invisible, and
 consequently exempted humane jurisdiction; whereas words,
 actions proceed it, breaches civil obedience,
 injustice god man. seeing saviour hath
 denyed kingdome world, seeing hath said, came
 judge, save world, hath subjected us other
 laws common-wealth; is, jews law
 moses, (which saith (mat. 5.) came destroy, to
 fulfill,) nations laws severall soveraigns,
 men laws nature; observing whereof, he
 himselfe, apostles teaching recommended us, as
 necessary condition admitted last day his
 eternall kingdome, wherein shall protection, life everlasting.
 seeing saviour, apostles, left new laws oblige
 us world, new doctrine prepare us next; books
 new testament, containe doctrine, untill obedience to
 commanded, god hath given power earth be
 legislators, obligatory canons, is, laws, onely good,
 safe advice, direction sinners way salvation,
 every man might take, refuse owne perill, without
 injustice.
 
again, saviour christs commission apostles, disciples,
 proclaim kingdome (not present, but) come; teach
 nations; baptize beleeve; enter into
 houses receive them; not
 received, shake dust feet them; not
 call fire heaven destroy them, compell to
 obedience sword. nothing power, of
 perswasion. sent sheep unto wolves, kings their
 subjects. commission make laws; obey, and
 teach obedience laws made; consequently make their
 writings obligatory canons, without help soveraign civill
 power. therefore scripture new testament only
 law, lawfull civill power hath made so. also the
 king, soveraign, maketh law himself; subjecteth
 himselfe, doctor, apostle, converted him, god
 himself, jesus christ, immediately apostles
 themselves.
 



power councells make scripture law
 
may seem give new testament, respect that
 embraced christian doctrine, force laws, times, and
 places persecution, decrees made amongst in
 synods. read (acts 15.28.) stile councell the
 apostles, elders, whole church, manner, "it seemed
 good holy ghost, us, lay upon greater burthen
 necessary things, &c." stile signifieth a
 power lay burthen received doctrine. now
 "to lay burthen another," seemeth "to oblige;" and
 therefore acts councell laws christians.
 neverthelesse, laws precepts,
 "repent, baptized; keep commandements; beleeve gospel; come
 unto me; sell thou hast; give poor;" "follow
 me;" commands, invitations, callings men to
 christianity, like esay 55.1. "ho, every man thirsteth,
 come yee waters, come, buy wine milke without money."
 first, apostles power saviour,
 invite men embrace kingdome god; themselves
 acknowledged kingdome (not present, but) come; that
 kingdome, can make laws. secondly, acts of
 councell, laws, without disobeyed. we
 read where, received doctrine christ,
 therein sin; died sins; is, their
 sins laws owed obedience, pardoned.
 laws laws nature, civill laws the
 state, whereto every christian man pact submitted himself. and
 therefore burthen, apostles might lay they
 converted, understood laws, conditions, proposed
 sought salvation; might accept, refuse at
 perill, without new sin, though without hazard of
 condemned, excluded kingdome god sins
 past. therefore infidels, s. john saith not, wrath god
 shall "come" upon them, "the wrath god remaineth upon them;"
 shall condemned; "they condemned
 already."(john 3.36, 3.18) can conceived, benefit
 faith, "is remission sins" unlesse conceive withall, the
 dammage infidelity, "the retention sins."
 
end (may man aske), apostles, other
 pastors church, time, meet together, agree
 upon doctrine taught, faith manners, no
 man obliged observe decrees? may answered, that
 apostles, elders councell, obliged even their
 entrance it, teach doctrine therein concluded, decreed
 taught, far forth, precedent law, were
 obliged yeeld obedience, contrary; other
 christians obliged observe, taught. though
 might deliberate teach; yet could
 deliberate others do, unless assembly had
 legislative power; none civill soveraigns. for
 though god soveraign world, bound take
 law, whatsoever propounded every man name; any
 thing contrary civill law, god hath expressely commanded us
 obey.
 
seeing acts councell apostles, laws,
 councells; much lesse laws acts doctors,
 councells since, assembled without authority civill
 soveraign. consequently, books new testament, though most
 perfect rules christian doctrine, made laws other
 authority kings, soveraign assemblies.
 
first councell, made scriptures now have, canon, not
 extant: collection first bishop rome s. peter, is
 subject question: though canonicall books bee reckoned
 up; yet words, "sint vobis omnibus clericis & laicis libris
 venerandi, &c." containe distinction clergy, laity, was
 use neer st. peters time. first councell setling the
 canonicall scripture, extant, laodicea, can. 59.
 forbids reading books churches;
 mandate addressed every christian, to
 onely authority read publiquely church;
 is, ecclesiastiques onely.
 



right constituting ecclesiasticall officers time of
 apostles
 
ecclesiastical officers time apostles, were
 magisteriall, ministeriall. magisteriall offices
 preaching gospel kingdom god infidels; of
 administring sacraments, divine service; teaching the
 rules faith manners converted. ministeriall
 office deacons, is, appointed the
 administration secular necessities church, time
 lived upon common stock mony, raised voluntary
 contributions faithfull.
 
amongst officers magisteriall, first, principall the
 apostles; whereof first twelve; chosen
 constituted saviour himselfe; office onely
 preach, teach, baptize, also martyrs, (witnesses of
 saviours resurrection.) testimony, specificall, and
 essentiall mark; whereby apostleship distinguished other
 magistracy ecclesiasticall; necessary apostle, either to
 seen saviour resurrection, conversed with
 before, seen works, arguments divinity,
 whereby might taken sufficient witnesses. therefore at
 election new apostle place judas iscariot, s. peter
 saith (acts 1.21,22.) "of men companyed us, the
 time lord jesus went among us, beginning the
 baptisme john unto day taken us, must
 one ordained witnesse us resurrection:" where, by
 word must, implyed necessary property apostle, have
 companyed first prime apostles time saviour
 manifested flesh.
 



matthias made apostle congregation.
 
first apostle, constituted christ the
 time upon earth, matthias, chosen manner: there
 assembled together jerusalem 120 christians (acts 1.15.)
 appointed two, joseph just, matthias (ver. 23.) caused
 lots drawn; "and (ver. 26.) lot fell matthias was
 numbred apostles." see ordination this
 apostle, act congregation, st. peter, of
 eleven, otherwise members assembly.
 



paul barnabas made apostles church antioch
 
never apostle ordained, paul and
 barnabas, done (as read acts 13.1,2,3.) manner.
 "there church antioch, certaine prophets, and
 teachers; barnabas, simeon called niger, lucius of
 cyrene, manaen; brought herod tetrarch,
 saul. ministred unto lord, fasted, holy ghost
 said, ‘separate mee barnabas, saul worke whereunto have
 called them.’ fasted, prayed, laid hands
 them, sent away."
 
manifest, though called holy ghost,
 calling declared unto them, mission authorized by
 particular church antioch. calling to
 apostleship, apparent that, called (acts
 14.14.) apostles: vertue act church of
 antioch, apostles, s. paul declareth plainly (rom. 1.1.)
 hee useth word, holy ghost used calling:
 stileth himself, "an apostle separated unto gospel god;"
 alluding words holy ghost, "separate barnabas saul,
 &c." seeing work apostle, witnesse of
 resurrection christ, man may aske, s. paul that
 conversed saviour passion, know was
 risen. easily answered, saviour appeared
 way damascus, heaven, ascension; "and
 chose vessell bear name gentiles, kings,
 children israel;" consequently (having seen lord after
 passion) competent witnesse resurrection: for
 barnabas, disciple passion. therefore evident
 paul, barnabas apostles; yet chosen, authorized
 (not first apostles alone, but) church antioch; as
 matthias chosen, authorized church jerusalem.
 



offices church magisteriall
 
bishop, word formed language, greek episcopus,
 signifieth overseer, superintendent businesse, and
 particularly pastor shepherd; thence metaphor taken, not
 amongst jews originally shepherds, also amongst
 heathen, signifie office king, ruler,
 guide people, whether ruled laws, doctrine. so
 apostles first christian bishops, instituted christ
 himselfe: sense apostleship judas called (acts 1.20.)
 bishoprick. afterwards, constituted elders in
 christian churches, charge guide christs flock their
 doctrine, advice; elders also called bishops. timothy was
 elder (which word elder, new testament name office, as
 well age;) yet also bishop. bishops content
 title elders. nay s. john himselfe, apostle beloved of
 lord, beginneth second epistle words, "the elder to
 elect lady." evident, bishop, pastor, elder,
 doctor, say, teacher, many divers names of
 office time apostles. no
 government coercion, doctrine, perswading. the
 kingdome god yet come, new world; could
 authority compell church, till common-wealth
 embraced christian faith; consequently diversity of
 authority, though diversity employments.
 
besides magisteriall employments church, namely apostles,
 bishops, elders, pastors, doctors, whose calling proclaim
 christ jews, infidels, direct, teach that
 beleeved read new testament other. names
 evangelists prophets, signified office, severall
 gifts, severall men profitable church: as
 evangelists, writing life acts saviour; were
 s. matthew s. john apostles, s. marke s. luke disciples, and
 whosoever else wrote subject, (as s. thomas, s. barnabas are
 said done, though church received books
 gone names:) prophets, gift of
 interpreting old testament; sometimes declaring their
 speciall revelations church. neither gifts, the
 gifts languages, gift casting devils, curing
 diseases, thing else make officer church,
 save onely due calling election charge teaching.
 



ordination teachers
 
apostles, matthias, paul, barnabas, made our
 saviour himself, elected church, is, the
 assembly christians; namely, matthias church jerusalem,
 paul, barnabas church antioch; also the
 presbyters, pastors cities, elected churches of
 cities. proof whereof, let us consider, first, s. paul
 proceeded ordination presbyters, cities had
 converted men christian faith, immediately barnabas
 received apostleship. read (acts 14.23.) "they
 ordained elders every church;" first sight may taken for
 argument, chose, gave authority:
 consider originall text, will manifest, they
 authorized, chosen assembly christians each
 city. words are, "cheirotonesantes autoispresbuterous kat
 ekklesian," is, "when ordained elders holding
 hands every congregation." now well enough known, in
 cities, manner choosing magistrates, officers,
 plurality suffrages; (because ordinary way of
 distinguishing affirmative votes negatives, holding
 hands) ordain officer cities, more
 bring people together, elect plurality votes,
 whether plurality elevated hands, plurality of
 voices, plurality balls, beans, small stones, every
 man cast one, vessell marked affirmative, negative;
 divers cities divers customes point. therefore
 assembly elected elders: apostles onely
 presidents assembly call together election, and
 pronounce elected, give benediction, now
 called consecration. cause presidents
 assemblies, (in absence apostles) elders were,
 called proestotes, latin antistities; words signifie
 principall person assembly, whose office number the
 votes, declare thereby chosen; votes were
 equall, decide matter question, adding own; is
 office president councell. (because churches
 presbyters ordained manner,) word is
 constitute, (as titus 1.5.) "ina katasteses kata polin presbuterous,"
 "for cause left thee crete, thou shouldest constitute
 elders every city," understand thing; namely, that
 hee call faithfull together, ordain presbyters by
 plurality suffrages. strange thing, town, where
 men perhaps never seen magistrate otherwise chosen an
 assembly, town becomming christians, much have
 thought way election teachers, guides, that
 say, presbyters, (otherwise called bishops,) of
 plurality suffrages, intimated s. paul (acts 14.23.) word
 cheirotonesantes: ever choosing bishops, (before
 emperors found necessary regulate order keeping
 peace amongst them,) assemblies christians in
 every severall town.
 
also confirmed continuall practise even day,
 election bishops rome. bishop place,
 right choosing another, succession pastorall
 office, city, time went thence, plant the
 another place; much right, appoint his
 successour place, last resided dyed: find
 not, ever bishop rome appointed successor. were
 long time chosen people, may see sedition raised
 election, damascus, ursinicus; ammianus
 marcellinus saith great, juventius praefect, unable to
 keep peace them, forced goe city; that
 hundred men found dead upon occasion the
 church self. though afterwards chosen, first, the
 whole clergy rome, afterwards cardinalls; yet never any
 appointed succession predecessor. therefore they
 pretended right appoint successors, think may reasonably
 conclude, right appoint new power; none could
 take church bestow them, lawfull
 authority, onely teach, command church; none
 doe, civill soveraign.
 



ministers church what
 
word minister originall diakonos signifieth one that
 voluntarily doth businesse another man; differeth a
 servant onely this, servants obliged condition,
 commanded them; whereas ministers obliged onely by
 undertaking, bound therefore have
 undertaken: teach word god, that
 administer secular affairs church, ministers, but
 ministers different persons. pastors church,
 called (acts 6.4.) "the ministers word," ministers christ,
 whose word is: ministery deacon, called (verse
 2. chapter) "serving tables," service done the
 church, congregation: neither one man, whole
 church, ever pastor say, minister; of
 deacon, whether charge undertook serve tables, or
 distribute maintenance christians, lived city
 common stock, upon collections, first times, to
 take care house prayer, revenue, worldly
 businesse church, whole congregation might properly call him
 minister.
 
employment, deacons, serve congregation; though
 upon occasion omitted preach gospel, maintain the
 doctrine christ, every one according gifts, s. steven did;
 preach, baptize, philip did: philip, which
 (act. 8. 5.) preached gospel samaria, (verse 38.) baptized
 eunuch, philip deacon, philip apostle. is
 manifest (verse 1.) philip preached samaria, apostles
 jerusalem, (verse 14.) "when heard samaria had
 received word god, sent peter john them;" imposition of
 whose hands, baptized (verse 15.) received (which before
 baptisme philip received) holy ghost. it
 necessary conferring holy ghost, baptisme
 administred, confirmed minister word, a
 minister church. therefore confirm baptisme those
 philip deacon baptized, apostles sent own
 number jerusalem samaria, peter, john; conferred them
 baptized, graces signs holy
 spirit, time accompany true beleevers; what
 may understood s. marke saith (chap. 16.17.)
 "these signs follow beleeve name; shall cast out
 devills; shall speak new tongues; shall take serpents,
 drink deadly thing, shall hurt them; shall
 lay hands sick, shall recover." doe, that
 philip give; apostles could, (as appears this
 place) effectually every man truly beleeved, by
 minister christ baptized: power either christs
 ministers age conferre, else true
 beleevers, christ hath ministers.
 



chosen what
 
first deacons chosen, apostles, a
 congregation disciples; is, christian men sorts,
 manifest acts 6. read twelve, the
 number disciples multiplyed, called together, having
 told them, fit apostles leave word
 god, serve tables, said unto (verse 3.) "brethren looke you
 among seven men honest report, full holy ghost, of
 wisdome, may appoint businesse." manifest,
 though apostles declared elected; yet congregation
 chose them; also, (verse fift) expressely said, where
 written, "the saying pleased multitude, chose
 seven, &c."
 



ecclesiasticall revenue, law moses
 
old testament, tribe levi onely capable the
 priesthood, inferiour offices church. land
 divided amongst tribes (levi excepted,) the
 subdivision tribe joseph, ephraim manasses, were
 still twelve. tribe levi assigned certain cities for
 habitation, suburbs cattell: their
 portion, tenth fruits land their
 brethren. again, priests maintenance tenth that
 tenth, together part oblations, sacrifices. god had
 said aaron (numb. 18. 20.) "thou shalt inheritance their
 land, neither shalt thou part amongst them, thy part, and
 thine inheritance amongst children israel." god then
 king, constituted tribe levi publique
 ministers, allowed maintenance, publique revenue,
 say, part god reserved himself; were
 tythes, offerings: meant, god saith, i
 thine inheritance. therefore levites might unfitly
 attributed name clergy kleros, signifieth lot, or
 inheritance; heirs kingdome god, than
 other; gods inheritance, maintenance. now seeing
 time god king, moses, aaron, the
 succeeding high priests lieutenants; manifest, the
 right tythes, offerings constituted civill power.
 
rejection god demand king, enjoyed still
 revenue; right thereof derived that, the
 kings never take them: publique revenue at
 disposing publique person; (till the
 captivity) king. again, return captivity,
 paid tythes priest. hitherto therefore
 church livings determined civill soveraign.
 



saviours time, after
 
maintenance saviour, apostles, read onely they
 purse, (which carried judas iscariot;) and, the
 apostles, fisher-men, sometimes use trade; and
 saviour sent twelve apostles preach, forbad them
 "to carry gold, silver, brasse purses, that
 workman worthy hire:" (mat. 10. 9,10.) it
 probable, ordinary maintenance unsuitable their
 employment; employment (ver. 8.) "freely give, because
 freely received;" maintenance free gift of
 beleeved good tyding carryed coming
 messiah saviour. may adde, was
 contributed gratitude, saviour healed of
 diseases; mentioned "certain women (luke 8. 2,3.) had
 healed evill spirits infirmities; mary magdalen, whom
 went seven devills; joanna wife chuza, herods steward; and
 susanna, many others, ministred unto substance.
 
saviours ascension, christians every city lived in
 common, (acts 4. 34.) upon mony made sale their
 lands possessions, laid feet apostles, of
 good will, duty; "whilest land remained (saith s. peter
 ananias acts 5.4.) thine? sold, it
 thy power?" sheweth needed saved land,
 money lying, bound contribute thing at
 all, unlesse pleased. time apostles, also
 time downward, till constantine great, shall
 find, maintenance bishops, pastors christian
 church, nothing voluntary contribution had
 embraced doctrine. yet mention tythes: but
 time constantine, sons, affection of
 christians pastors, ammianus marcellinus saith (describing
 sedition damasus ursinicus bishopricke,) it
 worth contention, bishops times the
 liberality flock, especially matrons, lived splendidly,
 carryed coaches, sumptuous fare apparell.
 
ministers gospel lived benevolence flocks
 may ask, whether pastor bound live upon
 voluntary contribution, upon almes, "for (saith s. paul 1 cor. 9.
 7.) goeth war charges? feedeth flock, eatheth
 milke flock?" again, (1 cor. 9. 13.) "doe ye not
 know minister holy things, live things of
 temple; wait altar, partake altar;"
 say, part offered altar for
 maintenance? concludeth, "even hath lord
 appointed, preach gospel live gospel.
 place may inferred indeed, pastors church
 maintained flocks; pastors to
 determine, either quantity, kind allowance, and
 (as were) carvers. allowance must needs therefore
 determined, either gratitude, liberality every
 particular man flock, whole congregation. the
 whole congregation be, acts no
 laws: therefore maintenance pastors, emperours civill
 soveraigns made laws settle it, nothing benevolence. they
 served altar lived offered. court should
 sue it, tribunalls? arbitrators
 amongst themselves, execute judgments, no
 power arme officers? remaineth therefore, could
 certaine maintenance assigned pastors church, by
 whole congregation; onely, decrees have
 force (not onely canons, also) laws; laws not
 made, emperours, kings, civill soveraignes. right
 tythes moses law, applyed ministers
 gospell; moses high priests civill
 soveraigns people god, whose kingdom amongst jews was
 present; whereas kingdome god christ yet come.
 
hitherto hath shewn pastors church are; are
 points commission (as preach, teach,
 baptize, presidents severall congregations;) is
 ecclesiasticall censure, viz. excommunication, say, those
 places christianity forbidden civill laws, putting
 company excommunicate, where
 christianity civill law commanded, putting the
 excommunicate congregations christians; elected the
 pastors ministers church, (that was, congregation);
 consecrated blessed them, (that pastor); was
 due revenue, (that none possessions,
 labour, voluntary contributions devout and
 gratefull christians). consider now, office persons
 have, civill soveraignes, embraced also christian
 faith.
 



civill soveraign christian hath right appointing
 pastors
 
first, remember, right judging what
 doctrines fit peace, taught subjects, all
 common-wealths inseparably annexed (as hath already proved cha.
 18.) soveraign power civill, whether one man, one
 assembly men. evident meanest capacity, mens
 actions derived opinions good, evill,
 actions redound unto themselves; consequently,
 men possessed opinion, obedience to
 soveraign power, will bee hurtfull them, their
 disobedience, will disobey laws, thereby overthrow the
 common-wealth, introduce confusion, civill war; avoiding
 whereof, civill government ordained. therefore all
 common-wealths heathen, soveraigns name of
 pastors people, subject lawfully
 teach people, permission authority.
 
right heathen kings, bee thought taken by
 conversion faith christ; never ordained, kings
 beleeving him, deposed, is, subjected but
 himself, (which one) deprived power necessary for
 conservation peace amongst subjects, defence
 foraign enemies. therefore christian kings still the
 supreme pastors people, power ordain pastors
 please, teach church, is, teach people committed
 charge.
 
again, let right choosing (as conversion
 kings) church, time apostles
 (as hath shewn already chapter); even also
 right will civill soveraign, christian. is
 christian, allowes teaching; soveraign
 (which much say, church representation,) the
 teachers hee elects, elected church. assembly of
 christians choose pastor christian common-wealth, the
 soveraign electeth him, tis done authority; the
 manner, town choose maior, act him
 hath soveraign power: every act done, act him,
 without whose consent invalid. therefore whatsoever examples
 may drawn history, concerning election pastors, the
 people, clergy, arguments right of
 civill soveraign, elected his
 authority.
 
seeing every christian common-wealth, civill soveraign is
 supreme pastor, whose charge whole flock subjects is
 committed, consequently authority, all
 pastors made, power teach, performe all
 pastorall offices; followeth also, civill
 soveraign, pastors derive right teaching,
 preaching, functions pertaining office; they
 ministers; manner magistrates towns,
 judges courts justice, commanders armies, but
 ministers magistrate whole common-wealth,
 judge causes, commander whole militia, is
 alwayes civill soveraign. reason hereof, they
 teach, learn, subjects.
 let supposed, christian king commit authority of
 ordaining pastors dominions another king, (as divers christian
 kings allow power pope;) doth thereby constitute a
 pastor himself, soveraign pastor people; that
 deprive civill power; depending the
 opinion men duty him, fear of
 punishment another world, depend also skill, loyalty
 doctors, lesse subject, ambition, also
 ignorance, sort men. stranger hath
 authority appoint teachers, given soveraign in
 whose dominions teacheth. christian doctors schoolmasters
 christianity; kings fathers families, may receive
 schoolmasters subjects recommendation stranger,
 command; especially ill teaching shall
 redound great manifest profit recommends them:
 can obliged retain them, longer the
 publique good; care stand long charged withall, as
 retain essentiall right soveraignty.
 



pastorall authority soveraigns jure divino, of
 pastors jure civili
 
man therefore ask pastor, execution office,
 chief priests elders people (mat. 21.23.) asked our
 saviour, "by authority dost thou things, gave thee
 authority:" can make just answer, doth
 authority common-wealth, given king, or
 assembly representeth it. pastors, except supreme, execute
 charges right, authority civill
 soveraign, is, jure civili. king, every soveraign
 executeth office supreme pastor, immediate authority god,
 say, gods right, jure divino. therefore none but
 kings can put titles (a mark submission god onely
 ) dei gratia rex, &c. bishops say beginning their
 mandates, "by favour kings majesty, bishop a
 diocesse;" civill ministers, "in majesties name." in
 saying, divina providentia, dei gratia, though
 disguised, deny received authority civill
 state; sliely slip collar civill subjection,
 contrary unity defence common-wealth.
 



christian kings power execute manner pastoral function
 
every christian soveraign supreme pastor own
 subjects, seemeth hath also authority, preach
 (which perhaps man will deny;) also baptize, administer
 sacrament lords supper; consecrate temples, and
 pastors gods service; men deny; partly use
 it; partly administration sacraments,
 consecration persons, places holy uses, requireth the
 imposition mens hands, like imposition successively
 time apostles ordained like ministery.
 proof therefore christian kings power baptize, to
 consecrate, render reason, use doe it,
 how, without ordinary ceremony imposition hands, are
 made capable it, will.
 
doubt king, case skilfull the
 sciences, might right office, read lectures of
 himself, authorizeth others read the
 universities. neverthelesse, care summe the
 businesse common-wealth taketh whole time, not
 convenient apply person particular. king
 may also please, sit judgment, hear determine manner
 causes, well give others authority doe name; but
 charge lyeth upon command government, constrain
 bee continually helm, commit ministeriall
 offices others him. like manner saviour (who surely
 power baptize) baptized none himselfe, sent apostles and
 disciples baptize. (john 4.2.) also s. paul, necessity of
 preaching divers far distant places, baptized few: amongst all
 corinthians baptized crispus, cajus, stephanus; (1
 cor.1.14,16.) reason was, principall charge to
 preach. (1 cor. 1.17.) whereby manifest, greater charge,
 (such government church,) dispensation the
 lesse. reason therefore christian kings use baptize, is
 evident, same, day baptized by
 bishops, pope fewer.
 
concerning imposition hands, whether needfull, the
 authorizing king baptize, consecrate, may consider thus.
 
imposition hands, ancient publique ceremony amongst the
 jews, designed, made certain, person, other
 thing intended mans prayer, blessing, sacrifice, consecration,
 condemnation, speech. jacob blessing children of
 joseph (gen. 48.14.) "laid right hand ephraim younger, and
 left hand manasseh first born;" wittingly
 (though presented joseph, forced in
 stretch arms acrosse) design intended
 greater blessing. also sacrificing burnt offering,
 aaron commanded (exod. 29.10.) "to lay hands head the
 bullock;" (ver. 15.) "to lay hand head ramme."
 also said again, levit. 1.4. & 8.14. likewise moses he
 ordained joshua captain israelites, is, consecrated
 gods service, (numb. 27.23.) "laid hands upon him, gave
 charge," designing rendring certain, were
 obey war. consecration levites (numb. 8.10.) god
 commanded "the children israel put hands upon the
 levites." condemnation blasphemed lord
 (levit. 24.14.) god commanded "all heard lay their
 hands head, congregation stone him." and
 heard him, lay hands upon him, not
 rather priest, levite, minister justice, that
 none else able design, demonstrate eyes the
 congregation, blasphemed, die? and
 design man, thing, hand eye lesse
 subject mistake, done eare name.
 
much ceremony observed, blessing whole
 congregation once, done laying hands, yet
 "aaron (levit. 9.22.) lift hand towards people he
 blessed them." read also like ceremony consecration of
 temples amongst heathen, priest laid hands on
 post temple, uttering words of
 consecration. naturall design individuall thing, rather
 hand, assure eyes, words inform eare in
 matters gods publique service.
 
ceremony therefore new saviours time. jairus
 (mark 5.23.) whose daughter sick, besought saviour (not heal
 her, but) "to lay hands upon her, shee might bee healed." and
 (matth. 19.13.) "they brought unto little children, hee should
 put hands them, pray."
 
according ancient rite, apostles, presbyters, the
 presbytery self, laid hands ordained pastors, and
 withall prayed might receive holy ghost; that
 once, sometimes oftner, new occasion presented:
 end still same, namely punctuall, religious
 designation person, ordained either pastorall charge
 general, particular mission: (act. 6.6.) "the apostles
 prayed, laid hands" seven deacons; done,
 give holy ghost, (for full holy ghost
 thy chosen, appeareth immediately before, verse 3.) but
 design office. philip deacon converted
 certain persons samaria, peter john went (act. 8.17.)" and
 laid hands them, received holy ghost." not
 apostle, presbyter power: s. paul adviseth
 timothy (1 tim. 5.22.) "lay hands suddenly man;" is, designe
 man rashly office pastor. whole presbytery laid their
 hands timothy, read 1 tim. 4.14. understood,
 appointment presbytery, most
 likely proestos, prolocutor, may st. paul
 himself. 2 epist. tim. ver. 6. saith him, "stirre up
 gift god thee, laying hands:" where
 note way, holy ghost, meant third person
 trinity, gifts necessary pastorall office. read
 also, st. paul imposition hands twice; ananias at
 damascus (acts 9.17,18.) time baptisme; (acts
 13.3.) antioch, first sent preach. use of
 ceremony considered ordination pastors, design
 person gave power. any
 christian, power teaching before; baptizing of
 him, making christian, given new power,
 onely caused preach true doctrine, is, use
 power aright; therefore imposition hands been
 unnecessary; baptisme selfe sufficient. every soveraign,
 christianity, power teaching, ordaining teachers;
 therefore christianity gave new right, directed
 way teaching truth; consequently needed
 imposition hands (besides done baptisme) to
 authorize exercise part pastorall function, as
 namely, baptize, consecrate. old testament, though
 priest right consecrate, time the
 soveraignty high priest; yet the
 soveraignty king: read (1 kings 8.) solomon
 blessed people, consecrated temple, pronounced publique
 prayer, pattern now consecration christian
 churches, chappels: whereby appears, right
 ecclesiasticall government; also exercising ecclesiasticall
 functions.

cardinal bellarmines books summo pontifice considered
 
though said, places book,
 seem cleer enough asserting supreme ecclesiasticall power
 christian soveraigns; yet pope romes challenge that
 power universally, hath maintained chiefly, think strongly
 possible, cardinall bellarmine, controversie summo
 pontifice; thought necessary, briefly can, examine
 grounds, strength discourse.
 



first book
 
five books hath written subject, first containeth
 three questions: one, simply best government, monarchy,
 aristocracy, democracy; concludeth neither, a
 government mixt there: another, best
 government church; concludeth mixt, should
 participate monarchy: third, whether mixt monarchy,
 st. peter place monarch. concerning first conclusion, i
 already sufficiently proved (chapt. 18.) governments which
 men bound obey, simple, absolute. monarchy is
 one man supreme; men kind power in
 state, commission, pleasure; execute
 name: aristocracy, democracy, one supreme
 assembly, power monarchy belongeth monarch,
 mixt, absolute soveraignty. three
 sorts, best, disputed, one them
 already established; present alwaies preferred,
 maintained, accounted best; law of
 nature, divine positive law, doe thing tending the
 subversion thereof. besides, maketh nothing power of
 pastor, (unlesse civill soveraignty,) kind of
 government best; calling govern men by
 commandement, teach them, perswade arguments, and
 leave consider, whether shall embrace, reject the
 doctrine taught. monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, mark out
 unto us three sorts soveraigns, pastors; or, may say,
 three sorts masters families, three sorts schoolmasters for
 children.
 
therefore second conclusion, concerning best form of
 government church, nothing question popes power
 without dominions: common-wealths power (if
 hee all) schoolmaster onely, the
 master family.
 
third conclusion, is, st. peter monarch the
 church, bringeth chiefe argument place s. matth.
 (chap. 16.18, 19.) "thou art peter, upon rock will build my
 church, &c. will give thee keyes heaven; whatsoever thou
 shalt bind earth, shall bound heaven, whatsoever thou shalt
 loose earth, shall loosed heaven." place well considered,
 proveth more, church christ hath foundation one
 onely article; namely, peter name apostles
 professing, gave occasion saviour speak words cited;
 wee may cleerly understand, consider, our
 saviour preached himself, john baptist, apostles,
 nothing article faith, "that christ;" other
 articles requiring faith otherwise, founded that. john
 began first, (mat. 3.2.) preaching this, "the kingdome god at
 hand." saviour (mat. 4.17.) preached same: to
 twelve apostles, gave commission (mat. 10.7.)
 mention preaching article that. was
 fundamentall article, foundation churches faith.
 afterwards apostles returned him, asketh all, (mat.
 16.13) peter onely, "who men said was;" answered, that
 "some said john baptist, elias, others jeremias,
 one prophets:" (ver. 15.) asked again, (not
 peter onely) "whom say yee am?" therefore peter answered (for
 all) "thou art christ, living god;" said is
 foundation faith whole church; saviour
 takes occasion saying, "upon stone will build church;"
 manifest, foundation-stone church, was
 meant fundamentall article churches faith. (will
 object) doth saviour interpose words, "thou art peter"?
 originall text rigidly translated, reason
 easily appeared: therefore consider, the
 apostle simon, surnamed stone, (which signification of
 syriacke word cephas, greek word petrus). saviour
 therefore confession fundamentall article, alluding
 name, said (as english) thus, thou art "stone," and
 upon stone will build church: much say, this
 article, "i christ," foundation faith i
 require bee members church: neither this
 allusion name, unusuall thing common speech: been
 strange, obscure speech, saviour intending build his
 church person st. peter, said, "thou art stone, and
 upon stone will build church," obvious without
 ambiguity said, "i will build church thee; yet there
 still allusion name.
 
following words, "i will give thee keyes heaven, &c."
 saviour gave also rest his
 disciples (matth. 18.18.) "whatsoever yee shall bind earth, shall be
 bound heaven. whatsoever ye shall loose earth, shall loosed
 heaven." howsoever interpreted, doubt but
 power granted belongs supreme pastors; all
 christian civill soveraignes dominions. much, if
 st. peter, saviour converted beleeve
 him, acknowledge kingdome; yet kingdome of
 world, left supreme care converting subjects to
 none him; else hee must deprived soveraignty,
 right teaching inseparably annexed. thus much in
 refutation first book, wherein hee prove st. peter have
 monarch universall church, say, the
 christians world.
 



second book
 
second book hath two conclusions: one, s. peter bishop
 rome, dyed: other, popes rome his
 successors. disputed others. supposing them
 true; yet bishop rome bee understood either the
 monarch church, supreme pastor it; silvester, but
 constantine (who first christian emperour) bishop; and
 constantine, christian emperors right supreme
 bishops roman empire; say roman empire, all
 christendome: christian soveraigns right their
 severall territories, office essentially adhaerent their
 soveraignty. shall serve answer second book.
 



third book
 
third book, handleth question whether pope be
 antichrist. part, see argument proves so, that
 sense scripture useth name: will take argument from
 quality antichrist, contradict authority exerciseth,
 hath heretofore exercised dominions prince, or
 state.
 
evident prophets old testament foretold, the
 jews expected messiah, is, christ, re-establish
 amongst kingdom god, rejected in
 time samuel, required king manner of
 nations. expectation theirs, made obnoxious the
 imposture such, ambition attempt attaining
 kingdome, art deceive people counterfeit
 miracles, hypocriticall life, orations doctrine plausible.
 saviour therefore, apostles forewarned men false
 prophets, false christs. false christs, pretend to
 christ, not, called properly antichrists, such
 sense, happeneth schisme church election
 two popes, one calleth antipapa, false pope.
 therefore antichrist proper signification hath two essentiall
 marks; one, denyeth jesus christ; another he
 professeth himselfe bee christ. first mark set s. john
 1 epist. 4. ch. 3. ver. "every spirit confesseth that
 jesus christ come flesh, god; spirit
 antichrist." mark expressed words saviour,
 (mat. 24.5.) "many shall come name, saying, christ;" and
 again, "if man shall say unto you, loe, christ, is
 christ beleeve not." therefore antichrist must false christ,
 is, one shall pretend christ.
 two marks, "to deny jesus christ," to
 "affirm himselfe christ," followeth, must also be
 "adversary true christ," another usuall signification
 word antichrist. many antichrists, one
 speciall one, antichristos, antichrist, antichrist definitely,
 one certaine person; indefinitely antichrist. now seeing the
 pope rome, neither pretendeth himself, denyeth jesus the
 christ, perceive can called antichrist; word
 meant, one falsely pretendeth lieutenant, vicar
 generall, hee. also mark time this
 speciall antichrist, (mat. 24.15.) abominable destroyer,
 spoken daniel, (dan. 9. 27.) shall stand holy place, and
 tribulation since beginning world, ever
 shall again, insomuch last long, (ver. 22.) "no
 flesh saved; elects sake days shall be
 shortened" (made fewer). tribulation yet come; it
 followed immediately (ver. 29.) darkening sun
 moon, falling stars, concussion heavens, the
 glorious coming saviour, cloudes. therefore the
 antichrist yet come; whereas, many popes come gone.
 true, pope taking upon give laws christian
 kings, nations, usurpeth kingdome world, christ took
 him: doth christ, christ, wherein
 nothing antichrist.
 



fourth book
 
fourth book, prove pope supreme judg all
 questions faith manners, (which much absolute
 monarch christians world,) bringeth three propositions:
 first, judgments infallible: second, can
 make laws, punish observe not: third, that
 saviour conferred jurisdiction ecclesiasticall pope of
 rome.
 



texts infallibility popes judgement points faith
 
infallibility judgments, alledgeth scriptures: and
 first, luke 22.31. "simon, simon, satan hath desired that
 hee may sift wheat; prayed thee, thy faith
 faile not; thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren." this,
 according bellarmines exposition, is, christ gave simon
 peter two priviledges: one, neither faith fail, neither
 he, successors ever define point concerning
 faith, manners erroneously, contrary definition former
 pope: strange, much strained interpretation. he
 attention readeth chapter, shall find place
 whole scripture, maketh popes authority,
 place. priests scribes seeking kill our
 saviour passeover, judas possessed resolution to
 betray him, day killing passeover come, saviour
 celebrated apostles, said, till kingdome
 god come hee doe more; withall told them, one
 betray him: hereupon questioned, it
 be; withall (seeing next passeover master would
 celebrate king) entred contention, who
 greater man. saviour therefore told them, that
 kings nations dominion subjects, are
 called name (in hebrew) signifies bountifull; cannot
 you, must endeavour serve one another; ordain a
 kingdome, father hath ordained mee; kingdome that
 now purchase blood, possesse till second
 coming; yee shall eat drink table, sit thrones,
 judging twelve tribes israel: addressing to
 st. peter, saith, simon, simon, satan seeks suggesting present
 domination, weaken faith future; prayed for
 thee, thy faith shall fail; thou therefore (note this,) being
 converted, understanding kingdome another world, confirm
 faith thy brethren: s. peter answered (as one that
 expected authority world) "lord ready goe
 thee, onely prison, death." whereby manifest,
 s. peter onely jurisdiction given world, a
 charge teach apostles, also none.
 infallibility st. peters sentence definitive matter
 faith, attributed text, than
 peter continue beleef point, namely, that
 christ come again, possesse kingdome day of
 judgement; given text successors; for
 wee see claim world now is.
 
second place matth. 16. "thou art peter, upon this
 rocke will build church, gates hell shall prevail
 it." (as already shewn chapter) is
 proved more, gates hell shall prevail against
 confession peter, gave occasion speech; namely
 this, jesus christ sonne god.
 
third text john 21. ver. 16,17. "feed sheep;" contains
 commission teaching: grant rest the
 apostles contained name sheep; supreme
 power teaching: onely time no
 christian soveraigns already possessed supremacy. have
 already proved, christian soveraignes owne dominions
 supreme pastors, instituted thereto, vertue being
 baptized, though without imposition hands. imposition
 ceremony designing person, needlesse, hee is
 already designed power teaching doctrine will, his
 institution absolute power subjects. proved
 before, soveraigns supreme teachers (in generall) office
 therefore oblige (by baptisme) teach the
 doctrine christ: suffer others teach people,
 doe perill souls; hands
 heads families god will require account the
 instruction children servants. abraham himself,
 hireling, god saith (gen. 18.19) "i know will
 command children, houshold him, keep way
 lord, justice judgement.
 
fourth place exod. 28.30. "thou shalt put the
 breastplate judgment, urim thummin:" hee saith is
 interpreted septuagint, delosin kai aletheian, is, evidence
 truth: thence concludeth, god given evidence, truth,
 (which almost infallibility,) high priest. evidence
 truth selfe given; admonition priest
 endeavour inform cleerly, give judgment uprightly;
 yet given high priest, given civill
 soveraign: next god high priest common-wealth
 israel; argument evidence truth, is, the
 ecclesiasticall supremacy civill soveraigns subjects,
 pretended power pope. texts hee
 bringeth infallibility judgement pope, point of
 faith.
 



texts point manners
 
infallibility judgment concerning manners, hee bringeth
 one text, john 16.13. "when spirit truth is
 come, hee will lead truth" (saith he) truth,
 meant, least, truth necessary salvation. this
 mitigation, attributeth infallibility pope, to
 man professeth christianity, damned: for
 man erre point, wherein erre necessary to
 salvation, impossible saved; onely is
 necessary salvation, without saved impossible. what
 points are, shall declare scripture chapter
 following. place say more, though granted,
 pope possibly teach error all, yet doth this
 entitle jurisdiction dominions another prince,
 unlesse shall also say, man obliged conscience set on
 work upon occasions best workman, even also hath
 formerly promised work another.
 
besides text, argueth reason, thus, pope erre
 necessaries, christ hath sufficiently provided the
 churches salvation; hath commanded follow popes
 directions. reason invalid, unlesse shew when, where
 christ commanded that, took notice pope: nay granting
 whatsoever given s. peter given pope; yet seeing there
 scripture command man obey st. peter, man can
 bee just, obeyeth him, commands contrary of
 lawfull soveraign.
 
lastly, hath declared church, pope
 himselfe, civill soveraign christians the
 world; therefore christians bound acknowledge his
 jurisdiction point manners. civill soveraignty, and
 supreme judicature controversies manners, thing: and
 makers civill laws, onely declarers, also makers
 justice, injustice actions; nothing mens
 manners makes righteous, unrighteous, conformity
 law soveraign. therefore pope challengeth
 supremacy controversies manners, hee teacheth men disobey the
 civill soveraign; erroneous doctrine, contrary the
 many precepts saviour apostles, delivered us the
 scripture.
 
prove pope power make laws, alledgeth many places; as
 first, deut. 17.12. "the man will doe presumptuously, will not
 hearken unto priest, (that standeth minister the
 lord thy god, unto judge,) even man shall die, thou
 shalt put away evill israel." answer whereunto, to
 remember high priest (next immediately god) the
 civill soveraign; judges constituted him. the
 words alledged sound therefore thus. "the man will presume to
 disobey civill soveraign time being, officers
 execution places, man shall die, &c." is
 cleerly civill soveraignty, universall power the
 pope.
 
secondly, alledgeth matth. 16. "whatsoever yee shall bind,
 &c." interpreteth binding attributed (matth.
 23.4.) scribes pharisees, "they bind heavy burthens, and
 grievous born, lay mens shoulders;" meant
 (he sayes) making laws; concludes thence, pope can make
 laws. also maketh onely legislative power civill
 soveraigns: scribes, pharisees sat moses chaire,
 moses next god soveraign people israel: and
 therefore saviour commanded doe say,
 do. is, obey laws, not
 follow example.
 
third place, john 21.16. "feed sheep;" power
 make laws, command teach. making laws belongs lord of
 family; owne discretion chooseth chaplain, also a
 schoolmaster teach children.
 
fourth place john 20.21. him. words are, "as my
 father sent me, send you." saviour sent redeem (by
 death) beleeve; own, apostles
 preaching prepare entrance kingdome; he
 saith, world, hath taught us pray the
 coming hereafter, though hee refused (acts 1.6,7.) tell his
 apostles come; which, comes, twelve
 apostles shall sit twelve thrones (every one perhaps high that
 st. peter) judge twelve tribes israel. seeing god the
 father sent saviour make laws present world, wee may
 conclude text, neither saviour send s. peter to
 make laws here, perswade men expect second comming with
 stedfast faith; mean time, subjects, obey their
 princes; princes, beleeve themselves, their
 best make subjects doe same; office a
 bishop. therefore place maketh strongly joining the
 ecclesiasticall supremacy civill soveraignty, contrary that
 cardinall bellarmine alledgeth for.
 
fift place acts 15.28. "it hath seemed good holy spirit,
 us, lay upon greater burden, necessary
 things, yee abstaine meats offered idols, bloud,
 things strangled, fornication." hee notes the
 word laying burdens legislative power. there,
 reading text, can say, stile apostles may as
 properly used giving counsell, making laws? stile a
 law is, command: but, think good, ordinary stile them,
 give advice; lay burthen give advice, though
 bee conditionall, is, give it, will
 attain ends: burthen, abstaining things
 strangled, bloud; absolute, case will not
 erre. shewn (chap. 25.) law, distinguished from
 counsell, this, reason law, taken designe,
 benefit prescribeth it; reason counsell,
 designe, benefit him, counsell given. but
 here, apostles aime onely benefit converted gentiles,
 namely salvation; benefit; done their
 endeavour, shall reward, whether obeyed, not.
 therefore acts councell, laws, counsells.
 
sixt place rom. 13. "let every soul subject the
 higher powers, power god;" meant, he
 saith onely secular, also ecclesiasticall princes. to
 answer, first, ecclesiasticall princes but
 also civill soveraignes; principalities exceed
 compasse civill soveraignty; without bounds
 though may received doctors, acknowledged for
 princes. apostle meant, subject our
 princes, also pope, taught us doctrine, which
 christ hath told us impossible, namely, "to serve two
 masters." though apostle say another place, "i write these
 things absent, lest present use sharpnesse,
 according power lord hath given me;" not, that
 challenged power either put death, imprison, banish, whip,
 fine them, punishments; onely excommunicate,
 (without civill power) leaving their
 company, doe them, heathen man,
 publican; many occasions might greater pain the
 excommunicant, excommunicate.
 
seventh place 1 cor. 4.21. "shall come unto rod, or
 love, spirit lenity?" again, power
 magistrate punish offenders, meant rod; but
 onely power excommunication, owne nature
 punishment, onely denouncing punishment, christ shall
 inflict, shall possession kingdome, day of
 judgment. also shall bee properly punishment, upon a
 subject hath broken law; revenge, upon enemy, or
 revolter, denyeth right saviour kingdome: and
 therefore proveth legislative power bishop, has
 also civill power.
 
eighth place is, timothy 3.2. "a bishop must husband of
 one wife, vigilant, sober, &c." saith law. thought that
 none make law church, monarch church, st.
 peter. suppose precept made authority st. peter;
 yet see reason call law, rather advice, seeing
 timothy subject, disciple st. paul; flock
 charge timothy, subjects kingdome, his
 scholars schoole christ: precepts giveth
 timothy, laws, also law, "drink longer water,
 use little wine thy healths sake"? also
 precepts good physitians, many laws? the
 imperative manner speaking, absolute subjection person,
 maketh precept laws.
 
like manner, ninth place, 1 tim. 5. 19. "against elder
 receive accusation, two three witnesses," wise
 precept, law.
 
tenth place is, luke 10.16. "he heareth you, heareth mee; and
 despiseth you, despiseth me." doubt, that
 despiseth counsell sent christ, despiseth
 counsell christ himself. now sent by
 christ, ordained pastors lawfull authority? who
 lawfully ordained, ordained soveraign
 pastor? ordained soveraign pastor christian
 common-wealth, ordained authority soveraign
 thereof? place therefore followeth, heareth
 soveraign christian, heareth christ; hee despiseth
 doctrine king christian, authorizeth, despiseth
 doctrine christ (which bellarmine intendeth
 prove, contrary). nothing law. nay
 more, christian king, pastor, teacher subjects, makes
 thereby doctrines laws. oblige men beleeve; though
 civill soveraign may make laws suitable doctrine, which
 may oblige men certain actions, sometimes would
 otherwise do, command; yet when
 commanded, laws; externall actions done in
 obedience them, without inward approbation, actions of
 soveraign, subject, case as
 instrument, without motion owne all; god hath
 commanded obey them.
 
eleventh, every place, apostle counsell, putteth
 word, men use signifie command; calleth the
 following counsell, name obedience. therefore they
 alledged 1 cor. 11.2. "i commend keeping precepts
 delivered you." greek is, "i commend keeping
 things delivered you, delivered them." far from
 signifying laws, thing else, good counsell.
 1 thess. 4.2. "you know commandements gave you:"
 greek word paraggelias edokamen, equivalent paredokamen,
 wee delivered you, place next alledged, which
 prove traditions apostles, than
 counsells; though said 8th verse, "he despiseth them,
 despiseth man, god": saviour came judge,
 is, king world; sacrifice sinners,
 leave doctors church, lead, drive men christ,
 never accepteth forced actions, (which law produceth,)
 inward conversion heart; work laws,
 counsell, doctrine.
 
2 thess. 3.14. "if man obey word this
 epistle, note man, company him, may bee
 ashamed": word obey, inferre, epistle
 law thessalonians. epistles emperours were
 indeed laws. therefore epistle s. paul also law, they
 obey two masters. word obey, greek
 upakouei, signifieth hearkening to, putting practice, onely
 commanded right punish, also that
 delivered way counsell good; therefore st.
 paul bid kill disobeys, beat, imprison, nor
 amerce him, legislators may do; avoid company, that
 may bee ashamed: whereby evident, empire an
 apostle, reputation amongst faithfull, christians
 stood awe of.
 
last place heb. 13.17. "obey leaders, submit
 selves them, watch souls, must
 give account:" also intended obedience, following of
 counsell: reason obedience, drawn the
 will command pastors, benefit, the
 salvation souls watch for, exaltation of
 power, authority. meant here, they
 teach laws, onely pope, every pastor parish
 legislative power. again, bound obey, their
 pastors, power examine commands. shall wee
 say st. john bids us (1 epist. chap. 4. ver. 1.) "not beleeve
 every spirit, try spirits whether god, because
 many false prophets gone world"? therefore
 manifest, wee may dispute doctrine pastors; man
 can dispute law. commands civill soveraigns sides
 granted laws: else can make law besides himselfe, all
 common-wealth, consequently peace, justice must cease; which
 contrary laws, divine humane. nothing therefore can
 drawn these, places scripture, prove the
 decrees pope, also civill soveraignty, be
 laws.
 
question superiority pope bishops last
 point hee prove, this, "that saviour christ committed
 ecclesiasticall jurisdiction immediately none pope." wherein
 handleth question supremacy pope christian
 kings, pope bishops. first, sayes is
 agreed, jurisdiction bishops, least generall
 jure divino, is, right god; alledges s.
 paul, ephes. 4.11. hee sayes, christ ascension
 heaven, "gave gifts men, apostles, prophets, some
 evangelists, pastors, teachers:" thence inferres,
 indeed jurisdiction gods right; will grant
 immediately god, derived pope. if
 man may said jurisdiction jure divino, yet not
 immediately; lawfull jurisdiction, though civill, a
 christian common-wealth, also jure divino? christian
 kings civill power god immediately; magistrates
 exercise severall charges vertue commission;
 wherein doe, lesse jure divino mediato, than
 bishops doe, vertue popes ordination. all
 lawfull power god, immediately supreme governour, and
 mediately authority him: either hee
 must grant every constable state, hold office right
 god; must hold bishop holds so, besides the
 pope himselfe.
 
whole dispute, whether christ left jurisdiction pope
 onely, bishops also, considered places where
 pope civill soveraignty, contention lana caprina:
 none (where soveraigns) jurisdiction
 all. jurisdiction power hearing determining causes
 man man; can belong none, hath power
 prescribe rules right wrong; is, make laws;
 sword justice compell men obey decisions,
 pronounced either himself, judges ordaineth thereunto;
 none can lawfully do, civill soveraign.
 
therefore alledgeth 6 luke, saviour
 called disciples together, chose twelve named
 apostles, proveth elected (all, except matthias, paul
 barnabas,) gave power command preach, not
 judge causes man man: power which
 refused take upon himselfe, saying, "who made judge, a
 divider, amongst you?" another place, "my kingdome this
 world." hee hath power hear, determine causes
 man man, said jurisdiction all. and
 yet hinders not, saviour gave power preach and
 baptize parts world, supposing own
 lawfull soveraign forbidden: soveraigns christ himself,
 apostles sundry places expressely commanded us all
 things obedient.
 
arguments prove, bishops receive their
 jurisdiction pope (seeing pope dominions other
 princes hath jurisdiction himself,) vain. yet they
 prove, contrary, bishops receive jurisdiction they
 civill soveraigns, will omit recitall of
 them.
 
first, numbers 11. moses able alone to
 undergoe whole burthen administring affairs people of
 israel, god commanded choose seventy elders, took part of
 spirit moses, put upon seventy elders: is
 understood, god weakened spirit moses, not
 eased all; authority from
 him; wherein doth truly, ingenuously interpret place. but
 seeing moses entire soveraignty common-wealth the
 jews, manifest, thereby signified, their
 authority civill soveraign: therefore place proveth,
 bishops every christian common-wealth authority from
 civill soveraign; pope territories only, and
 territories state.
 
second argument, nature monarchy; wherein all
 authority one man, others derivation him: the
 government church, says, monarchicall. also makes for
 christian monarchs. really monarchs people;
 is, church (for church thing a
 christian people;) whereas power pope, though hee were
 s. peter, neither monarchy, hath thing archicall, nor
 craticall, onely didacticall; god accepteth forced, but
 willing obedience.
 
third, is, s. peter called s. cyprian,
 head, source, roote, sun, whence authority
 bishops derived. law nature (which better
 principle right wrong, word doctor but
 man) civill soveraign every common-wealth, head, the
 source, root, sun, jurisdiction derived.
 therefore, jurisdiction bishops, derived civill
 soveraign.
 
fourth, taken inequality jurisdictions: for
 god (saith he) given immediately, given aswell
 equality jurisdiction, order: wee see, bishops but
 town, hundred towns, many whole provinces;
 differences determined command god; their
 jurisdiction therefore god, man; one a
 greater, another lesse, pleaseth prince church. which
 argument, proved before, pope universall
 jurisdiction christians, purpose. seeing
 hath proved, notoriously known, large
 jurisdiction pope given it, is,
 emperours rome, (for patriarch constantinople, upon the
 title, namely, bishop capitall city empire,
 seat emperour, claimed equal him,) followeth,
 bishops jurisdiction soveraigns of
 place wherein exercise same: cause they
 authority jure divino; neither hath pope de
 jure divino, except onely hee also civill soveraign.
 
fift argument this, "if bishops jurisdiction
 immediately god, pope take them, can
 doe nothing contrary gods ordination;" consequence good,
 well proved. "but, (saith he) pope can this, done
 it." also granted, doe dominions, the
 dominions prince hath given power; not
 universally, right popedome: power belongeth to
 every christian soveraign, within bounds owne empire, is
 inseparable soveraignty. people israel (by
 commandment god samuel) set king, the
 manner nations, high priest civill government; and
 none make, depose inferiour priest: power
 afterwards king, may proved argument of
 bellarmine; priest (be high priest other) had
 jurisdiction immediately god, king take it
 him; "for nothing contrary gods ordinance: it
 certain, king solomon (1 kings 2.26.) deprived abiathar high
 priest office, placed zadok (verse 35.) room. kings
 therefore may like manner ordaine, deprive bishops, they
 shall thinke fit, well governing subjects.
 
sixth argument this, bishops jurisdiction jure
 divino (that is, immediately god,) maintaine it, should
 bring word god prove it: can bring none. the
 argument good; therefore nothing say it. it
 argument lesse good, prove pope no
 jurisdiction dominion prince.
 
lastly, hee bringeth argument, testimony two popes, innocent,
 leo; doubt hee might alledged, good
 reason, testimonies popes almost since s. peter: for
 considering love power naturally implanted mankind, whosoever
 made pope, tempted uphold opinion.
 neverthelesse, therein doe, innocent, leo did,
 bear witnesse themselves, therefore witness be
 good.
 



popes temporall power
 
fift book hath four conclusions. first is, "that pope
 lord world:" second, "that pope lord
 christian world:" third, "that pope (without owne
 territory) temporall jurisdiction directly:" three
 conclusions easily granted. fourth is, "that pope (in
 dominions princes) supreme temporall power indirectly:"
 denyed; unlesse mean indirectly, gotten by
 indirect means; also granted. understand, that
 saith hath indirectly, means, temporall
 jurisdiction belongeth right, right a
 consequence pastorall authority, exercise,
 unlesse it: therefore pastorall power
 (which calls spirituall) supreme power civill necessarily
 annexed; thereby hee hath right change kingdomes, giving
 one, taking another, shall think it
 conduces salvation souls.
 
come consider arguments hee prove this
 doctrine, will bee amisse lay open consequences it;
 princes, states, civill soveraignty their
 severall common-wealths, may bethink themselves, whether bee
 convenient them, conducing good subjects, of
 give account day judgment, admit the
 same.
 
said, pope hath (in territories states)
 supreme civill power directly; understand, doth
 challenge it, civill soveraigns doe, originall
 submission thereto governed. evident,
 already sufficiently treatise demonstrated, that
 right soveraigns, derived originally consent of
 every one bee governed; whether choose
 him, doe common defence enemy, they
 agree amongst appoint man, assembly men to
 protect them; whether doe it, save lives, submission
 conquering enemy. pope therefore, disclaimeth the
 supreme civill power states directly, denyeth more, but
 right cometh way; ceaseth that,
 claime another way; is, (without consent them
 governed) right given god, (which hee calleth
 indirectly,) assumption papacy. way soever he
 pretend, power same; may (if bee granted his
 right) depose princes states, often salvation
 soules, is, often will; claimeth also sole
 power judge, whether salvation mens souls, not.
 doctrine, onely bellarmine here, many other
 doctors teach sermons books, also some
 councells decreed, popes decreed, popes have
 accordingly, occasion hath served them, put practise. for
 fourth councell lateran held pope innocent third, (in
 third chap. haereticis,) hath canon. "if king the
 popes admonition, doe purge kingdome haeretiques, being
 excommunicate same, make satisfaction within year, his
 subjects absolved obedience." practise hereof hath
 seen divers occasions; deposing chilperique, king
 france; translation roman empire charlemaine; in
 oppression john king england; transferring kingdome
 navarre; late years, league henry third of
 france, many occurrences. think princes that
 consider injust, inconvenient; wish would
 resolve kings, subjects. men serve two masters: they
 therefore ease them, either holding reins government
 wholly hands; wholly delivering the
 hands pope; men willing obedient, may be
 protected obedience. distinction temporall, and
 spirituall power words. power really divided, as
 dangerously purposes, sharing another indirect power, as
 direct one. come now arguments.
 
first this, "the civill power subject spirituall:
 therefore hath supreme power spirituall, hath right to
 command temporall princes, dispose temporalls order to
 spirituall. distinction temporall, spirituall,
 let us consider sense may said intelligibly, the
 temporall, civill power subject spirituall. but
 two ways words can made sense. wee say, one power
 subject another power, meaning either is, hath
 one, subject hath other; one power is
 other, means end. wee understand, that
 one power hath power another power; one power can have
 right command another: subjection, command, right, and
 power accidents, powers, persons: one power may be
 subordinate another, art sadler, art rider.
 granted, civill government ordained means
 bring us spirituall felicity; yet follow, a
 king civill power, pope spirituall, therefore
 king bound obey pope, every sadler bound to
 obey every rider. therefore subordination art, be
 inferred subjection professor; subordination of
 government, inferred subjection governor. when
 therefore saith, civill power subject spirituall, his
 meaning is, civill soveraign, subject spirituall
 soveraign. argument stands thus, "the civil soveraign, is
 subject spirituall; therefore spirituall prince may
 command temporall princes." conclusion same, the
 antecedent proved. prove it, alledgeth
 first, reason, "kings popes, clergy laity make one
 common-wealth; say, one church: bodies the
 members depend one upon another: things spirituall depend not
 things temporall: therefore, temporall depend spirituall. and
 therefore subject them." argumentation two
 grosse errours: one is, christian kings, popes, clergy, all
 christian men, make one common-wealth: evident that
 france one common-wealth, spain another, venice third, &c. and
 consist christians; therefore also severall bodies
 christians; say, severall churches: severall
 soveraigns represent them, whereby capable commanding and
 obeying, suffering, natural man; generall or
 universall church is, till representant; hath on
 earth: had, doubt christendome were
 one common-wealth, whose soveraign representant, in
 things spirituall temporall: pope, make this
 representant, wanteth three things saviour hath given
 him, command, judge, punish, otherwise (by
 excommunication) run will learn him: for
 though pope christs onely vicar, yet exercise his
 government, till saviours second coming: also the
 pope, st. peter himselfe, apostles, be
 judges world.
 
errour first argument is, sayes, the
 members every common-wealth, naturall body, depend one of
 another: true, cohaere together; depend onely the
 soveraign, soul common-wealth; failing, the
 common-wealth dissolved civill war, one man much
 cohaering another, want common dependance known
 soveraign; just members naturall body dissolve earth,
 want soul hold together. therefore nothing in
 similitude, whence inferre dependance laity the
 clergy, temporall officers spirituall; on
 civill soveraign; indeed direct civill commands
 salvation souls; therefore subject god
 himselfe. thus see laboured fallacy first argument,
 deceive men distinguish subordination of
 actions way end; subjection persons one to
 another administration means. every end, means
 determined nature, god himselfe supernaturally: the
 power make men use means, every nation resigned (by the
 law nature, forbiddeth men violate faith given) the
 civill soveraign.
 
second argument this, "every common-wealth, (because is
 supposed perfect sufficient self,) may command any
 common-wealth, subject it, force change the
 administration government, nay depose prince, set another
 room, otherwise defend selfe injuries
 goes doe them: much may spirituall common-wealth
 command temporall one change administration their
 government, may depose princes, institute others, they
 otherwise defend spirituall good."
 
common-wealth, defend selfe injuries, may lawfully
 doe hath said, true; hath already that
 hath gone sufficiently demonstrated. were
 also true, now world spirituall common-wealth,
 distinct civill common-wealth, might prince thereof,
 upon injury done him, upon want caution injury done
 time come, repaire, secure warre; in
 summe, deposing, killing, subduing, act hostility.
 reason, lesse lawfull civill
 soveraign, upon like injuries done, feared, make warre
 upon spirituall soveraign; beleeve cardinall
 bellarmine inferred proposition.
 
spirituall common-wealth none world: the
 thing kingdome christ; himselfe saith, not
 world; shall next world, resurrection, when
 lived justly, beleeved christ, shall
 (though died naturall bodies) rise spirituall bodies; it
 is, saviour shall judge world, conquer adversaries,
 make spirituall common-wealth. mean time, seeing are
 men earth, whose bodies spirituall; can spirituall
 common-wealth amongst men yet flesh; unlesse wee call
 preachers, commission teach, prepare men for
 reception kingdome christ resurrection, a
 common-wealth; proved bee none.
 
third argument this; "it lawfull christians to
 tolerate infidel, haereticall king, case endeavour draw
 haeresie, infidelity. judge whether king draw
 subjects haeresie, not, belongeth pope. therefore hath
 pope right, determine whether prince deposed, not
 deposed."
 
answer, assertions false. christians,
 (or men religion soever,) tolerate king,
 whatsoever law hee maketh, though bee concerning religion, doe
 violate faith, contrary divine law, naturall and
 positive: judge haeresie amongst subjects, but
 civill soveraign; "haeresie nothing else, private
 opinion, obstinately maintained, contrary opinion the
 publique person (that say, representant common-wealth)
 hath commanded bee taught." manifest, an
 opinion publiquely appointed bee taught, haeresie; the
 soveraign princes authorize them, haeretiques. haeretiques are
 none private men, stubbornly defend doctrine, prohibited
 lawful soveraigns.
 
prove christians tolerate infidell, or
 haereticall kings, alledgeth place deut. 17. god
 forbiddeth jews, shall set king themselves, to
 choose stranger; thence inferreth, unlawfull for
 christian, choose king, christian. ’tis true,
 christian, is, hee hath already obliged
 receive saviour shall come, king, shal
 tempt god much choosing king world, one hee
 knoweth will endeavour, terrour, perswasion make him
 violate faith. but, (saith hee) danger, choose one
 christian, king, depose him, hee
 chosen. say, question danger not
 deposing; justice deposing him. choose him, may some
 cases bee unjust; depose him, chosen, case
 just. alwaies violation faith, consequently the
 law nature, eternal law god. doe wee read, that
 doctrine accounted christian time apostles;
 time romane emperours, till popes civill
 soveraignty rome. hath replyed, christians of
 old, deposed nero, diocletian, julian, valens arrian,
 cause onely, wanted temporall forces. perhaps so. but
 saviour, calling for, might twelve legions
 immortall, invulnerable angels assist him, want forces depose
 caesar, least pilate, unjustly, without finding fault him,
 delivered jews bee crucified? apostles wanted
 temporall forces depose nero, therefore necessary in
 epistles new made christians, teach them, (as did)
 obey powers constituted them, (whereof nero time was
 one,) obey them, fear wrath,
 conscience sake? shall say onely obey, also
 teach meant not, want strength? therefore
 want strength, conscience sake, christians to
 tolerate heathen princes, princes (for call one
 whose doctrine publique doctrine, haeretique) authorize
 teaching errour. whereas temporall power the
 pope, alledgeth further, st. paul (1 cor. 6.) appointed judges
 heathen princes times, ordained by
 princes; true. st. paul advise them,
 take brethren compound differences, as
 arbitrators, rather goe law one another the
 heathen judges; wholsome precept, full charity, fit
 bee practised also best christian common-wealths. for
 danger may arise religion, subjects tolerating an
 heathen, erring prince, point, subject no
 competent judge; hee bee, popes temporall subjects may judge
 also popes doctrine. every christian prince, have
 formerly proved, lesse supreme pastor subjects, than
 pope his.
 
fourth argument, taken baptisme kings; wherein, that
 may made christians submit scepters christ; and
 promise keep, defend christian faith. true; for
 christian kings christs subjects: may, all
 that, bee popes fellowes; supreme pastors own
 subjects; pope king, pastor, even rome it
 selfe.
 
fifth argument, drawn words spoken saviour, feed
 sheep; give power necessary pastor; the
 power chase away wolves, haeretiques; power shut
 rammes, mad, push sheep hornes,
 evill (though christian) kings; power give flock
 convenient food: whence hee inferreth, st. peter these
 three powers given christ. answer, last of
 powers, power, rather command teach.
 first, chase away wolves, is, haeretiques, the
 place hee quoteth (matth. 7.15.) "beware false prophets which
 come sheeps clothing, inwardly ravening wolves."
 neither haeretiques false prophets, prophets: nor
 (admitting haeretiques wolves meant,) apostles
 commanded kill them, kings, depose them; to
 beware of, fly, avoid them: st. peter, of
 apostles, multitude jews followed into
 mountain, men part yet converted, hee gave
 counsell, beware false prophets: therefore it
 conferre power chasing away kings, given, onely private
 men; men christians. power
 separating, shutting furious rammes, (by hee meaneth
 christian kings refuse submit roman pastor,)
 saviour refused take upon power world himself,
 advised let corn tares grow together till day of
 judgment: much lesse hee give st. peter, can s. peter give
 popes. st. peter, pastors, bidden esteem
 christians disobey church, is, (that disobey the
 christian soveraigne) heathen men, publicans. seeing men
 challenge pope authority heathen princes, to
 challenge none bee esteemed heathen.
 
power teach onely, hee inferreth also coercive power
 pope, kings. pastor (saith he) must give flock
 convenient food: therefore pope may, compell kings to
 doe duty. followeth, pope, pastor of
 christian men, king kings: christian kings indeed
 either confesse, else take upon the
 supreme pastorall charge, every one dominion.
 
sixth, last argument, examples. answer,
 first, examples prove nothing; secondly, examples he
 alledgeth make much probability right. fact of
 jehoiada, killing athaliah (2 kings 11.) either authority
 king joash, horrible crime high priest, which
 (ever election king saul) mere subject. fact of
 st. ambrose, excommunicating theodosius emperour, (if were
 true hee so,) capitall crime. popes, gregory 1.
 greg. 2. zachary, leo 3. judgments void, given their
 cause; acts done conformably doctrine, are
 greatest crimes (especially zachary) incident to
 humane nature. thus much power ecclesiasticall; wherein had
 briefe, forbearing examine arguments bellarmine,
 his, private man, champion the
 papacy, christian princes, states.
 


chapter xliii. necessary mans reception the
 kingdome heaven.
 



difficulty obeying god man once
 
frequent praetext sedition, civill warre, christian
 common-wealths hath long time proceeded difficulty, yet
 sufficiently resolved, obeying once, god, man, then
 commandements one contrary other. manifest
 enough, man receiveth two contrary commands, knows that
 one gods, obey that, other, though
 command even lawfull soveraign (whether monarch, or
 soveraign assembly,) command father. difficulty
 therefore consisteth this, men commanded the
 name god, know divers cases, whether command god,
 whether commandeth, doe abuse gods name private
 ends own. ware church jews, many false
 prophets, sought reputation people, feigned dreams, and
 visions; times church christ, false
 teachers, seek reputation people, phantasticall and
 false doctrines; reputation (as nature ambition,)
 govern private benefit.
 



none distinguish is, not
 necessary salvation
 
difficulty obeying god, civill soveraign on
 earth, can distinguish necessary, what
 necessary reception kingdome god, no
 moment. command civill soveraign bee such, it
 may obeyed, without forfeiture life eternall; obey it
 unjust; precept apostle takes place; "servants obey
 masters things;" and, "children obey parents all
 things;" precept saviour, "the scribes pharisees sit
 moses chaire, therefore shall say, observe, doe."
 command such, obeyed, without damned
 eternall death, madnesse obey it, counsell
 saviour takes place, (mat. 10. 28.) "fear kill the
 body, kill soule." men therefore avoid,
 punishments world inflicted, for
 disobedience earthly soveraign, shall be
 inflicted world come disobedience god, need be
 taught distinguish well is, necessary to
 eternall salvation.
 



necessary salvation contained faith obedience
 
necessary salvation, contained two vertues, faith
 christ, obedience laws. latter these, were
 perfect, enough us. wee guilty of
 disobedience gods law, onely originally adam, also
 actually transgressions, required hands now,
 onely obedience rest time, also remission of
 sins time past; remission reward faith
 christ. nothing else necessarily required salvation, is
 manifest this, kingdome heaven, shut none but
 sinners; say, disobedient, transgressors the
 law; them, case repent, beleeve articles of
 christian faith, necessary salvation.
 



obedience necessary;
 
obedience required hands god, accepteth our
 actions will deed, serious endeavour obey him;
 called also names signifie endeavour. and
 therefore obedience, sometimes called names charity, and
 love, imply will obey; saviour maketh
 love god, one another, fulfilling whole law: and
 sometimes name righteousnesse; righteousnesse the
 will give every one owne, say, will obey
 laws: sometimes name repentance; repent,
 implyeth turning away sinne, same, return
 will obedience. whosoever therefore unfeignedly desireth
 fulfill commandements god, repenteth truely his
 transgressions, loveth god heart, neighbor
 himself, hath obedience necessary reception the
 kingdome god: god require perfect innocence, there
 flesh saved.
 



laws
 
commandements god hath given us? all
 laws given jews hand moses, the
 commandements god? bee, christians taught obey
 them? not, others so, besides law nature? for
 saviour christ hath given us new laws, counsell observe
 wee subject to; say, laws nature, the
 laws severall soveraigns: make new law jews
 sermon mount, onely expounded laws moses, to
 subject before. laws god therefore none
 laws nature, whereof principall is, should
 violate faith, is, commandement obey civill
 soveraigns, wee constituted us, mutuall pact one with
 another. law god, commandeth obedience law
 civill, commandeth consequence obedience precepts the
 bible, (as proved precedent chapter) onely
 law, civill soveraign hath made so; places but
 counsell; man perill, may without injustice refuse to
 obey.
 



faith christian, person beleeved
 
knowing now obedience necessary salvation, whom
 due; consider next concerning faith, whom, we
 beleeve; articles, points necessarily beleeved
 shall saved. first, person beleeve,
 impossible beleeve person, know he
 saith, necessary one wee heard speak. person
 therefore, abraham, isaac, jacob, moses prophets beleeved,
 god himself, spake unto supernaturally: person,
 apostles disciples conversed christ beleeved, was
 saviour himself. them, neither god father, nor
 saviour ever spake, said, person they
 beleeved, god. beleeved apostles, the
 pastors doctors church, recommended faith the
 history old new testament: faith christians
 ever since saviours time, hath foundation, first, the
 reputation pastors, afterward, authority that
 made old new testament received rule faith;
 none christian soveraignes; therefore the
 supreme pastors, onely persons, christians now hear speak
 god; except god speaketh to, days supernaturally.
 many false prophets "gone world,"
 men examine spirits (as st. john advised us, 1
 epistle, chap. 4. ver.1.) "whether god, not." and
 therefore, seeing examination doctrines belongeth supreme
 pastor, person speciall revelation are
 beleeve, (in every common-wealth) supreme pastor, to
 say, civill soveraigne.
 



causes christian faith
 
causes men beleeve christian doctrine, various; for
 faith gift god; worketh severall man, by
 wayes, seemeth good unto himself. ordinary immediate
 cause beleef, concerning point christian faith, is, that
 wee beleeve bible word god. wee beleeve the
 bible word god, much disputed, questions must
 needs bee, well stated. make question
 be, "why beleeve it," "how wee know it;" beleeving and
 knowing one. thence one side ground knowledge
 upon infallibility church, side, the
 testimony private spirit, neither side concludeth it
 pretends. shall man know infallibility church, but
 knowing first infallibility scripture? shall man
 know private spirit beleef, grounded upon the
 authority, arguments teachers; upon presumption his
 gifts? besides, nothing scripture, can be
 inferred infallibility church; much lesse, particular
 church; least all, infallibility particular man.
 



faith comes hearing
 
manifest, therefore, christian men doe know, onely
 beleeve scripture word god; means of
 making beleeve god pleased afford men ordinarily, is
 according way nature, say, teachers.
 doctrine st. paul concerning christian faith generall,
 (rom. 10.17.) "faith cometh hearing," is, hearing lawfull
 pastors. saith also (ver. 14,15. chapter) "how shall
 beleeve heard? shall hear
 without preacher? shall preach, except sent?"
 whereby evident, ordinary cause beleeving the
 scriptures word god, cause the
 beleeving articles faith, namely, hearing of
 law allowed appointed teach us, our
 parents houses, pastors churches: also
 made manifest experience. cause can bee
 assigned, christian common-wealths men either beleeve, or
 least professe scripture bee word god, other
 common-wealths scarce any; christian common-wealths they
 taught infancy; places taught
 otherwise?
 
teaching cause faith, doe beleeve? is
 certain therefore faith gift god, hee giveth to
 will. neverthelesse, giveth it, he
 giveth means teachers, immediate cause faith is
 hearing. school many taught, profit, others
 profit not, cause learning profit, master;
 yet thence inferred, learning gift god.
 good things proceed god; yet them, say
 inspired; implies gift supernaturall, the
 immediate hand god; pretends to, pretends a
 prophet, subject examination church.
 
whether men know, beleeve, grant scriptures word
 god; places them, without obscurity, i
 shall shew articles faith necessary, onely necessary for
 salvation, men must needs know, beleeve, grant same.
 
onely necessary article christian faith, (unum necessarium)
 onely article faith, scripture maketh simply necessary to
 salvation, this, jesus christ. name christ, is
 understood king, god promised prophets of
 old testament, send world, reign (over jews,
 nations beleeve him) himself
 eternally; give eternall life, lost the
 adam. proved scripture, will further
 shew when, sense articles may bee also called
 necessary.
 



proved scope evangelists
 
proof beleef article, jesus christ, all
 faith required salvation, first argument shall bee the
 scope evangelists; description life of
 saviour, establish one article, jesus christ. the
 summe st. matthews gospell this, jesus stock of
 david; born virgin; marks true christ: that
 magi came worship king jews: herod the
 cause sought kill him: john baptist proclaimed him: that
 preached himselfe, apostles king; that
 taught law, scribe, man authority: he
 cured diseases word onely, many miracles, which
 foretold christ doe: saluted king he
 entered jerusalem: fore-warned beware others
 pretend christ: taken, accused, put
 death, saying, hee king: cause condemnation
 written crosse, jesus nazareth, king jewes.
 tend end this, men beleeve,
 jesus christ. therefore scope st. matthews
 gospel. scope evangelists (as may appear reading
 them) same. therefore scope whole gospell, the
 establishing onely article. st. john expressely makes his
 conclusion, john 20. 31. "these things written, may know
 jesus christ, living god."
 



sermons apostles:
 
second argument taken subject sermons the
 apostles, whilest saviour lived earth, his
 ascension. apostles saviours time sent, luke 9.2. to
 preach kingdome god: neither there, mat. 10.7. giveth he
 commission them, this, "as ye go, preach, saying, the
 kingdome heaven hand;" is, jesus messiah, the
 christ, king come. preaching also his
 ascension same, manifest acts 17.6. "they drew (saith
 st. luke) jason certain brethren unto rulers city,
 crying, turned world upside come hither
 also, jason hath received. contrary decrees
 caesar, saying, another king, one jesus:" of
 2.&3. verses chapter, said, st. paul
 "as manner was, went unto them; three sabbath dayes reasoned
 scriptures; opening alledging, christ must
 needs suffered, risen againe dead, jesus
 (whom preached) christ."
 



easinesse doctrine:
 
third argument is, places scripture, the
 faith required salvation declared easie. inward
 assent mind doctrines concerning christian faith now
 taught, (whereof greatest part disputed,) necessary to
 salvation, nothing world hard, a
 christian. thief upon crosse though repenting, have
 saved saying, "lord remember thou commest thy
 kingdome;" testified beleefe article, but
 this, jesus king. bee said (as mat.
 11. 30.) "christs yoke easy, burthen light:" that
 "little children beleeve him," matth. 18.6. st.
 paul said (1 cor. 1. 21.) "it pleased god foolishnesse of
 preaching, save beleeve:" st. paul have
 saved, much lesse great doctor church
 suddenly, never perhaps thought transsubstantiation, nor
 purgatory, many articles now obtruded.
 



formall cleer texts
 
fourth argument taken places expresse, receive
 controversie interpretation; first, john 5. 39. "search the
 scriptures, yee thinke yee eternall life; are
 testifie mee." saviour speaketh scriptures
 onely old testament; jews time search
 scriptures new testament, written. old
 testament hath nothing christ, markes men might
 know hee came; descend david, born at
 bethlehem, virgin; doe great miracles, like. therefore
 beleeve jesus he, sufficient eternall life: but
 sufficient necessary; consequently article
 required. again, (john 11. 26.) "whosoever liveth beleeveth in
 mee, shall die eternally," therefore beleeve christ, faith
 sufficient eternall life; consequently faith that
 necessary, beleeve jesus, beleeve jesus the
 christ, one, appeareth verses immediately following.
 saviour (verse 26.) said martha, "beleevest thou
 this?" answereth (verse 27.) "yea lord, beleeve thou art the
 christ, god, come world;" therefore
 article alone faith sufficient life eternall; than
 sufficient necessary. thirdly, john 20. 31. "these things are
 written yee might beleeve, jesus christ, of
 god, beleeving yee might life name." there, to
 beleeve jesus christ, faith sufficient obtaining
 life; therefore article necessary. fourthly, 1 john
 4. 2. "every spirit confesseth jesus christ come the
 flesh, god." 1 joh. 5. 1. "whosoever beleeveth jesus is
 christ, born god." verse 5. "who hee overcommeth
 world, beleeveth jesus god?" fiftly,
 act. 8. ver. 36, 37. "see (saith eunuch) water, doth
 hinder baptized? philip said, thou beleevest all
 thy heart thou mayst. hee answered said, beleeve jesus
 christ god." therefore article beleeved, jesus the
 christ, sufficient baptisme, say, reception into
 kingdome god, consequence, onely necessary. generally
 places saviour saith man, "thy faith hath saved
 thee," cause saith it, confession, directly, by
 consequence, implyeth beleef, jesus christ.
 



foundation articles
 
last argument places, article made the
 foundation faith: holdeth foundation shall bee saved.
 places first, mat. 24.23. "if man shall say unto you, loe,
 christ, there, beleeve not, shall arise false
 christs, false prophets, shall shew great signes wonders,
 &c." wee see, article jesus christ, must bee held,
 though hee shall teach contrary doe great miracles. the
 second place gal. 1. 8. "though we, angell heaven preach
 gospell unto you, wee preached unto you, let
 bee accursed." gospell paul, apostles,
 preached, onely article, jesus christ; therefore
 beleef article, reject authority of
 angell heaven; much mortall man, teach the
 contrary. therefore fundamentall article christian faith.
 third place is, 1 joh. 4.1. "beloved, beleeve every spirit. hereby
 yee shall know spirit god; every spirit confesseth that
 jesus christ come flesh, god." evident,
 article, measure, rule, estimate,
 examine articles; therefore onely fundamentall.
 fourth is, matt. 16.18. st. peter professed this
 article, saying saviour, "thou art christ living
 god," saviour answered, "thou art peter, upon rock will
 build church:" whence inferre, article that,
 doctrines church built, their
 foundation. fift (1 cor. 3. ver. 11, 12, &c.) "other foundation can
 man lay, laid, jesus christ. now man
 build upon foundation, gold, silver, pretious stones, wood, hay,
 stubble; every mans work shall made manifest; day shall
 declare it, shall revealed fire, fire shall try
 every mans work, sort is. mans work abide, he
 hath built thereupon, shall receive reward: mans work shall
 bee burnt, shall suffer losse; shall saved, yet so
 fire." words, partly plain easie understand,
 partly allegoricall difficult; plain, may
 inferred, pastors teach foundation, jesus the
 christ, though draw false consequences, (which men are
 sometimes subject to,) may neverthelesse bee saved; much that
 may bee saved, pastors, hearers, beleeve that
 lawfull pastors taught them. therefore beleef of
 article sufficient; consequence article
 faith necessarily required salvation.
 
now part allegoricall, "that fire shall try
 every mans work," "they shall saved, fire,"
 "through fire," (for originall dia puros,) maketh nothing
 conclusion drawn words, that
 plain. neverthelesse, upon place hath an
 argument taken, prove fire purgatory, will also offer
 conjecture concerning meaning triall doctrines,
 saving men fire. apostle seemeth allude to
 words prophet zachary, ch. 13. 8,9. speaking the
 restauration kingdome god, saith thus, "two parts therein
 shall cut off, die, third shall left therein; and
 will bring third part fire, will refine as
 silver refined, will try gold tryed; shall call
 name lord, will hear them." day judgment, is
 day restauration kingdome god; day
 is, st. peter tells us (2 pet. 3. v.7, 10, 12.) shall the
 conflagration world, wherein wicked shall perish; the
 remnant god will save, shall passe fire, unhurt,
 therein (as silver gold refined fire their
 drosse) tryed, refined idolatry, made call upon
 name true god. alluding whereto st. paul saith, the
 day (that is, day judgment, great day saviours comming
 restore kingdome god israel) shall try every mans doctrine,
 judging, gold, silver, pretious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
 built false consequences true foundation,
 shall see doctrines condemned; neverthelesse themselves
 shall saved, passe unhurt universall fire, live
 eternally, call upon name true onely god. which
 sense nothing accordeth rest holy
 scripture, glimpse fire purgatory.
 



sense articles may called necessary
 
man may aske, whether bee necessary salvation,
 beleeve, god omnipotent; creator world; jesus
 christ risen; men else shall rise dead
 last day; beleeve, jesus christ. i
 answer, are; many articles: such, as
 contained one, may deduced it, more, or
 lesse difficulty. see, they
 beleeve jesus god israel, the
 israelites god omnipotent creator things, doe therein
 also beleeve, god omnipotent creator things? how
 can man beleeve, jesus king shall reign eternally,
 unlesse hee beleeve also risen dead? dead man
 exercise office king. summe, holdeth this
 foundation, jesus christ, holdeth expressely hee
 seeth rightly deduced it, implicitely consequent
 thereunto, though skill enough discern consequence.
 therefore holdeth still good, beleef one article
 sufficient faith obtaine remission sinnes penitent, and
 consequently bring kingdome heaven.
 



faith, obedience necessary salvation
 
now shewn, obedience required salvation,
 consisteth will obey law god, say, in
 repentance; faith required same, comprehended in
 beleef article, jesus christ; will alledge
 places gospell, prove, necessary to
 salvation contained joined together. men whom
 st. peter preached day pentecost, next ascension
 saviour, asked him, rest apostles, saying, (act.
 2.37.) "men brethren shall doe?" st. peter answered
 (in next verse) "repent, baptized every one you, the
 remission sins, ye shall receive gift holy ghost."
 therefore repentance, baptisme, is, beleeving jesus the
 christ, necessary salvation. again, saviour being
 asked certain ruler, (luke 18.18.) "what shall doe inherit
 eternall life?" answered (verse 20) "thou knowest commandements,
 doe commit adultery, doe kill, doe steal, doe bear false
 witnesse, honor thy father, thy mother;" said had
 observed, saviour added, "sell thou hast, give poor,
 come follow me:" much say, relye that
 king: therefore fulfill law, beleeve jesus
 king, required bring man eternall life.
 thirdly, st. paul saith (rom. 1.17.) "the just shall live faith;" not
 every one, just; therefore faith justice (that is, will
 just, repentance) necessary life eternall.
 (mark 1.15.) saviour preached, saying, "the time fulfilled,
 kingdom god hand, repent beleeve evangile,"
 is, good news christ come. therefore repent,
 beleeve jesus christ, required to
 salvation.
 



contributes thereunto
 
seeing necessary faith, obedience (implyed the
 word repentance) concurre salvation; question
 two justified, impertinently disputed.
 neverthelesse, will impertinent, make manifest what
 manner contributes thereunto; sense said,
 justified one, other. first,
 righteousnesse understood justice works themselves,
 man can saved; none hath not
 transgressed law god. therefore wee said be
 justified works, understood will, god doth
 alwaies accept work selfe, well good, evill men.
 sense onely is, man called just, unjust; and
 justice justifies him, is, gives title, gods
 acceptation, just; renders capable living faith,
 not. justice justifies sense,
 justifie, denominate man just; not
 signification discharging law; whereby punishment of
 sins unjust.
 
man also said justified, plea, though in
 selfe unsufficient, accepted; plead will, our
 endeavour fulfill law, repent us failings, god
 accepteth performance selfe: god accepteth not
 will deed, onely faithfull; therefore faith
 makes good plea; sense is, faith onely
 justifies: faith obedience necessary salvation;
 yet severall senses said justifie.
 



obedience god civill soveraign inconsistent
 
whether christian, thus shewn necessary salvation; it
 hard reconcile obedience civill soveraign; is
 either christian, infidel. bee christian, alloweth the
 beleefe article, jesus christ; the
 articles contained in, evident consequence deduced from
 it: faith necessary salvation. a
 soveraign, requireth obedience owne, is, the
 civill laws; also contained laws nature, that
 is, laws god: besides laws nature, laws of
 church, part civill law, (for church that
 can make laws common-wealth,) bee laws divine.
 whosoever therefore obeyeth christian soveraign, thereby
 hindred, neither beleeving, obeying god. suppose that
 christian king foundation, jesus christ, draw
 false consequences, say, make superstructions of
 hay, stubble, command teaching same; yet seeing st.
 paul says, shal saved; much shall saved, teacheth
 command; much yet, teaches not, onely
 beleeves lawfull teacher. case subject forbidden by
 civill soveraign professe opinions, upon
 grounds can disobey? christian kings may erre deducing a
 consequence, shall judge? shall private man judge, the
 question obedience? shall man judg is
 appointed thereto church, is, civill soveraign that
 representeth it? pope, apostle judge, may erre
 deducing consequence? one two, st. peter, st.
 paul erre superstructure, st. paul withstood st. peter his
 face? can therefore contradiction laws god,
 laws christian common-wealth.
 



infidel
 
civill soveraign infidel, every one own
 subjects resisteth him, sinneth laws god (for such
 laws nature,) rejecteth counsell apostles,
 admonisheth christians obey princes, children
 servants obey parents, masters, things. for
 faith, internall, invisible; licence that
 naaman had, need put danger it. they
 do, expect reward heaven, complain of
 lawfull soveraign; much lesse make warre upon him. that
 glad just occasion martyrdome, faith be
 professeth, pretends onely, set colour upon own
 contumacy. infidel king unreasonable, knowing has
 subject, waiteth second comming christ, the
 present world shall burnt, intendeth obey (which is
 intent beleeving jesus christ,) mean time
 thinketh bound obey laws infidel king, (which
 christians obliged conscience doe,) put death, to
 persecute subject?
 
thus much shall suffice, concerning kingdome god, policy
 ecclesiasticall. wherein pretend advance position of
 own, onely shew consequences seem me
 deducible principles christian politiques, (which the
 holy scriptures,) confirmation power civill soveraigns, and
 duty subjects. allegation scripture, have
 endeavoured avoid texts obscure, controverted
 interpretation; alledge none, sense plain,
 agreeable harmony scope whole bible; was
 written re-establishment kingdome god christ. for
 bare words, scope writer giveth the
 true light, writing bee interpreted; that
 insist upon single texts, without considering main designe, can
 derive thing cleerly; rather casting atomes of
 scripture, dust mens eyes, make every thing obscure than
 is; ordinary artifice seek truth, their
 advantage.
 



part iv.
 kingdome darknesse
 



chapter xliv. spirituall darknesse misinterpretation of
 scripture
 



kingdome darknesse what
 
besides soveraign powers, divine, humane, have
 hitherto discoursed, mention scripture another power,
 namely, (eph. 6. 12.), "the rulers darknesse this
 world," (mat. 12. 26.), "the kingdome satan," and, (mat. 9. 34.), "the
 principality beelzebub daemons," say, phantasmes
 appear air: cause satan also called (eph. 2.
 2.) "the prince power air;" (because ruleth the
 darknesse world) (joh. 16. 11.) "the prince world;" and
 consequence hereunto, dominion, opposition
 faithfull (who children light) called the
 children darknesse. seeing beelzebub prince phantasmes,
 inhabitants dominion air darknesse, children of
 darknesse, daemons, phantasmes, spirits illusion,
 signifie allegorically thing. considered, kingdome
 darknesse, set forth these, places the
 scripture, nothing else "confederacy deceivers, to
 obtain dominion men present world, endeavour dark, and
 erroneous doctrines, extinguish light, nature,
 gospell; dis-prepare kingdome god
 come."
 



church yet fully freed darknesse
 
men utterly deprived nativity, light
 bodily eye, idea all, light; man
 conceives imagination greater light, hath some
 time, perceived outward senses: also the
 light gospel, light understanding, man
 can conceive greater degree it, hath
 already attained unto. hence comes passe, men
 means acknowledge owne darknesse, onely by
 reasoning un-forseen mischances, befall their
 ways; darkest part kingdome satan, is
 without church god; say, amongst beleeve not
 jesus christ. say, therefore church enjoyeth
 (as land goshen) light, performance of
 work enjoined us god, necessary. whence comes it, in
 christendome been, almost time apostles,
 justling one another places, forraign,
 civill war? stumbling every little asperity own
 fortune, every little eminence men? such
 diversity ways running mark, felicity, not
 night amongst us, least mist? wee therefore yet dark.
 



four causes spirituall darknesse
 
enemy night naturall ignorance, sown
 tares spirituall errors; that, first, abusing, and
 putting light scriptures: erre, knowing the
 scriptures. secondly, introducing daemonology heathen
 poets, say, fabulous doctrine concerning daemons, which
 idols, phantasms braine, without reall nature of
 own, distinct humane fancy; dead mens ghosts, and
 fairies, matter old wives tales. thirdly, mixing with
 scripture divers reliques religion, much vain and
 erroneous philosophy greeks, especially aristotle. fourthly,
 mingling these, false, uncertain traditions, and
 fained, uncertain history. come erre, "giving heed
 seducing spirits," daemonology "as speak lies in
 hypocrisie," (or originall, 1 tim. 4.1,2. "of that
 play part lyars") "with seared conscience," is, contrary
 knowledge. concerning first these, the
 seducing men abuse scripture, intend speak briefly this
 chapter.
 



errors misinterpreting scriptures, concerning kingdome
 god
 
greatest, main abuse scripture, almost the
 rest either consequent, subservient, wresting it, to
 prove kingdome god, mentioned often scripture, is
 present church, multitude christian men now living, that
 dead, rise last day: whereas kingdome of
 god first instituted ministery moses, jews onely;
 therefore called peculiar people; ceased afterward, in
 election saul, refused governed god more,
 demanded king manner nations; god himself
 consented unto, large proved before, 35.
 chapter. time, kingdome god the
 world, pact, otherwise, ever was, is, shall be
 king, men, creatures, governing according his
 will, infinite power. neverthelesse, promised prophets
 restore government again, time hath in
 secret counsell appointed shall bee fully come, they
 shall turn unto repentance, amendment life; not
 onely so, invited also gentiles come in, enjoy the
 happinesse reign, conditions conversion and
 repentance; hee promised also send world, to
 expiate sins death, prepare his
 doctrine, receive second coming: second coming not
 yet being, kingdome god yet come, wee now
 kings pact, civill soveraigns; saving onely,
 christian men already kingdome grace, much as
 already promise received comming againe.
 



kingdome god present church
 
consequent errour, present church christs kingdome,
 one man, assembly, whose mouth saviour
 (now heaven) speaketh, giveth law, representeth person
 christians, divers men, divers assemblies doe same
 divers parts christendome. power regal christ, being
 challenged, universally pope, particular common-wealths
 assemblies pastors place, (when scripture gives it
 none civill soveraigns,) comes passionately disputed,
 putteth light nature, causeth great a
 darknesse mens understanding, see whom
 engaged obedience.
 



pope vicar generall
 
consequent claim pope vicar generall christ the
 present church, (supposed kingdom his, are
 addressed gospel,) doctrine, necessary a
 christian king, receive crown bishop; from
 ceremony, derives clause dei gratia title;
 onely made king favour god, is
 crowned authority gods universall viceregent earth; and
 every bishop whosoever soveraign, taketh consecration
 oath absolute obedience pope, consequent same, is
 doctrine fourth councell lateran, held pope innocent
 third, (chap. 3. haereticis.) "that king popes
 admonition, doe purge kingdome haeresies, being
 excommunicate same, doe give satisfaction within year,
 subjects absolved bond obedience." where, by
 haeresies understood opinions church rome hath
 forbidden maintained. means, often is
 repugnancy politicall designes pope, other
 christian princes, often, ariseth mist
 amongst subjects, know stranger thrusteth
 throne lawfull prince, they
 placed there; darknesse mind, made to
 fight one another, without discerning enemies their
 friends, conduct another mans ambition.
 



pastors clergy
 
opinion, present church kingdome god,
 proceeds pastours, deacons, ministers the
 church, take name clergy, giving other
 christians name laity, is, simply people. clergy
 signifies those, whose maintenance revenue, god having
 reserved himselfe reigne israelites, assigned
 tribe levi (who publique ministers, no
 portion land set live on, brethren) their
 inheritance. pope therefore, (pretending present church be,
 realme israel, kingdome god) challenging himselfe
 subordinate ministers, like revenue, inheritance of
 god, name clergy sutable claime. thence is,
 tithes, tributes paid levites, gods right,
 amongst israelites, long time demanded, taken of
 christians, ecclesiastiques, jure divino, is, gods right. by
 meanes, people every obliged double tribute;
 one state, another clergy; whereof, clergy,
 tenth revenue, double king of
 athens (and esteemed tyrant) exacted subjects defraying
 publique charges: demanded twentieth part;
 yet abundantly maintained therewith commonwealth. the
 kingdome jewes, sacerdotall reigne god, tithes
 offerings whole publique revenue.
 
mistaking present church kingdom god,
 came distinction betweene civill canon laws: the
 civil law acts soveraigns dominions, and
 canon law acts pope dominions. which
 canons, though canons, is, rules propounded, but
 voluntarily received christian princes, till translation of
 empire charlemain; yet afterwards, power pope
 encreased, became rules commanded, emperours (to
 avoyd greater mischiefes, people blinded might led into)
 forced let passe laws.
 
hence is, dominions, popes ecclesiasticall
 power entirely received, jewes, turkes, gentiles, the
 roman church tolerated religion, farre forth, the
 exercise profession thereof offend civill
 power: whereas christian, though stranger, roman
 religion, capitall; pope pretendeth christians
 subjects. otherwise much law of
 nations, persecute christian stranger, professing religion
 owne country, infidell; rather more, much they
 christ, him.
 
is, every christian state certaine
 men, exempt, ecclesiasticall liberty, tributes, and
 tribunals civil state; secular clergy,
 besides monks friars, many places, bear great a
 proportion common people, need were, might raised
 alone, army, sufficient warre church militant
 imploy in, owne, princes.
 



error mistaking consecration conjuration
 
second generall abuse scripture, turning consecration
 conjuration, enchantment. consecrate, scripture, to
 offer, give, dedicate, pious decent language gesture, a
 man, thing god, separating common use;
 say, sanctifie, make gods, used by
 those, god hath appointed publike ministers, (as have
 already proved large 35. chapter;) thereby change, not
 thing consecrated, onely use it, profane
 common, holy, peculiar gods service. such
 words, nature qualitie thing selfe, pretended be
 changed, consecration, either extraordinary worke of
 god, vaine impious conjuration. seeing (for frequency
 pretending change nature consecrations,) cannot
 esteemed work extraordinary, conjuration or
 incantation, whereby men beleeve alteration of
 nature not, contrary testimony mans sight, all
 rest senses. example, priest, stead of
 consecrating bread wine gods peculiar service sacrament of
 lords supper, (which separation common use,
 signifie, is, put men mind redemption, the
 passion christ, whose body broken, blood shed upon crosse
 transgressions,) pretends, saying words our
 saviour, "this body," "this blood," nature bread
 there, body; notwithstanding appeared not
 sight, sense receiver, thing appeareth
 consecration. egyptian conjurers, said
 turned rods serpents, water bloud, are
 thought deluded senses spectators false shew
 things, yet esteemed enchanters: wee thought
 them, appeared rods nothing like serpent, and
 water enchanted, nothing like bloud, like thing else but
 water, faced king, serpents
 looked like rods, bloud seemed water? that
 enchantment, lying. yet daily act of
 priest, doe same, turning holy words the
 manner charme, produceth nothing now sense; they
 face us down, hath turned bread man; nay more, into
 god; require men worship it, saviour himself
 present god man, thereby commit grosse idolatry. if
 bee enough excuse idolatry, say bread, but
 god; excuse serve egyptians, case they
 faces say, leeks, onyons worshipped, were
 leeks, onyons, divinity species, or
 likenesse. words, "this body," aequivalent these,
 "this signifies, represents body;" ordinary figure of
 speech: take literally, abuse; though taken, can
 extend further, bread christ his
 hands consecrated. hee never said, bread soever,
 priest whatsoever, say, "this body," or, "this is
 christs body," presently transubstantiated. did
 church rome ever establish transubstantiation, till time
 innocent third; 500. years agoe, the
 power popes highest, darknesse time grown
 great, men discerned bread given eat,
 especially stamped figure christ upon the
 crosse, men beleeve transubstantiated, not
 onely body christ, also wood crosse, and
 eat together sacrament.
 



incantation ceremonies baptisme
 
like incantation, stead consecration, used also the
 sacrament baptisme: abuse gods name severall
 person, whole trinity, sign crosse each
 name, maketh charm: first, make holy water, the
 priest saith, "i conjure thee, thou creature water, name of
 god father almighty, name jesus christ onely son
 lord, vertue holy ghost, thou become conjured
 water, drive away powers enemy, eradicate, and
 supplant enemy, &c." benediction salt
 mingled it; "that thou become conjured salt, all
 phantasmes, knavery devills fraud may fly depart the
 place wherein thou art sprinkled; every unclean spirit bee conjured
 shall come judge quicke dead." in
 benediction oyle. "that power enemy, the
 host devill, assaults phantasmes satan, may be
 driven away creature oyle." infant be
 baptized, subject many charms; first, church dore the
 priest blows thrice childs face, sayes, "goe him
 unclean spirit, give place holy ghost comforter." as
 children, till blown priest daemoniaques: again,
 entrance church, saith before, "i conjure
 thee, &c. goe out, depart servant god:" again
 exorcisme repeated baptized. these,
 incantations, consecrations, administration the
 sacraments baptisme, lords supper; wherein every thing that
 serveth holy men (except unhallowed spittle priest)
 hath set form exorcisme.
 



marriage, visitation sick, consecration places
 
rites, marriage, extreme unction, of
 visitation sick, consecrating churches, church-yards, and
 like, exempt charms; much use of
 enchanted oyle, water, abuse crosse, holy
 word david, "asperges domine hyssopo," things efficacy to
 drive away phantasmes, imaginery spirits.
 



errors mistaking eternall life, everlasting death
 
another generall error, misinterpretation words
 eternall life, everlasting death, second death. though we
 read plainly holy scripture, god created adam estate of
 living ever, conditionall, say, disobeyed
 commandement; essentiall humane nature, but
 consequent vertue tree life; whereof hee liberty
 eat, long hee sinned; hee thrust of
 paradise sinned, lest hee eate thereof, live for
 ever; christs passion discharge beleeve
 him; consequence, restitution eternall life, the
 faithfull, onely: yet doctrine now, hath a
 long time far otherwise; namely, every man hath eternity life by
 nature, much soul immortall: flaming sword
 entrance paradise, though hinder man coming the
 tree life, hinders immortality god took from
 sin; makes need sacrificing christ, for
 recovering same; consequently, onely faithfull
 righteous, also wicked, heathen, shall enjoy
 eternall life, without death all; much lesse second, and
 everlasting death. salve this, said, second, and
 everlasting death, meant second, everlasting life, in
 torments; figure never used, case.
 
doctrine founded onely obscurer places of
 new testament; neverthelesse, whole scope scripture
 considered, cleer enough different sense, unnecessary to
 christian faith. supposing man dies, remaineth
 nothing carkasse; god raised inanimated dust
 clay living creature word, easily raise dead
 carkasse life again, continue alive ever, make him
 die again, another word? soule scripture, signifieth alwaies,
 either life, living creature; body soule jointly,
 body alive. fift day creation, god said, let water
 produce reptile animae viventis, creeping thing hath a
 living soule; english translate it, "that hath life:" again,
 god created whales, "& omnem animam viventem;" english is,
 "every living creature:" likewise man, god made dust
 earth, breathed face breath life, "& factus est
 homo animam viventem," is, "and man made living creature;"
 noah came arke, god saith, hee will smite
 "omnem animam viventem," "every living creature;" deut.
 12.23. "eate bloud, bloud soule;" is
 "the life." places, soule meant substance
 incorporeall, existence separated body, might as
 well inferred living creature, man. that
 souls faithfull, nature, gods
 speciall grace, remaine bodies, resurrection to
 eternity, already think sufficiently proved the
 scriptures, 38. chapter. places new testament,
 said man shall cast body soul hell
 fire, body life; say, shall be
 cast alive perpetuall fire gehenna.
 



doctrine purgatory, exorcismes, invocation saints
 
window is, gives entrance dark doctrine, first, of
 eternall torments; afterwards purgatory, consequently the
 walking abroad, especially places consecrated, solitary, dark, of
 ghosts men deceased; thereby pretences exorcisme
 conjuration phantasmes; also invocation men dead; to
 doctrine indulgences; say, exemption time,
 ever, fire purgatory, wherein incorporeall
 substances pretended burning cleansed, made fit
 heaven. men generally possessed time our
 saviour, contagion daemonology greeks, opinion,
 souls men substances distinct bodies, and
 therefore body dead, soule every man, whether
 godly, wicked, must subsist somewhere vertue nature,
 without acknowledging therein supernaturall gift gods; the
 doctors church doubted long time, place, which
 abide in, till re-united bodies in
 resurrection; supposing while, lay altars: but
 afterward church rome found profitable, build them
 place purgatory; churches later age,
 demolished.
 



texts alledged doctrines aforementioned answered
 before
 
let us now consider, texts scripture seem confirm these
 three generall errors, touched. cardinall
 bellarmine hath alledged, present kingdome god administred by
 pope, (than none make better show proof,)
 already answered them; made evident, kingdome
 god, instituted moses, ended election saul: which
 time priest authority never deposed king. which
 high priest athaliah, done right, in
 right young king joash son: solomon right
 deposed high priest abiathar, set another place. the
 difficult place answer, can brought,
 prove kingdome god christ already world, is
 alledged, bellarmine, church rome; but
 beza; will begin resurrection christ.
 whether hee intend thereby, entitle presbytery supreme
 power ecclesiasticall common-wealth geneva, (and consequently
 every presbytery every common-wealth,) princes,
 civill soveraignes, doe know. presbytery hath
 challenged power excommunicate owne kings, bee the
 supreme moderators religion, places form
 church government, lesse pope challengeth universally.
 



answer text beza infereth
 
kingdome christ began resurrection words are
 (marke 9.1.) "verily, say unto you, that
 stand here, shall tast death, till seene the
 kingdome god come power." words, taken grammatically,
 make certaine, either men stood christ at
 time, yet alive; else, kingdome god must now
 present world. another place difficult:
 apostles saviours resurrection, immediately
 ascension, asked saviour, saying, (acts.1.6.) "wilt thou
 time restore kingdome israel," answered them,
 "it know times seasons, father
 hath put power; ye shall receive power comming of
 holy ghost upon you, yee shall (martyrs) witnesses in
 jerusalem, & judaea, samaria, unto uttermost part
 earth:" much say, kingdome yet come,
 shall foreknow shall come, shall come theefe
 night; will send holy ghost, shall
 power beare witnesse world (by preaching) of
 resurrection, workes done, doctrine have
 taught, may beleeve me, expect eternall life, my
 comming againe: agree comming christs kingdome
 resurrection? st. paul saies (1 thessal. 1.9, 10.)
 "that turned idols, serve living true god, and
 waite sonne heaven:" waite sonne from
 heaven, wait comming king power; were
 necessary, kingdome beene present. againe, the
 kingdome god began (as beza place (mark 9.1.) it)
 resurrection; reason christians ever since the
 resurrection say prayers, "let thy kingdome come"? it
 therefore manifest, words st. mark be
 interpreted. stand (saith saviour)
 shall tast death till seen kingdome god
 come power. kingdome come resurrection
 christ, said, "some them" rather all? all
 lived till christ risen.
 



explication place mark 9.1
 
require exact interpretation text, let them
 interpret first like words saviour st. peter concerning
 st. john, (chap. 21.22.) "if will tarry till come, is
 thee?" upon grounded report hee dye:
 neverthelesse truth report neither confirmed, well
 grounded; refuted, ill grounded words; left a
 saying understood. difficulty also place st.
 marke. lawfull conjecture meaning, that
 immediately followes, here, st. luke, same
 againe repeated, unprobable, say relation
 transfiguration, described verses immediately
 following; said, "after six dayes jesus taketh with
 peter, james, john (not all, disciples)
 leadeth high mountaine apart themselves, and
 transfigured them. rayment became shining, exceeding
 white snow; fuller earth can white them. there
 appeared unto elias moses, talking jesus,
 &c." saw christ glory majestie, come;
 insomuch "they sore afraid." thus promise saviour
 accomplished way vision: vision, may probably
 bee inferred st. luke, reciteth story (ch. 9. ve.
 28.) saith, peter him, heavy with
 sleep; certainly matth. 17.9. (where again
 related;) saviour charged them, saying, "tell man vision
 untill man risen dead." howsoever be, yet
 can thence taken argument, prove kingdome
 god taketh beginning till day judgement.
 



abuse texts defence power pope
 
texts, prove popes power civill
 soveraignes (besides bellarmine;) two swords that
 christ apostles amongst them, spirituall the
 temporall sword, say st. peter given christ: and,
 two luminaries, greater signifies pope, the
 lesser king; one might well inferre first verse the
 bible, heaven meant pope, earth king: which
 arguing scripture, wanton insulting princes, that
 came fashion time popes growne secure their
 greatnesse, contemne christian kings; treading the
 necks emperours, mocke them, scripture, words
 91. psalm, "thou shalt tread upon lion adder, the
 young lion dragon thou shalt trample thy feet."
 



manner consecrations scripture, without exorcisms
 
rites consecration, though depend part
 upon discretion judgement governors church,
 upon scriptures; yet governors obliged such
 direction, nature action selfe requireth; the
 ceremonies, words, gestures, decent, significant, at
 least conformable action. moses consecrated tabernacle,
 altar, vessels belonging (exod. 40.) anointed
 oyle god commanded bee made that
 purpose; holy; nothing exorcised, drive away
 phantasmes. moses (the civill soveraigne israel) he
 consecrated aaron (the high priest,) sons, wash with
 water, (not exorcised water,) put garments upon them, anointed
 oyle; sanctified, minister unto lord
 priests office; simple decent cleansing, and
 adorning them, hee presented god, servants.
 king solomon, (the civill soveraigne israel) consecrated the
 temple hee built, (2 kings 8.) stood congregation
 israel; blessed them, gave thanks god, putting
 heart father, build it; giving himselfe
 grace accomplish same; prayed unto him, first,
 accept house, though sutable infinite
 greatnesse; hear prayers servants pray
 therein, (if absent) towards it; lastly, offered a
 sacrifice peace-offering, house dedicated. no
 procession; king stood still first place; exorcised water;
 asperges me, impertinent application words spoken upon
 another occasion; decent, rationall speech, in
 making god present new built house, conformable
 occasion. read st. john exorcise water
 jordan; philip water river wherein baptized the
 eunuch; pastor time apostles, take his
 spittle, put nose person baptized, say,
 "in odorem suavitatis," is, "for sweet savour unto lord;"
 wherein neither ceremony spittle, uncleannesse; the
 application scripture levity, can authority of
 man justified.
 



immortality mans soule, proved scripture nature,
 grace
 
prove soule separated body liveth eternally, not
 onely soules elect, especiall grace, restauration of
 eternall life adam lost sinne, saviour restored
 sacrifice himself, faithfull, also soules
 reprobates, property naturally consequent essence of
 mankind, without grace god, universally given
 mankind; divers places, first sight seem
 sufficiently serve turn: such, compare with
 (chapter 38.) alledged 14 job,
 seem mee much subject divers interpretation, words
 job.
 
first words solomon (ecclesiastes 12.7.) "then
 shall dust return dust, was, spirit shall return to
 god gave it." may bear well enough (if text
 directly it) interpretation, god onely knows, (but
 man not,) becomes mans spirit, expireth; same
 solomon, book, (chap. 3. ver. 20,21.) delivereth same
 sentence sense given it: words are, "all goe, (man
 beast) place; dust, turn dust
 again; knoweth spirit man goeth upward, spirit
 beast goeth downward earth?" is, none knows god;
 unusuall phrase say things understand not, "god
 knows what," "god knows where." gen. 5.24. "enoch walked
 god, not; god took him;" expounded heb.
 13.5. "he translated, die; found,
 god translated him. translation, this
 testimony, pleased god," making much immortality
 body, soule, proveth, translation was
 peculiar please god; common wicked;
 depending grace, nature. contrary, what
 interpretation shall give, besides literall sense words of
 solomon (eccles. 3.19.) "that befalleth sons men, befalleth
 beasts, even one thing befalleth them; one dyeth, doth the
 other; yea, one breath (one spirit;) man hath no
 praeeminence beast, vanity." literall sense,
 naturall immortality soule; yet repugnancy
 life eternall, elect shall enjoy grace. (chap.
 4. ver.3.) "better hath yet been, they;" that
 is, live, lived; which, soule them
 lived, immortall, hard saying; have
 immortall soule, worse soule all. and
 againe,(chapt. 9.5.) "the living know shall die, dead know
 thing;" is, naturally, resurrection the
 body.
 
another place seems make naturall immortality the
 soule, that, saviour saith, abraham, isaac, jacob
 living: spoken promise god, their
 certitude rise again, life actuall; same
 sense god said adam, day hee eate the
 forbidden fruit, certainly die; time forward was
 dead man sentence; execution, till almost thousand
 years after. abraham, isaac, jacob alive promise, then,
 christ spake; actually till resurrection. the
 history dives lazarus, make nothing this, wee take it
 (as is) parable.
 
places new testament, immortality
 seemeth directly attributed wicked. evident, that
 shall rise judgement. said besides many places,
 shall goe "everlasting fire, everlasting torments,
 everlasting punishments; worm conscience never dyeth;"
 comprehended word everlasting death, is
 ordinarily interpreted everlasting life torments: yet can find
 man shall live torments everlastingly. also, it
 seemeth hard, say, god father mercies, doth
 heaven earth hee will; hath hearts men
 disposing; worketh men doe, will; and
 without whose free gift man hath neither inclination good, nor
 repentance evill, punish mens transgressions without end
 time, extremity torture, men can imagine,
 more. therefore consider, meaning is, of
 everlasting fire, like phrases scripture.
 
shewed already, kingdome god christ beginneth at
 day judgment: day, faithfull shall rise again,
 glorious, spirituall bodies, bee subjects his
 kingdome, shall eternall; shall neither marry, nor
 given marriage, eate drink, naturall
 bodies; live ever individuall persons, without the
 specificall eternity generation: reprobates also shall
 rise again, receive punishments sins: also, those
 elect, shall alive earthly bodies that
 day, shall bodies suddenly changed, made spirituall, and
 immortall. bodies reprobate, make kingdome
 satan, shall also glorious, spirituall bodies, they
 shall bee angels god, neither eating, drinking, nor
 engendring; life shall eternall individuall
 persons, life every faithfull man is, life adam
 hee sinned, place scripture prove
 it; save onely places concerning eternall torments; may
 otherwise interpreted.
 
whence may inferred, elect resurrection
 shall restored estate, wherein adam sinned;
 reprobate shall estate, adam, posterity
 committed; saving god promised redeemer to
 adam, seed trust him, repent; not
 die sins, reprobate.
 



eternall torments what
 
things considered, texts mention eternall fire, eternal
 torments, word never dieth, contradict doctrine of
 second, everlasting death, proper naturall sense the
 word death. fire, torments prepared wicked gehenna,
 tophet, place soever, may continue ever; may
 never want wicked men tormented them; though every, nor
 one eternally. wicked left estate in
 adams sin, may resurrection live did, marry, and
 give marriage, grosse corruptible bodies, all
 mankind now have; consequently may engender perpetually, the
 resurrection, before: place scripture to
 contrary. st. paul, speaking resurrection (1 cor. 15.)
 understandeth onely resurrection life eternall; the
 resurrection punishment. first, saith body is
 "sown corruption, raised incorruption; sown dishonour, raised
 honour; sown weaknesse, raised power; sown naturall body,
 raised spirituall body:" thing can said the
 bodies rise punishment. text luke 20. verses
 34,35,36. fertile text. "the children world marry, are
 given marriage; shall counted worthy obtaine that
 world, resurrection dead, neither marry, given
 marriage: neither can die more; equall to
 angells, children god, children the
 resurrection:" children world, estate
 adam left in, shall marry, given marriage; is
 corrupt, generate successively; immortality kind,
 persons men: worthy counted amongst
 shall obtain next world, absolute resurrection from
 dead; onely short time, inmates world; the
 end onely receive condign punishment contumacy. elect
 onely children resurrection; say sole
 heirs eternall life: can die more; are
 equall angels, children god; the
 reprobate. reprobate remaineth resurrection,
 second, eternall death: resurrection, their
 second, eternall death, time punishment torment; and
 last succession sinners thereunto, long kind man
 propagation shall endure, eternally.
 



answer texts alledged purgatory
 
upon doctrine naturall eternity separated soules, is
 founded (as said) doctrine purgatory. supposing eternall
 life grace onely, life, life body; no
 immortality till resurrection. texts purgatory alledged by
 bellarmine canonicall scripture old testament, are
 first, fasting david saul jonathan, mentioned (2 kings,
 1. 12.); againe, (2 sam. 3. 35.) death abner. this
 fasting david, saith, obtaining something them
 gods hands, death; fasted procure
 recovery owne child, assoone know dead, he
 called meate. seeing soule hath existence separate from
 body, nothing can obtained mens fasting soules
 already either heaven, hell, followeth be
 soules dead men, neither heaven, hell; and
 therefore must bee third place, must purgatory.
 thus hard straining, hee wrested places proofe
 purgatory; whereas manifest, ceremonies mourning,
 fasting, used death men, whose life was
 profitable mourners, used honours sake their
 persons; tis done death whose life the
 mourners benefit, proceeds particular dammage: so
 david honoured saul, abner, fasting; death of
 owne child, recomforted himselfe, receiving ordinary food.
 
places, alledgeth old testament, there
 much shew, colour proofe. brings every text
 wherein word anger, fire, burning, purging, or
 clensing, case fathers sermon rhetorically
 applied doctrine purgatory, already beleeved. first
 verse psalme, 37. "o lord rebuke thy wrath, chasten me
 thy hot displeasure:" purgatory, augustine had
 applied wrath fire hell, displeasure, that
 purgatory? purgatory, psalme, 66. 12. "wee
 went fire water, thou broughtest us moist place;"
 like texts, (with doctors times
 entended adorne, extend sermons, commentaries) haled to
 purposes force wit?
 



places new testament purgatory answered
 
alledgeth places new testament, not
 easie answered: first matth. 12.32. "whosoever
 speaketh word sonne man, shall forgiven him; but
 whosoever speaketh holy ghost, shall bee forgiven
 neither world, world come:" will have
 purgatory world come, wherein sinnes may forgiven,
 world forgiven: notwithstanding is
 manifest, three worlds; one creation the
 flood, destroyed water, called scripture the
 old world; another flood day judgement, the
 present world, shall bee destroyed fire; third, which
 shall bee day judgement forward, everlasting, is
 called world come; agreed all, shall
 purgatory; therefore world come, purgatory, are
 inconsistent. can bee meaning saviours
 words? confesse hardly bee reconciled the
 doctrines now unanimously received: shame, confesse the
 profoundnesse scripture, bee great sounded the
 shortnesse humane understanding. neverthelesse, may propound such
 things consideration learned divines, text it
 selfe suggesteth. first, seeing speake holy ghost, as
 third person trinity, speake church,
 holy ghost resideth; seemeth comparison made,
 betweene easinesse saviour, bearing offences done to
 earth, severity pastors him,
 deny authority, holy
 ghost: say, deny power; nay shall
 crucifie me, shall pardoned mee, often turne unto mee by
 repentance: deny power teach hereafter,
 vertue holy ghost, shall inexorable, shall not
 forgive you, persecute world, leave without
 absolution, (though turn me, unlesse turn also them,) to
 punishments (as much lies them) world come: and
 words may taken prophecy, praediction concerning the
 times, along christian church: be
 meaning, (for peremptory difficult places,)
 perhaps may place left resurrection the
 repentance sinners: also another place, that
 seemeth agree therewith. considering words st. paul (1
 cor. 15. 29.) "what shall doe baptized dead, if
 dead rise all? also baptized dead?" a
 man may probably inferre, done, st. pauls time,
 custome receiving baptisme dead, (as men now
 beleeve, sureties undertakers faith infants, that
 capable beleeving,) undertake persons their
 deceased friends, ready obey, receive our
 saviour king, coming again; forgivenesse
 sins world come, need purgatory. both
 interpretations, much paradox, trust not
 them; propound throughly versed the
 scripture, inquire clearer place contradicts
 them. onely thus much, see evident scripture, perswade men, that
 neither word, thing purgatory, neither this,
 text; thing can prove necessity place
 soule without body; neither soule lazarus during
 four days dead; soules romane
 church pretend tormented now purgatory. god, could
 give life peece clay, hath power give life again
 dead man, renew inanimate, rotten carkasse, a
 glorious, spirituall, immortall body.
 
another place 1 cor. 3. said which
 built stubble, hay, &c. true foundation, work shall perish;
 "they shall saved; fire:" fire, he
 will fire purgatory. words, said before,
 allusion zach. 13. 9. saith, "i will bring
 third part fire, refine silver refined,
 will try gold tryed;" spoken comming of
 messiah power glory; is, day judgment, and
 conflagration present world; wherein elect shall be
 consumed, refined; is, depose erroneous doctrines, and
 traditions, sindged off; shall afterwards
 call upon name true god. like manner, apostle saith
 them, holding foundation jesus christ, shall build
 thereon doctrines erroneous, shall be
 consumed fire reneweth world, shall passe through
 salvation; so, see, relinquish former errours.
 builders, pastors; foundation, jesus christ;
 stubble hay, false consequences drawn ignorance,
 frailty; gold, silver, pretious stones, true
 doctrines; refining purging, relinquishing their
 errors. colour burning of
 incorporeall, say, impatible souls.
 



baptisme dead, understood
 
third place 1 cor. 15. mentioned, concerning
 baptisme dead: concludeth, first, prayers
 dead unprofitable; that, fire
 purgatory: neither rightly. many interpretations
 word baptisme, approveth first place, by
 baptisme meant (metaphorically) baptisme penance; men
 sense baptized, fast, pray, give almes:
 baptisme dead, prayer dead, thing.
 metaphor, example, neither in
 scripture, use language; also
 discordant harmony, scope scripture. word baptisme
 used (mar. 10. 38. & luk. 12. 59.) dipped ones own
 bloud, christ upon cross, apostles
 were, giving testimony him. hard say, prayer,
 fasting, almes, similitude dipping. used
 also mat. 3. 11. (which seemeth make somewhat purgatory) for
 purging fire. evident fire purging here
 mentioned, whereof prophet zachary speaketh (chap. 13.
 v. 9.) "i will bring third part fire, will refine
 them, &c." st. peter (1 epist. 1. 7.) "that triall
 faith, much precious gold perisheth,
 though tryed fire, might found unto praise, honour,
 glory appearing jesus christ;" st. paul (1 cor. 3.
 13.) fire shall trie every mans work sort is." but
 st. peter, st. paul speak fire shall second
 appearing christ; prophet zachary day judgment: and
 therefore place s. mat. may interpreted same; then
 will necessity fire purgatory.
 
another interpretation baptisme dead, i
 mentioned, preferreth second place of
 probability; thence also inferreth utility prayer the
 dead. resurrection, heard christ,
 beleeved him, may received christs kingdome; is
 vain, death, friends pray them,
 till risen. granting god, prayers the
 faithfull, may convert unto heard christ
 preached, consequently rejected christ, the
 charity men point, blamed; yet concludeth
 nothing purgatory, rise death life, one thing;
 rise purgatory life another; rising life
 life, life torments life joy.
 
fourth place mat. 5. 25. "agree thine adversary
 quickly, whilest thou art way him, lest time the
 adversary deliver thee officer, thou cast prison.
 verily say unto thee, thou shalt means come thence, till
 thou paid uttermost farthing." allegory, offender
 sinner; adversary judge god; way is
 life; prison grave; officer, death; which, the
 sinner shall rise life eternall, second death,
 till paid utmost farthing, christ pay his
 passion, full ransome manner sin, well lesser
 sins, greater crimes; made passion christ
 equally veniall.
 
fift place, matth. 5. 22. "whosoever angry his
 brother without cause, shall guilty judgment. whosoever
 shall say brother, racha, shall guilty councel. but
 whosoever shall say, thou foole, shall guilty hell fire." from
 words inferreth three sorts sins, three sorts of
 punishments; none sins, last, shall be
 punished hell fire; consequently, life, there
 punishment lesser sins purgatory. inference, is
 colour interpretation hath yet given them: shall
 distinction life courts justice, there
 amongst jews saviours time, hear, determine
 divers sorts crimes; judges, councell? shall not
 judicature appertain christ, apostles? understand
 therefore text, consider solitarily, jointly
 words precedent, subsequent. saviour chapter
 interpreteth law moses; jews thought then
 fulfilled, transgressed grammaticall sense
 thereof, howsoever transgressed sentence, or
 meaning legislator. therefore whereas thought sixth
 commandement broken, killing man; seventh, but
 man lay woman, wife; saviour tells them, the
 inward anger man brother, without just cause,
 homicide: heard (saith hee) law moses, "thou shalt
 kill," "whosoever shall kill, shall condemned the
 judges," session seventy: say unto you, to
 angry ones brother without cause; say unto racha, or
 foole, homicide, shall punished day judgment, and
 session christ, apostles, hell fire: words
 used distinguish divers crimes, divers courts
 justice, divers punishments; taxe distinction between
 sin, sin, jews drew difference will
 obeying god, difference temporall courts of
 justice; shew will hurt brother,
 though effect appear reviling, all, shall cast
 hell fire, judges, session, shall the
 same, different courts day judgment. considered, what
 can drawn text, maintain purgatory, imagine.
 
sixth place luke 16. 9. "make yee friends unrighteous
 mammon, yee faile, may receive everlasting
 tabernacles." alledges prove invocation saints departed.
 sense plain, make friends riches, of
 poore, thereby obtain prayers whilest live. "he that
 giveth poore, lendeth lord. "the seventh luke 23. 42.
 "lord remember thou commest thy kingdome:" therefore, saith
 hee, remission sins life. consequence
 good. saviour forgave him; comming againe in
 glory, will remember raise againe life eternall.
 
eight acts 2. 24. st. peter saith christ, "that god
 raised up, loosed paines death, not
 possible holden it;" hee interprets bee a
 descent christ purgatory, loose soules their
 torments; whereas manifest, christ loosed;
 hee bee holden death, grave; the
 souls purgatory. beza sayes notes this
 place well observed, none will see, stead

chapter xlv. daemonology, reliques religion the
 gentiles
 



originall daemonology
 
impression made organs sight, lucide bodies, either in
 one direct line, many lines, reflected opaque, refracted
 passage diaphanous bodies, produceth living creatures,
 god hath placed organs, imagination object, from
 whence impression proceedeth; imagination called sight; and
 seemeth bee meer imagination, body selfe without
 us; manner, man violently presseth eye, there
 appears light without, him, man perceiveth
 himselfe; indeed thing without him, but
 onely motion interiour organs, pressing resistance
 outward, makes think so. motion made pressure,
 continuing object caused removed, call
 imagination, memory, (in sleep, sometimes great distemper
 organs sicknesse, violence) dream: things have
 already spoken briefly, second third chapters.
 
nature sight never discovered ancient
 pretenders naturall knowledge; much lesse consider not
 things remote (as knowledge is) present use; was
 hard men conceive images fancy, sense,
 otherwise, things really without us: (because they
 vanish away, know whither, how,) will absolutely
 incorporeall, say immateriall, formes without matter;
 colour figure, without coloured figured body; they
 can put aiery bodies (as garment) make visible when
 will bodily eyes; others say, bodies, living
 creatures, made air, subtile aethereall matter,
 is, then, will seen, condensed. them
 agree one generall appellation them, daemons. dead of
 dreamed, inhabitants brain, the
 air, heaven, hell; phantasmes, ghosts; just
 much reason, one say, saw ghost a
 looking-glasse, ghosts stars river; call the
 ordinary apparition sun, quantity foot, the
 daemon, ghost great sun enlighteneth whole visible
 world: means feared them, things unknown, that
 is, unlimited power doe good, harme; consequently,
 given occasion governours heathen common-wealths to
 regulate fear, establishing daemonology (in which
 poets, principal priests heathen religion, specially
 employed, reverenced) publique peace, obedience of
 subjects necessary thereunto; make good daemons,
 others evill; one spurre observance, other, as
 reines withhold violation laws.
 



daemons ancients
 
kind things were, attributed name of
 daemons, appeareth partly genealogie gods, written by
 hesiod, one ancient poets graecians; partly in
 histories; observed before, 12.
 chapter discourse.
 



doctrine spread
 
graecians, colonies conquests, communicated their
 language writings asia, egypt, italy; therein, by
 necessary consequence daemonology, (as st. paul calles it)
 "their doctrines devils;" meanes, contagion was
 derived also jewes, judaea, alexandria, other
 parts, whereinto dispersed. name daemon did
 (as graecians) attribute spirits good, evill; but
 evill onely: good daemons gave name the
 spirit god; esteemed whose bodies entred be
 prophets. summe, singularity good, attributed the
 spirit god; evill, daemon, kakodaimen, evill
 daemon, is, devill. therefore, called daemoniaques, that
 is, possessed devill, call madmen lunatiques; or
 falling sicknesse; spoke thing, they
 want understanding, thought absurd: also unclean person
 notorious degree, used say unclean spirit; a
 dumbe man, dumbe devill; john baptist (math. 11.
 18.) singularity fasting, devill; of
 saviour, said, hee keepeth sayings not
 see death aeternum, (john 8. 52.) "now know thou hast devill;
 abraham dead, prophets dead:" again, said
 (john 7. 20.) "they went kill him," people answered, "thou
 hast devill, goeth kill thee?" whereby manifest,
 jewes opinions concerning phantasmes, namely, that
 phantasmes is, idols braine, things reall,
 independent fancy.
 



saviour controlled not
 
doctrine true, (may say) saviour
 contradict it, teach contrary? nay use diverse
 occasions, forms speech seem confirm it? answer,
 first, christ saith, "a spirit hath flesh bone,"
 though hee shew spirits, yet denies are
 bodies: st. paul sais, "we shall rise spirituall bodies," he
 acknowledgeth nature spirits, bodily spirits;
 difficult understand. air many things
 bodies, though flesh bone, grosse body, bee
 discerned eye. saviour speaketh devill, and
 commandeth go man, devill, meant disease,
 phrenesy, lunacy, corporeal spirit, speech
 improper? can diseases heare? can corporeall spirit a
 body flesh bone, full already vitall animall spirits?
 therefore spirits, neither bodies, meer
 imaginations? first answer, addressing saviours
 command madnesse, lunacy cureth, improper, then
 rebuking fever, wind, sea; neither
 hear: command god, light, the
 firmament, sunne, starres, commanded bee; for
 heare beeing. speeches are
 improper, signifie power gods word: more
 therefore improper, command madnesse, lunacy (under the
 appellation devils, commonly understood,)
 depart mans body. second, concerning being
 incorporeall, yet observed place scripture, from
 whence can gathered, man ever possessed any
 corporeal spirit, owne, body is
 naturally moved.
 



scriptures doe teach spirits incorporeall
 
saviour, immediately holy ghost descended upon the
 form dove, said st. matthew (chapt. 4. 1.) "led
 spirit wildernesse;" recited (luke 4.
 1.) words, "jesus full holy ghost, led in
 spirit wildernesse;" whereby evident, by
 spirit there, meant holy ghost. interpreted for
 possession: christ, holy ghost, one same
 substance; possession one substance, body, another.
 whereas verses following, said "to taken
 devill holy city, set upon pinnacle the
 temple," shall conclude thence hee possessed devill,
 carryed thither violence? again, "carryed thence devill
 exceeding high mountain, shewed thence the
 kingdomes world:" herein, wee beleeve either
 possessed, forced devill; mountaine high
 enough, (according literall sense,) shew one whole
 hemisphere. can meaning place, that
 went wildernesse; carrying him
 down, wildernesse city, thence a
 mountain, vision? conformable whereunto, also phrase st.
 luke, hee led wildernesse, by, spirit:
 whereas concerning taken mountaine, unto the
 pinnacle temple, hee speaketh st. matthew doth. suiteth
 nature vision.
 
again, st. luke sayes judas iscariot, "satan entred into
 him, thereupon went communed chief priests, and
 captaines, might betray christ unto them:" may answered,
 entring satan (that enemy) him, meant, the
 hostile traiterous intention selling lord master. as
 holy ghost, frequently scripture understood, graces and
 good inclinations given holy ghost; entring of
 satan, may bee understood wicked cogitations, designes the
 adversaries christ, disciples. hard say,
 devill entred judas, hostile
 designe; impertinent say, first christs enemy his
 heart, devill entred afterwards. therefore the
 entring satan, wicked purpose, one thing.
 
immateriall spirit, possession mens bodies
 spirit corporeall, may asked, saviour his
 apostles teach people so; cleer words, they
 might doubt thereof. questions these, more
 curious, necessary christian mans salvation. men may well
 aske, christ given men faith, piety, all
 manner morall vertues, gave onely, all: and
 left search naturall causes, sciences, naturall
 reason industry men, reveal all, man
 supernaturally; many questions: neverthelesse
 may alledged probable pious reasons. god, he
 brought israelites land promise, secure them
 therein, subduing nations round them; left many of
 them, thornes sides, awaken time time their
 piety industry: saviour, conducting us toward heavenly
 kingdome, destroy difficulties naturall questions;
 left exercise industry, reason; scope of
 preaching, onely shew us plain direct way to
 salvation, namely, beleef article, "that christ,
 living god, sent world sacrifice himselfe for
 sins, comming again, gloriously reign elect,
 save enemies eternally:" which, opinion
 possession spirits, phantasmes, impediment way;
 though occasion going way, follow
 inventions. wee require scripture account all
 questions, may raised trouble us performance gods
 commands; may well complaine moses set downe the
 time creation spirits, well creation the
 earth, sea, men, beasts. conclude, find scripture
 angels, spirits, good evill; are
 incorporeall, apparitions men see dark, dream,
 vision; latines call spectra, took daemons. i
 find spirits corporeal, (though subtile invisible;)
 mans body possessed, inhabited them; that
 bodies saints shall such, namely, spirituall bodies, as
 st. paul calls them.
 



power casting devills, primitive
 church
 
neverthelesse, contrary doctrine, namely, incorporeall
 spirits, hath hitherto prevailed church, use of
 exorcisme, (that say, ejection devills conjuration) is
 thereupon built; (though rarely faintly practised) yet
 totally given over. many daemoniaques primitive
 church, mad-men, singular diseases; whereas in
 times hear of, see many mad-men, daemoniaques,
 proceeds change nature; names. comes
 passe, whereas heretofore apostles, a
 time, pastors church, cure singular diseases, which
 now seen doe; likewise, power of
 every true beleever now, doe faithfull then, is
 say, read (mark 16. 17.) "in christs name cast devills,
 speak new tongues, take serpents, drink deadly poison
 without harm taking, cure sick laying their
 hands," without words, "in name jesus,"
 another question. probable, extraordinary gifts
 given church, longer time, men trusted wholly
 christ, looked felicity onely kingdome come;
 consequently, sought authority, riches, and
 trusted subtilty kingdome world, these
 supernaturall gifts god taken them.
 



another relique gentilisme, worshipping images, left church,
 brought it
 
another relique gentilisme, worship images, neither
 instituted moses old, christ new testament; nor
 yet brought gentiles; left amongst them, had
 given names christ. saviour preached, the
 generall religion gentiles, worship gods, apparences
 remain brain impression externall bodies upon
 organs senses, commonly called ideas, idols,
 phantasmes, conceits, representations externall
 bodies, cause them, nothing reality, more
 things seem stand us dream:
 reason st. paul says, "wee know idol is
 nothing:" thought image metall, stone, wood,
 nothing; thing honored, feared in
 image, held god, meer figment, without place,
 habitation, motion, existence, motions brain.
 worship divine honour, the
 scripture called idolatry, rebellion god. god king
 jews, lieutenant first moses, afterward the
 high priest; people permitted worship, pray to
 images, (which representations fancies,) had
 farther dependence true god, can no
 similitude; prime ministers, moses, high priests;
 every man governed according appetite, the
 utter eversion common-wealth, destruction want
 union. therefore first law god was, "they take
 gods, alienos deos, is, gods nations, that
 onely true god, vouchsafed commune moses, give
 laws directions, peace, salvation
 enemies." second was, "they make to
 image worship, invention." the
 deposing king, submit another king, whether set up
 neighbour nation, selves.
 



answer certain seeming texts images
 
places scripture pretended countenance setting of
 images, worship them; set places where
 god worshipped, first, two examples; one cherubins over
 ark god; brazen serpent: secondly, texts
 whereby commanded worship certain creatures relation
 god; worship footstool: lastly, texts, by
 authorized, religious honoring holy things. i
 examine force places, prove pretended, i
 must first explain understood worshipping, by
 images, idols.
 



worship
 
already shewn 20 chapter discourse, honor,
 value highly power person: value is
 measured, comparing others. nothing
 compared god power; honor dishonour him
 value lesse infinite. thus honor properly own
 nature, secret, internall heart. inward thoughts of
 men, appeare outwardly words actions, signes
 honoring, goe name worship, latine,
 cultus. therefore, pray to, swear by, obey, bee diligent,
 officious serving: summe, words actions betoken
 fear offend, desire please, worship, whether words
 actions sincere, feigned: appear signes of
 honoring, ordinarily also called honor.
 



distinction divine civill worship
 
worship exhibite esteem men, kings,
 men authority, civill worship: worship exhibite
 think bee god, whatsoever words, ceremonies,
 gestures, actions be, divine worship. fall prostrate
 king, thinks man, civill worship:
 putteth hat church, cause, that
 thinketh house god, worshippeth divine worship. they
 seek distinction divine civill worship, the
 intention worshipper, words douleia, latreia,
 deceive themselves. whereas two sorts servants; that
 sort, absolutely power their
 masters, slaves taken war, issue, whose bodies not
 power, (their lives depending will masters,
 manner forfeit upon least disobedience,) that
 bought sold beasts, called douloi, properly,
 slaves, service, douleia: other, that
 serve (for hire, hope benefit masters) voluntarily;
 called thetes; is, domestique servants; whose service the
 masters right, contained covenants made
 betwixt them. two kinds servants thus much common them
 both, labour appointed another, whether, a
 slave, voluntary servant: word latris, general name
 both, signifying worketh another, whether, slave,
 voluntary servant: latreia signifieth generally all
 service; douleia service bondmen onely, condition of
 slavery: used scripture (to signifie service god)
 promiscuously. douleia, gods slaves; latreia, because
 wee serve him: kinds service contained, onely
 obedience, also worship, is, actions, gestures, words,
 signifie honor.
 



image phantasmes
 
image (in strict signification word) the
 resemblance thing visible: sense phantasticall
 formes, apparitions, seemings visible bodies sight, are
 onely images; shew man, thing the
 water, reflexion, refraction; sun, stars direct
 vision air; nothing reall things seen, in
 place thy seem bee; magnitudes figures
 object; changeable, variation of
 organs sight, glasses; present oftentimes our
 imagination, dreams, object absent; changed
 colours, shapes, things depend onely upon the
 fancy. images originally properly
 called ideas, idols, derived language graecians,
 word eido signifieth see. also called
 phantasmes, language, apparitions. these
 images one faculties mans nature, called the
 imagination. hence manifest, neither is, nor
 can bee image made thing invisible.
 
also evident, can image thing infinite: for
 images, phantasmes made impression things
 visible, figured: figure quantity every way determined: and
 therefore can bee image god: soule man; of
 spirits, onely bodies visible, is, bodies light in
 themselves, enlightened.
 



fictions; materiall images
 
whereas man can fancy shapes never saw; making figure out
 parts divers creatures; poets make centaures,
 chimaeras, monsters never seen: can also give matter to
 shapes, make wood, clay metall. also
 called images, resemblance corporeall thing, for
 resemblance phantasticall inhabitants brain the
 maker. idols, originally brain, and
 painted, carved, moulded, moulten matter, a
 similitude one other, materiall body made
 art, may said image phantasticall idoll made by
 nature.
 
larger use word image, contained also, any
 representation one thing another. earthly soveraign may be
 called image god: inferiour magistrate image an
 earthly soveraign. many times idolatry gentiles there
 little regard similitude materiall idoll the
 idol fancy, yet called image it. a
 stone unhewn set neptune, divers shapes far
 different shapes conceived gods. this
 day see many images virgin mary, saints, unlike one
 another, without correspondence one mans fancy; yet serve
 well enough purpose erected for; but
 names onely, represent persons mentioned history;
 every man applyeth mentall image owne making, or
 none all. thus image largest sense, either the
 resemblance, representation thing visible; both
 together, happeneth part.
 
name idoll extended yet scripture, to
 signifie also sunne, starre, creature, visible or
 invisible, worshipped gods.
 



idolatry what
 
shewn worship, image; will now put them
 together, examine idolatry is, forbidden the
 second commandement, places scripture.
 
worship image, voluntarily doe externall acts, which
 signes honoring either matter image, wood,
 stone, metall, visible creature; phantasme of
 brain, resemblance, representation whereof, matter
 formed figured; together, one animate body, composed
 matter phantasme, body soule.
 
uncovered, man power authority, the
 throne prince, places hee ordaineth that
 purpose absence, worship man, prince civill
 worship; signe, honoring stoole, place, the

 soule prince stool, present petition to
 stool, divine worship, idolatry.
 
pray king things, hee able doe us, though
 prostrate selves him, civill worship; we
 acknowledge power him, humane: voluntarily pray
 unto fair weather, thing god onely can doe

 compell man terrour death, great corporall
 punishment, idolatry: worship soveraign
 commandeth bee done unto terrour laws, not
 sign obeyeth him, inwardly honour god, but
 desirous save himselfe death, miserable
 life; sign internall honor, worship;
 therefore idolatry. neither can bee said, hee does
 it, scandalizeth, layeth stumbling block brother;
 wise, learned soever worshippeth that
 manner, another man thence argue, approveth it; but
 doth fear; act, act the
 soveraign.
 
worship god, peculiar place, turning mans face towards
 image, determinate place, worship, honor place,
 image; acknowledge holy, say, acknowledge
 image, place set apart common use: the
 meaning word holy; implies new quality place, or
 image; onely new relation appropriation god; therefore
 idolatry; idolatry worship god before
 brazen serpent; jews owne
 countrey, turn faces (when prayed) toward temple of
 jerusalem; moses put shoes the
 flaming bush, ground appertaining mount sinai; place god
 chosen appear in, give laws people israel,
 therefore holy ground, inhaerent sanctity, by
 separation gods use; christians worship churches,
 solemnly dedicated god purpose, the
 authority king, true representant church. to
 worship god, inanimating, inhibiting, image, place; that
 say, infinite substance finite place, idolatry: for
 finite gods, idols brain, nothing reall; are
 commonly called scripture names vanity, lyes, and
 nothing. also worship god, inanimating, present the
 place, image; end put mind him, some
 works his, case place, image dedicated, set up
 private authority, authority our
 soveraign pastors, idolatry. commandement is, "thou shalt not
 make thy selfe graven image." god commanded moses set the
 brazen serpent; hee make himselfe; therefore
 commandement. making golden calfe aaron,
 people, done without authority god, idolatry;
 onely held god, also made it
 religious use, without warrant either god soveraign, or
 moses, lieutenant.
 
gentiles worshipped gods, jupiter, others; living, were
 men perhaps done great glorious acts; children
 god, divers men women, supposing gotten immortall
 deity, mortall man. idolatry, made so
 themselves, authority god, neither eternall law
 reason, positive revealed will. though saviour
 man, wee also beleeve bee god immortall, of
 god; yet idolatry; wee build beleef upon
 fancy, judgment, upon word god revealed the
 scriptures. adoration eucharist, words of
 christ, "this body," signifie, "that himselfe, seeming
 bread hand; onely so, seeming morsells
 bread ever since been, time hereafter shall bee
 consecrated priests, bee many christs bodies, yet them
 one body," idolatry, authorized our
 saviour: text doe signifie that, (for other
 can alledged it,) then, worship humane
 institution, idolatry. enough say, god can
 transubstantiate bread christs body: gentiles also held
 god omnipotent; might upon ground lesse excuse their
 idolatry, pretending, well others, transubstantiation of
 wood, stone god almighty.
 
whereas be, pretend divine inspiration, supernaturall
 entring holy ghost man, acquisition gods
 grace, doctrine, study; think dangerous
 dilemma. worship men beleeve so
 inspired, fall impiety; adoring gods supernaturall
 presence. again, worship them, commit idolatry; the
 apostles never permit worshipped. therefore
 safest way beleeve, descending dove upon
 apostles; christs breathing them, hee gave them
 holy ghost; giving imposition hands, are
 understood signes god hath pleased use, ordain to
 used, promise assist persons study to
 preach kingdome, conversation, might be
 scandalous, edifying others.
 



scandalous worship images
 
besides idolatrous worship images, also scandalous
 worship them; also sin; idolatry. idolatry is
 worship signes internall, reall honour: scandalous
 worship, seeming worship; may sometimes bee joined with
 inward, hearty detestation, image, the
 phantasticall daemon, idol, dedicated; proceed
 onely fear death, grievous punishment; is
 neverthelesse worship, case men whose
 actions looked others, lights guide by; because
 following ways, stumble, fall way of
 religion: whereas example regard not, works us
 all, leaves us diligence caution; consequently
 causes falling.
 
therefore pastor lawfully called teach direct others, any
 other, whose knowledge great opinion, doe externall honor
 idol fear; unlesse make feare, unwillingnesse to
 it, evident worship; scandalizeth brother, seeming
 approve idolatry. brother, arguing action his
 teacher, whose knowledge esteemeth great, concludes it
 bee lawfull selfe. scandall, sin, scandall
 given. one pastor, eminent reputation for
 knowledge christian doctrine, doe same, another follow him;
 scandall given; cause follow example:
 pretence scandall hee taketh himselfe excuse
 men: unlearned man, power idolatrous
 king, state, commanded pain death worship an
 idoll, hee detesteth idoll heart, hee doth well; though he
 fortitude suffer death, rather worship it, should
 doe better. pastor, christs messenger, undertaken to
 teach christs doctrine nations, doe same, were
 onely sinfull scandall, respect christian mens
 consciences, perfidious forsaking charge.
 
summe said hitherto, concerning worship of
 images, that, worshippeth image, creature,
 either matter thereof, fancy own, thinketh
 dwell it; together; beleeveth things hear
 prayers, see devotions, without ears, eyes, committeth
 idolatry: counterfeiteth worship fear of
 punishment, bee man whose example hath power amongst his
 brethren, committeth sin: worshippeth creator the
 world image, place hath made, or
 chosen himselfe, taken commandement gods word, the
 jewes worshipping god cherubins, brazen
 serpent time, in, towards temple jerusalem, which
 also time, committeth idolatry.
 
now worship saints, images, reliques, other
 things day practised church rome, say not
 allowed word god, brought church rome, from
 doctrine taught; partly left first conversion
 gentiles; afterwards countenanced, confirmed, and
 augmented bishops rome.
 



answer argument cherubins, brazen serpent
 
proofs alledged scripture, namely, examples
 images appointed god bee set up; set the
 people, man worship; worship god himselfe
 them: cherubins ark, brazen
 serpent. read not, priest, worship the
 cherubins; contrarily wee read (2 kings 18.4.) hezekiah brake
 pieces brazen serpent moses set up, the
 people burnt incense it. besides, examples put for
 imitation, also set images, pretence
 worshipping god them; words second
 commandement, "thou shalt make thy selfe graven image, &c."
 distinguish images god commanded set up, and
 wee set selves. therefore cherubins,
 brazen serpent, images mans devising; worship
 commanded god, will-worship men, argument good.
 also bee considered, hezekiah brake pieces the
 brazen serpent, jews worship it, end should
 doe more; also christian soveraigns break the
 images subjects accustomed worship; there
 occasion idolatry. day, ignorant
 people, images worshipped, doe really beleeve a
 divine power images; told pastors, some
 spoken; bled; miracles done by
 them; apprehend done saint, think either
 image self, it. israelites, worshipped the
 calfe, think worshipped god brought egypt;
 yet idolatry, thought calfe either was
 god, belly. though man may think it
 impossible people stupid, think image be
 god, saint; worship notion; yet manifest
 scripture contrary; golden calfe made, the
 people said, (exod. 32. 2.) "these thy gods israel;" the
 images laban (gen. 31.30.) called gods. wee see daily by
 experience sorts people, men study nothing but
 food ease, content beleeve absurdity, rather than
 trouble examine it; holding faith by
 entaile unalienable, except expresse new law.
 



painting fancies idolatry: abusing religious worship is
 
inferre places, lawfull paint
 angels, also god himselfe: gods walking garden; from
 jacobs seeing god top ladder; visions, and
 dreams. visions, dreams whether naturall, supernaturall, are
 phantasmes: painteth image them, maketh not
 image god, phantasm, is, making idol. i
 say not, draw picture fancy, sin; it
 drawn, hold representation god, second
 commandement; can use, worship. may be
 said images angels, men dead; unlesse monuments of
 friends, men worthy remembrance: use image, not
 worship image; civill honoring person, is,
 was: done image make saint,
 reason, think heareth prayers, is
 pleased honour wee doe him, dead, without sense, wee
 attribute humane power; therefore idolatry.
 
seeing therefore authority, neither law moses,
 gospel, religious worship images, other
 representations god, men set themselves; the
 worship image creature heaven, earth, the
 earth: whereas christian kings, living representants god,
 worshipped subjects, act, signifieth
 greater esteem power, nature mortall man capable
 of; imagined, religious worship now use,
 brought church, misunderstanding scripture. it
 resteth therefore, left it, destroying images
 themselves, conversion gentiles worshipped them.
 



idolatry left church
 
cause whereof, immoderate esteem, prices set upon the
 workmanship them, made owners (though converted, from
 worshipping done religiously daemons) retain
 still houses, upon pretence honor of
 christ, virgin mary, apostles, pastors
 primitive church; easie, giving new names, to
 make image virgin mary, sonne saviour,
 perhaps called image venus, cupid; of
 jupiter make barnabas, mercury paul, like. and
 worldly ambition creeping degrees pastors, drew to
 endeavour pleasing new made christians; also liking
 kind honour, also might hope their
 decease, well already gained it: worshipping
 images christ apostles, grow idolatrous;
 save somewhat time constantine, divers emperors, and
 bishops, generall councells observed, opposed unlawfulnesse
 thereof; late, weakly.
 



canonizing saints
 
canonizing saints, another relique gentilisme: is
 neither misunderstanding scripture, new invention the
 roman church, custome ancient common-wealth rome it
 self. first ever canonized rome, romulus, that
 upon narration julius proculus, swore senate,
 spake death, assured him, dwelt in
 heaven, called quirinius, propitious to
 state new city: thereupon senate gave publique
 testimony sanctity. julius caesar, emperors him,
 like testimony; is, canonized saints; now defined;
 apotheosis heathen.
 



name pontifex
 
also roman heathen, popes received the
 name, power pontifex maximus. name in
 ancient common-wealth rome, supreme authority under
 senate people, regulating ceremonies, doctrines
 concerning religion: augustus caesar changed state
 monarchy, took himselfe office, that
 tribune people, (than say, supreme power in
 state, religion;) succeeding emperors enjoyed same. but
 emperour constantine lived, first professed
 authorized christian religion, consonant profession,
 cause religion regulated (under authority) bishop
 rome: though doe appear soon name pontifex;
 rather, succeeding bishops took themselves, to
 countenance power exercised bishops roman
 provinces. priviledge st. peter, priviledge
 city rome, emperors alwaies willing uphold;
 gave authority bishops; may evidently
 seen that, bishop constantinople, emperour made
 city seat empire, pretended bee equall bishop
 rome; though last, without contention, pope carryed it,
 became pontifex maximus; right onely emperour; and
 without bounds empire; where, emperour
 lost power rome; though pope took
 power him. whence wee may way observe, there
 place superiority pope bishops, except
 territories whereof civill soveraign; where
 emperour soveraign power civill, hath expressely chosen the
 pope chief pastor himselfe, christian subjects.
 



procession images
 
carrying images procession, another relique the
 religion greeks, romans: also carried their
 idols place place, kind chariot, peculiarly
 dedicated use, latines called thensa, vehiculum
 deorum; image placed frame, shrine, they
 called ferculum: called pompa, that
 now named procession: according whereunto, amongst divine honors
 given julius caesar senate, one, in
 pompe (or procession) circaean games, thensam
 & ferculum, sacred chariot, shrine; much, be
 carried god: just day popes carried
 switzers canopie.
 



wax candles, torches lighted
 
processions also belonged bearing burning torches, and
 candles, images gods, amongst greeks, and
 romans. afterwards emperors rome received honor; as
 read caligula, reception empire, carried
 misenum rome, midst throng people, wayes
 beset altars, beasts sacrifice, burning torches: and
 caracalla received alexandria incense, with
 casting flowers, dadouchiais, is, torches; dadochoi
 amongst greeks carried torches lighted the
 processions gods: processe time, devout, but
 ignorant people, many times honor bishops like
 pompe wax candles, images saviour, saints,
 constantly, church self. thus came use wax
 candles; also established ancient councells.
 
heathens also aqua lustralis, say, holy water.
 church rome imitates also holy dayes. had
 bacchanalia; wakes, answering them: they
 saturnalia, carnevalls, shrove-tuesdays liberty
 servants: procession priapus; wee fetching in,
 erection, dancing may-poles; dancing one kind of
 worship: procession called ambarvalia; our
 procession fields rogation week. think that
 ceremonies left church, the
 first conversion gentiles: can the
 present call mind; man wel observe is
 delivered histories, concerning religious rites greeks
 romanes, doubt might find many old empty
 bottles gentilisme, doctors romane church, either
 negligence, ambition, filled new wine of
 christianity, will faile time break them.
 


chapter xlvi. darknesse vain philosophy, fabulous traditions
 



philosophy is
 
philosophy understood "the knowledge acquired reasoning, from
 manner generation thing, properties; from
 properties, possible way generation same; the
 end bee able produce, far matter, humane force permit,
 effects, humane life requireth." geometrician, the
 construction figures, findeth many properties thereof; from
 properties, new ways construction, reasoning; end
 able measure land water; infinite uses. so
 astronomer, rising, setting, moving sun, and
 starres, divers parts heavens, findeth causes day,
 night, different seasons year; whereby keepeth
 account time: like sciences.
 



prudence part philosophy
 
definition evident, account any
 part thereof, originall knowledge called experience, which
 consisteth prudence: attained reasoning, found
 well brute beasts, man; memory successions
 events times past, wherein omission every little
 circumstance altering effect, frustrateth expectation the
 prudent: whereas nothing produced reasoning aright, but
 generall, eternall, immutable truth.
 



false doctrine part philosophy
 
therefore give name false conclusions: he
 reasoneth aright words understandeth, can never conclude an
 error:
 


revelation supernaturall
 
man knows supernaturall revelation; it
 acquired reasoning:
 



learning taken upon credit authors
 
gotten reasoning authority books;
 reasoning cause effect, from
 effect cause; knowledge, faith.
 



beginnings progresse philosophy
 
faculty reasoning consequent use speech, was
 possible, generall truthes
 found reasoning, ancient almost language selfe. the
 savages america, without good morall sentences; also
 little arithmetick, adde, divide numbers too
 great: therefore philosophers. plants
 corn wine small quantity dispersed fields woods,
 men knew vertue, made use nourishment,
 planted apart fields, vineyards; time they
 fed akorns, drank water: also divers true,
 generall, profitable speculations beginning; the
 naturall plants humane reason: first in
 number; men lived upon grosse experience; method; is
 say, sowing, planting knowledge self, apart the
 weeds, common plants errour conjecture: cause it
 want leasure procuring necessities life, and
 defending neighbours, impossible, till
 erecting great common-wealths, otherwise. leasure
 mother philosophy; common-wealth, mother peace, and
 leasure: first great flourishing cities, first
 study philosophy. gymnosophists india, magi persia,
 priests chaldea egypt, counted ancient
 philosophers; countreys ancient kingdomes.
 philosophy risen graecians, people west,
 whose common-wealths (no greater perhaps lucca, geneva) had
 never peace, fears one another equall; the
 leasure observe thing one another. length, warre had
 united many graecian lesser cities, fewer, greater;
 began seven men, severall parts greece, get reputation
 wise; morall politique sentences; and
 others learning chaldeans egyptians, was
 astronomy, geometry. hear yet schools of
 philosophy.
 



schools philosophy amongst athenians
 
athenians overthrow persian armies, gotten
 dominion sea; thereby, islands, maritime
 cities archipelago, well asia europe; grown
 wealthy; employment, neither home, abroad, had
 little else employ in, either (as st. luke says, acts
 17.21.) "in telling hearing news," discoursing philosophy
 publiquely youth city. every master took place for
 purpose. plato certaine publique walks called academia, one
 academus: aristotle walk temple pan, called lycaeum:
 others stoa, covered walk, wherein merchants goods were
 brought land: others places; spent time of
 leasure, teaching disputing opinions: some
 place, get youth city together to
 hear talk. carneades also rome, when
 ambassadour: caused cato advise senate dispatch
 quickly, feare corrupting manners young men that
 delighted hear speak (as thought) fine things.
 
was, place taught, disputed,
 called schola, tongue signifieth leasure; their
 disputations, diatribae, say, passing time. also the
 philosophers name sects, from
 schools: followed plato’s doctrine, were
 called academiques; followers aristotle, peripatetiques, the
 walk hee taught in; zeno taught, stoiques, stoa:
 denominate men more-fields, pauls-church, and
 exchange, meet often, prate loyter.
 
neverthelesse, men much taken custome, time
 spread selfe europe, best part afrique; as
 schools publiquely erected, maintained lectures, and
 disputations, almost every common-wealth.
 



schools jews
 
also schools, anciently, before, time of
 saviour, amongst jews: schools law. for
 though called synagogues, say, congregations the
 people; yet much law every sabbath day read, expounded,
 disputed them, differed nature, name onely
 publique schools; onely jerusalem, every
 city gentiles, jews inhabited. schoole
 damascus, whereinto paul entred, persecute. others at
 antioch, iconium thessalonica, whereinto entred, dispute:
 synagogue libertines, cyrenians, alexandrians,
 cilicians, asia; say, schoole libertines,
 jewes, strangers jerusalem: schoole they
 disputed saint steven.
 



schoole graecians unprofitable
 
utility schools? science there
 day acquired readings disputings? wee have
 geometry, mother naturall science, wee not
 indebted schools. plato best philosopher
 greeks, forbad entrance schoole, not
 already measure geometricians. many studied that
 science great advantage mankind: mention of
 schools; sect geometricians; they
 passe name philosophers. naturall philosophy
 schools, rather dream science, set forth in
 senselesse insignificant language; avoided by
 will teach philosophy, without first attained great
 knowledge geometry: nature worketh motion; wayes,
 degrees whereof known, without knowledge the
 proportions properties lines, figures. morall
 philosophy description passions. rule of
 manners, without civill government, law nature; it,
 law civill; determineth honest, dishonest; is
 just, unjust; generally good, evill: whereas they
 make rules good, bad, liking, disliking: by
 means, great diversity taste, nothing generally
 agreed on; every one doth (as far dares) whatsoever seemeth
 good eyes, subversion common-wealth. logique
 bee method reasoning, nothing else captions
 words, inventions puzzle goe pose
 them. conclude nothing absurd, old philosophers
 (as cicero saith, one them) maintained.
 beleeve scarce thing can absurdly said
 naturall philosophy, now called aristotles
 metaphysiques, repugnant government, much hee
 hath said politiques; ignorantly, great part of
 ethiques.
 



schools jews unprofitable
 
schoole jews, originally schoole law moses;
 commanded (deut. 31.10.) end every seventh year, at
 feast tabernacles, read people, that
 might hear, learn it: therefore reading law (which
 use captivity) every sabbath day, had
 end, acquainting people commandements
 obey, expound unto writings the
 prophets. manifest, many reprehensions by
 saviour, corrupted text law their
 false commentaries, vain traditions; little understood the
 prophets, neither acknowledge christ, works he
 did; prophets prophecyed. lectures and
 disputations synagogues, turned doctrine law
 phantasticall kind philosophy, concerning incomprehensible
 nature god, spirits; compounded vain
 philosophy theology graecians, mingled own
 fancies, drawn obscurer places scripture, which
 might easily bee wrested purpose; fabulous
 traditions ancestors.
 



university is
 
now called university, joyning together, an
 incorporation one government many publique schools, one and
 town city. which, principal schools ordained for
 three professions, say, romane religion, the
 romane law, art medicine. study philosophy
 hath otherwise place, handmaid romane religion:
 since authority aristotle onely current there, that
 study properly philosophy, (the nature whereof dependeth on
 authors,) aristotelity. geometry, till late times it
 place all; subservient nothing rigide truth.
 man ingenuity owne nature, attained any
 degree perfection therein, hee commonly thought magician, and
 art diabolicall.
 



errors brought religion aristotles metaphysiques
 
now descend particular tenets vain philosophy, derived to
 universities, thence church, partly aristotle,
 partly blindnesse understanding; shall first consider their
 principles. certain philosophia prima, other
 philosophy depend; consisteth principally, right
 limiting significations appellations, names, are
 others universall: limitations serve avoid
 ambiguity, aequivocation reasoning; commonly called
 definitions; definitions body, time, place, matter,
 forme, essence, subject, substance, accident, power, act, finite,
 infinite, quantity, quality, motion, action, passion, divers others,
 necessary explaining mans conceptions concerning nature
 generation bodies. explication (that is, setling the
 meaning) which, like terms, commonly schools called
 metaphysiques; part philosophy aristotle, which
 hath title: another sense; signifieth
 much, "books written, placed naturall philosophy:"
 schools take books supernaturall philosophy: the
 word metaphysiques will bear senses. indeed is
 written, part far possibility being
 understood, repugnant naturall reason, whosoever
 thinketh thing bee understood it, must needs think it
 supernaturall.
 



errors concerning abstract essences
 
metaphysiques, mingled scripture make
 schoole divinity, wee told, world certaine
 essences separated bodies, call abstract essences, and
 substantiall formes: interpreting jargon, is
 need somewhat ordinary attention place. also i
 ask pardon used kind discourse, for
 applying selfe are. world, (i mean earth
 onely, denominates lovers worldly men, universe,
 is, whole masse things are) corporeall, that
 say, body; hath dimensions magnitude, namely, length,
 bredth, depth: also every part body, likewise body, hath
 like dimensions; consequently every part universe,
 body, body, part universe: and
 universe all, part it, nothing;
 consequently where. follow hence, spirits
 nothing: dimensions, therefore really bodies;
 though name common speech given bodies onely, are
 visible, palpable; is, degree opacity: for
 spirits, call incorporeall; name honour,
 may therefore piety bee attributed god himselfe; in
 wee consider attribute expresseth best nature, which
 incomprehensible; best expresseth desire honour him.
 
know now upon grounds say essences abstract, or
 substantiall formes, wee consider words properly
 signifie. use words, register selves, make
 manifest others thoughts conceptions minds. which
 words, names things conceived; names all
 sorts bodies, work upon senses, leave impression in
 imagination: others names imaginations themselves;
 say, ideas, mentall images things
 wee see, remember: others againe names names; of
 different sorts speech: universall, plurall, singular, negation,
 true, false, syllogisme, interrogation, promise, covenant, names
 certain forms speech. others serve shew consequence, or
 repugnance one name another; one saith, "a man body,"
 hee intendeth name body necessarily consequent the
 name man; severall names thing, man; which
 consequence signified coupling together word is.
 wee use verbe is; latines use verbe est, and
 greeks esti declinations. whether other
 nations world severall languages word that
 answereth it, not, tell; sure need
 it: placing two names order may serve signifie their
 consequence, custome, (for custome it, give words
 force,) well words is, bee, are, like.
 
so, language without verb
 answerable est, is, bee; yet men used bee
 jot lesse capable inferring, concluding, kind of
 reasoning, greeks, latines. become
 terms, entity, essence, essentiall, essentially, are
 derived it, many depend these, applyed most
 commonly are? therefore names things; signes, by
 wee make known, wee conceive consequence one name or
 attribute another: say, "a man, is, living body," wee
 mean man one thing, living body another, is,
 beeing third: man, living body, same
 thing: consequence, "if hee bee man, hee living
 body," true consequence, signified word is. therefore, to
 bee body, walke, bee speaking, live, see, like
 infinitives; also corporeity, walking, speaking, life, sight, the
 like, signifie just same, names nothing; have
 elsewhere amply expressed.
 
purpose (may man say) subtilty work of
 nature, pretend nothing necessary the
 doctrine government obedience? purpose, men
 may longer suffer abused, them, this
 doctrine separated essences, built vain philosophy of
 aristotle, fright obeying laws countrey,
 empty names; men fright birds corn empty
 doublet, hat, crooked stick. upon ground, that
 man dead buried, say soule (that life) can
 walk separated body, seen night amongst graves.
 upon ground say, figure, colour, tast of
 peece bread, being, there, say bread:
 upon ground say, faith, wisdome, other
 vertues sometimes powred man, sometimes blown from
 heaven; vertuous, vertues asunder; a
 great many things serve lessen dependance subjects
 soveraign power countrey. will endeavour obey
 laws, expect obedience powred blown him? who
 will obey priest, can make god, rather soveraign;
 nay god himselfe? who, fear ghosts, will bear
 great respect can make holy water, drives them
 him? shall suffice example errors, are
 brought church, entities, essences aristotle:
 may knew false philosophy; writ thing
 consonant to, corroborative religion; fearing fate
 socrates.
 
fallen error separated essences, are
 thereby necessarily involved many absurdities follow it.
 seeing will forms reall, obliged to
 assign place. hold incorporeall, without
 dimension quantity, men know place dimension, and
 filled, corporeall; driven to
 uphold credit distinction, indeed any
 circumscriptive, definitive: terms meer words, and
 occasion insignificant, passe onely latine, vanity
 may bee concealed. circumscription thing, is
 nothing else determination, defining place; so
 terms distinction same. particular, of
 essence man, (they say) soule, affirm it,
 little finger, every part
 (how small soever) body; yet soule whole body,
 one parts. can man think god served
 absurdities? yet necessary beleeve,
 will beleeve existence incorporeall soule,
 separated body.
 
come give account, incorporeall substance can
 capable pain, tormented fire hell, purgatory,
 nothing answer, known fire
 can burn soules.
 
again, whereas motion change place, incorporeall substances
 capable place, troubled make seem possible,
 soule can goe hence, without body heaven, hell, or
 purgatory; ghosts men (and may adde clothes
 appear in) can walk night churches, church-yards, and
 places sepulture. know can answer,
 unlesse will say, walke definitive, circumscriptive, or
 spiritually, temporally: egregious distinctions equally
 applicable difficulty whatsoever.
 



nunc-stans
 
meaning eternity, will endlesse
 succession time; able render reason
 gods will, praeordaining things come, before
 praescience same, efficient cause effect,
 agent action; many bold opinions
 concerning incomprehensible nature god. will teach us,
 eternity standing still present time, nunc-stans
 (as schools call it;) neither they, else understand,
 hic-stans infinite greatnesse place.
 



one body many places, many bodies one place once
 
whereas men divide body thought, numbring parts of
 it, numbring parts, number also parts place
 filled; be, making many parts, wee make also many
 places parts; whereby bee conceived mind of
 man, more, fewer parts, places for: yet will
 us beleeve, almighty power god, one body may at
 one time many places; many bodies one the
 time one place; acknowledgment divine
 power, say, is, not; been, not
 been. small part incongruities are
 forced to, disputing philosophically, stead admiring,
 adoring divine incomprehensible nature; whose attributes
 signifie is, signifie desire honour
 him, best appellations can think on. venture
 reason nature, attributes honour, losing their
 understanding first attempt, fall one inconvenience
 another, without end, without number; manner,
 man ignorant ceremonies court, comming the
 presence greater person used speak to, stumbling
 entrance, save himselfe falling, lets slip cloake;
 recover cloake, lets fall hat; one disorder after
 another, discovers astonishment rusticity.
 



absurdities naturall philosophy, gravity cause heavinesse
 
physiques, is, knowledge subordinate, and
 secundary causes naturall events; render none all, empty
 words. desire know kind bodies sink naturally
 downwards toward earth, others goe naturally it; the
 schools will tell aristotle, bodies sink
 downwards, heavy; heavinesse causes to
 descend: ask mean heavinesse, will define
 bee endeavour goe center earth: the
 cause things sink downward, endeavour below: is
 much say, bodies descend, ascend, doe.
 will tell center earth place rest, and
 conservation heavy things; therefore endeavour there:
 stones, metalls desire, discern place they
 bee at, man does; loved rest, man not; a
 peece glasse lesse safe window, falling the
 street.
 



quantity put body already made
 
know body seems greater (without adding it)
 one time, another; say, seems lesse, condensed;
 greater, rarefied. condensed, rarefied? condensed,
 matter, lesse quantity before;
 rarefied, more. matter, some
 determined quantity; quantity nothing else determination
 matter; say body, say one body greater,
 lesser another, thus, thus much. body made
 without quantity all, afterwards more, lesse put
 it, according intended body more, lesse
 dense.
 



powring soules
 
cause soule man, say, creatur infundendo, and
 creando infunditur: is, "it created powring in," and
 "powred creation."
 



ubiquity apparition
 
cause sense, ubiquity species; is, shews
 apparitions objects; apparitions eye, is
 sight; eare, hearing; palate, tast; nostrill,
 smelling; rest body, feeling.
 



will, cause willing
 
cause will, doe particular action, called
 volitio, assign faculty, say, capacity in
 generall, men have, will sometimes one thing, sometimes another,
 called voluntas; making power cause act: as
 one assign cause good evill acts men, their
 ability doe them.
 



ignorance occult cause
 
many occasions put cause naturall events, own
 ignorance, disguised words: say, fortune is
 cause things contingent; is, things whereof know no
 cause: attribute many effects occult qualities; that
 is, qualities known them; therefore also (as thinke)
 man else. sympathy, antipathy, antiperistasis, specificall
 qualities, like termes, signifie neither agent that
 produceth them, operation produced.
 
metaphysiques, physiques this, vain philosophy,
 never any; needed st. paul give us warning avoid it.
 



one makes things incongruent, another incongruity
 
morall, civill philosophy, hath same, or
 greater absurdities. man doe action injustice, to
 say, action contrary law, god say prime cause of
 law, also prime cause that, actions; no
 cause injustice; inconformity action
 law. vain philosophy. man might well say, one
 man maketh streight line, crooked, another maketh their
 incongruity. philosophy men resolve their
 conclusions, know premises; pretending comprehend,
 incomprehensible; attributes honour make
 attributes nature; distinction made maintain the
 doctrine free-will, is, will man, subject the
 will god.
 



private appetite rule publique good:
 
aristotle, heathen philosophers define good, evill, the
 appetite men; well enough, long consider governed
 every one law: condition men other
 law appetites, can generall rule good, and
 evill actions. common-wealth measure false: the
 appetite private men, law, will appetite of
 state measure. yet doctrine still practised; and
 men judge goodnesse, wickednesse own, mens
 actions, actions common-wealth selfe, own
 passions; man calleth good evill, his
 eyes, without regard publique laws; except onely
 monks, friers, bound vow simple obedience to
 superiour, every subject think bound by
 law nature civill soveraign. private measure of
 good, doctrine, onely vain, also pernicious publique
 state.
 



lawfull marriage unchastity
 
also vain false philosophy, say work marriage is
 repugnant chastity, continence, consequence make them
 morall vices; doe, pretend chastity, continence, for
 ground denying marriage clergy. confesse is
 more, constitution church, requireth holy
 orders continually attend altar, administration the
 eucharist, continuall abstinence women, name of
 continuall chastity, continence, purity. therefore call the
 lawfull use wives, want chastity, continence; make
 marriage sin, least thing impure, unclean, render
 man unfit altar. law made use wives
 incontinence, contrary chastity, marriage vice; if
 thing impure, unclean man consecrated to
 god; much naturall, necessary, daily works which
 men doe, render men unworthy bee priests, more
 unclean.
 
secret foundation prohibition marriage priests, is
 likely laid slightly, upon errours morall
 philosophy; yet upon preference single life, estate of
 matrimony; proceeded wisdome st. paul, perceived
 inconvenient thing was, times of
 persecution preachers gospel, forced fly one
 countrey another, clogged care wife children;
 upon design popes, priests times, make
 clergy, say, sole heirs kingdome god
 world; necessary take use of
 marriage, saviour saith, coming kingdome
 children god shall "neither marry, bee given marriage, but
 shall bee angels heaven;" say, spirituall. seeing
 taken name spirituall, allowed
 (when need) propriety wives, an
 incongruity.
 



government popular, tyranny
 
aristotles civill philosophy, learned, call manner
 common-wealths popular, (such time state
 athens,) tyranny. kings called tyrants; aristocracy
 thirty governours set lacedemonians subdued
 them, thirty tyrants: also call condition people
 democracy, liberty. tyrant originally signified more
 simply, monarch: afterwards parts greece that
 kind government abolished, name began signifie, onely
 thing before, it, hatred popular
 states bare towards it: also name king became odious the
 deposing kings rome, thing naturall men,
 conceive great fault signified attribute, is
 given despight, great enemy. men shall be
 displeased administration democracy,
 aristocracy, seek disgraceful names expresse
 anger in; call readily one anarchy, other
 oligarchy, tyranny few. offendeth people,
 thing, governed, every one them
 himselfe, publique representant, one man, an
 assembly men thinks fit; is, arbitrary government: for
 give evill names superiors; never knowing (till
 perhaps little civill warre) without arbitrary
 government, warre must perpetuall; men, arms,
 words, promises, make force power laws.
 



men, law governs
 
therefore another errour aristotles politiques, in
 wel ordered common-wealth, men govern, laws. what
 man, naturall senses, though can neither write read,
 find governed fears, beleeves can kill
 hurt obeyeth not? beleeves law can hurt him;
 is, words, paper, without hands, swords men? and
 number pernicious errors: induce men, oft
 like governours, adhaere call them
 tyrants, think lawfull raise warre them: yet
 many times cherished pulpit, clergy.
 



laws conscience
 
another errour civill philosophy (which never
 learned aristotle, cicero, heathen,) to
 extend power law, rule actions onely, the
 thoughts, consciences men, examination, inquisition
 hold, notwithstanding conformity speech and
 actions: which, men either punished answering truth
 thoughts, constrained answer untruth fear of
 punishment. true, civill magistrate, intending employ
 minister charge teaching, may enquire him, hee bee
 content preach such, doctrines; case refusall,
 may deny employment: force accuse himselfe of
 opinions, actions law forbidden, the
 law nature; especially them, teach, man shall bee
 damned eternall extream torments, die false opinion
 concerning article christian faith. there, that
 knowing great danger error, naturall care
 himself, compelleth hazard soule upon judgement,
 rather man unconcerned damnation?
 



private interpretation law
 
private man, without authority common-wealth, is
 say, without permission representant thereof, interpret
 law spirit, another error politiques; not
 drawn aristotle, heathen philosophers.
 none deny, power making laws, is
 comprehended also power explaining need. and
 scriptures, places law, made law by
 authority common-wealth, consequently, part the
 civill law?
 
kind also, soveraign restraineth in
 man power common-wealth hath restrained: they
 do, impropriate preaching gospell one certain order
 men, laws left free. state give leave to
 preach, teach; is, forbid not, man can forbid me.
 find selfe amongst idolaters america, shall a
 christian, though orders, think preach jesus christ,
 till received orders rome? preached, shall
 answer doubts, expound scriptures them; is
 shall teach? may say, also administring
 sacraments, necessity shall esteemed sufficient
 mission; true: true also, whatsoever,
 dispensation due necessity, needs no
 dispensation, law forbids it. therefore deny
 functions those, civill soveraigne hath denyed
 them, taking away lawfull liberty, contrary the
 doctrine civill government.
 



language schoole-divines
 
examples vain philosophy, brought religion doctors
 schoole-divinity, might produced; men may please
 observe themselves. shall onely adde this, the
 writings schoole-divines, nothing else part, but
 insignificant traines strange barbarous words, words otherwise
 used, common use latine tongue; pose
 cicero, varro, grammarians ancient rome. any
 man see proved, let (as said before) see whether
 can translate schoole-divine modern tongues, as
 french, english, copious language: cannot
 made intelligible, intelligible latine.
 insignificancy language, though note false
 philosophy; yet hath quality, onely hide truth, also
 make men think it, desist search.
 



errors tradition
 
lastly, errors brought false, uncertain history, what
 legend fictitious miracles, lives saints;
 histories apparitions, ghosts, alledged the
 doctors romane church, make good doctrines hell, and
 purgatory, power exorcisme, doctrines no
 warrant, neither reason, scripture; also traditions
 call unwritten word god; old wives fables?
 whereof, though find dispersed somewhat writings the
 ancient fathers; yet fathers men, might easily
 beleeve false reports; producing opinions testimony
 truth beleeved, hath force that
 (according counsell st. john 1 epist. chap. 4. verse 1.)
 examine spirits, things concern power romane
 church, (the abuse whereof either suspected not, benefit
 it,) discredit testimony, respect rash beleef of
 reports; sincere men, without great knowledge naturall
 causes, (such fathers were) commonly subject to: for
 naturally, best men least suspicious fraudulent purposes.
 gregory pope, s. bernard somewhat apparitions ghosts,
 said purgatory; beda: where, i
 beleeve, report others. they, other, relate
 stories knowledge, shall thereby confirm
 vain reports; discover infirmity, fraud.
 



suppression reason
 
introduction false, may joyn also suppression true
 philosophy, men, neither lawfull authority, sufficient
 study, competent judges truth. navigations make
 manifest, men learned humane sciences, now acknowledge there
 antipodes: every day appeareth more, years, and
 dayes determined motions earth. neverthelesse, men that
 writings supposed doctrine, occasion to
 lay open reasons for, it, punished it
 authority ecclesiasticall. reason it? it
 opinions contrary true religion? be,
 true. let therefore truth first examined competent
 judges, confuted pretend know contrary. is
 contrary religion established? let be
 silenced laws those, teachers subject;
 is, laws civill: disobedience may lawfully punished
 them, laws teach even true philosophy. because
 tend disorder government, countenancing rebellion, or
 sedition? let silenced, teachers punished vertue
 power care publique quiet committed; which
 authority civill. whatsoever power ecclesiastiques take upon
 (in place subject state) their
 right, though call gods right, usurpation.
 



chapter xlvii. benefit proceedeth darknesse, and
 accreweth
 



receiveth benefit fact, presumed author
 
cicero maketh honorable mention one cassii, severe judge
 amongst romans, custome had, criminal causes, (when the
 testimony witnesses sufficient,) ask accusers,
 cui bono; say, profit, honor, contentment, the
 accused obtained, expected fact. amongst praesumptions,
 none evidently declareth author, doth the
 benefit action. rule intend place to
 examine, may be, possessed people long this
 part christendome, doctrines, contrary peaceable
 societies mankind.
 



church militant kingdome god, first taught by
 church rome
 
first, error, present church now militant earth,
 kingdome god, (that is, kingdome glory, land of
 promise; kingdome grace, promise the
 land,) annexed worldly benefits, first, pastors,
 teachers church, entitled thereby, gods publique
 ministers, right governing church; consequently (because
 church, common-wealth persons) rectors, and
 governours common-wealth. title is, pope
 prevailed subjects christian princes, beleeve, that
 disobey him, disobey christ himselfe; differences
 princes, (charmed word power spirituall,)
 abandon lawfull soveraigns; effect universall
 monarchy christendome. though first invested in
 right supreme teachers christian doctrine, by, and
 christian emperors, within limits romane empire (as is
 acknowledged themselves) title pontifex maximus, an
 officer subject civill state; yet empire divided,
 dissolved, hard obtrude upon people already
 subject them, another title, namely, right st. peter; not
 onely save entire pretended power; also extend same
 christian provinces, though united empire
 rome. benefit universall monarchy, (considering desire
 men bear rule) sufficient presumption, popes that
 pretended it, long time enjoyed it, authors of
 doctrine, obtained; namely, church now
 earth, kingdome christ. granted, must be
 understood, christ hath lieutenant amongst us, are
 told commandements.
 
certain churches renounced universall power the
 pope, one expect reason, civill soveraigns all
 churches, recovered much it, (before had
 unadvisedly let goe) right, hands.
 england effect; saving they, kings
 administred government religion, maintaining imployment
 gods right, seemed usurp, supremacy, yet an
 independency civill power: seemed usurp it, in
 much acknowledged right king, deprive the
 exercise functions pleasure.
 



maintained also presbytery
 
places presbytery took office, though many
 doctrines church rome forbidden taught; yet
 doctrine, kingdome christ already come, it
 began resurrection saviour, still retained. cui
 bono? profit expect it? popes
 expected: soveraign power people. for
 men excommunicate lawful king, keep places
 gods publique service kingdom? force resist
 him, force endeavoureth correct them? it,
 without authority civill soveraign, excommunicate any
 person, take lawfull liberty, is, usurpe
 unlawfull power brethren? authors therefore this
 darknesse religion, romane, presbyterian clergy.
 



infallibility
 
head, referre also doctrines, serve to
 keep possession spirituall soveraignty gotten.
 first, pope publique capacity erre. who
 there, beleeving true, will readily obey in
 whatsoever commands?
 



subjection bishops
 
secondly, bishops, common-wealth soever, have
 right, neither immediately god, mediately their
 civill soveraigns, pope, doctrine, there
 comes every christian common-wealth many potent men, (for so
 bishops,) dependance pope, owe obedience
 him, though forraign prince; means able, (as
 hath done many times) raise civill war state
 submits self governed according pleasure and
 interest.
 



exemptions clergy
 
thirdly, exemption these, priests, all
 monkes, fryers, power civill laws. this
 means, great part every common-wealth, enjoy the
 benefit laws, protected power civill state,
 neverthelesse pay part publique expence; are
 lyable penalties, subjects, due crimes; and
 consequently, stand fear man, pope; adhere to
 onely, uphold universall monarchy.
 



names sacerdotes, sacrifices
 
fourthly, giving priests (which new
 testament presbyters, is, elders) name sacerdotes, that
 is, sacrificers, title civill soveraign, his
 publique ministers, amongst jews, whilest god king. also,
 making lords supper sacrifice, serveth make people
 beleeve pope hath power christian, moses
 aaron jews; say, power, civill and
 ecclesiasticall, high priest had.
 



sacramentation marriage
 
fiftly, teaching matrimony sacrament, giveth the
 clergy judging lawfulnesse marriages; thereby, what
 children legitimate; consequently, right succession to
 haereditary kingdomes.
 



single life priests
 
sixtly, deniall marriage priests, serveth assure power
 pope kings. king priest, marry, and
 transmit kingdome posterity; priest the
 pope pretendeth authority ecclesiasticall him, his
 people.
 



auricular confession
 
seventhly, auricular confession, obtain, assurance of
 power, better intelligence designs princes, great
 persons civill state, can designs the
 state ecclesiasticall.
 



canonization saints, declaring martyrs
 
eighthly, canonization saints, declaring martyrs,
 assure power, induce simple men an
 obstinacy laws commands civill soveraigns even
 death, popes excommunication, declared heretiques
 enemies church; is, (as interpret it,) pope.
 



transubstantiation, penance, absolution
 
ninthly, assure same, power ascribe every
 priest, making christ; power ordaining pennance; of
 remitting, retaining sins.
 



purgatory, indulgences, externall works
 
tenthly, doctrine purgatory, justification externall
 works, indulgences, clergy enriched.
 



daemonology exorcism
 
eleventhly, daemonology, use exorcisme, other
 things appertaining thereto, keep (or thinke keep) people
 awe power.
 



school-divinity
 
lastly, metaphysiques, ethiques, politiques aristotle, the
 frivolous distinctions, barbarous terms, obscure language the
 schoolmen, taught universities, (which erected and
 regulated popes authority,) serve keep errors
 detected, make men mistake ignis fatuus vain
 philosophy, light gospell.
 



authors spirituall darknesse, be
 
these, sufficed not, might added dark
 doctrines, profit whereof redoundeth manifestly, setting up
 unlawfull power lawfull soveraigns christian people;
 sustaining same, set up; worldly
 riches, honour, authority sustain it. therefore by
 aforesaid rule, cui bono, may justly pronounce authors
 spirituall darknesse, pope, roman clergy, and
 besides endeavour settle mindes men this
 erroneous doctrine, church now earth, kingdome of
 god mentioned old new testament.
 
emperours, christian soveraigns, whose
 government errours, like encroachments ecclesiastiques
 upon office, first crept in, disturbance their
 possessions, tranquillity subjects, though they
 suffered want foresight sequel, insight
 designs teachers, may neverthelesse bee esteemed
 accessories own, publique dammage; without
 authority first seditious doctrine been
 publiquely preached. say might hindred the
 beginning: people possessed spirituall
 men, humane remedy applyed, man could
 invent: remedies god provide, never faileth
 good time destroy machinations men the
 truth, wee attend good pleasure, suffereth many times
 prosperity enemies, together ambition, grow
 height, violence thereof openeth eyes, the
 warinesse predecessours sealed up, makes men
 much grasping let goe all, peters net broken, the
 struggling great multitude fishes; whereas impatience
 those, strive resist encroachment, subjects
 eyes opened, encrease power resisted. doe not
 therefore blame emperour frederick holding stirrop our
 countryman pope adrian; disposition subjects
 then, hee doe it, hee likely succeeded in
 empire: blame those, beginning, power
 entire, suffering doctrines forged universities
 dominions, holden stirrop succeeding
 popes, whilest mounted thrones christian
 soveraigns, ride, tire, them, people, their
 pleasure.
 
inventions men woven, also ravelled out;
 way same, order inverted: web begins the
 first elements power, wisdom, humility, sincerity, and
 vertues apostles, people converted, obeyed, out
 reverence, obligation: consciences free, their
 words actions subject none civill power. afterwards the
 presbyters (as flocks christ encreased) assembling consider
 teach, thereby obliging teach nothing
 decrees assemblies, made thought the
 people thereby obliged follow doctrine, when
 refused, refused keep company, (that called
 excommunication,) infidels, disobedient: and
 first knot upon liberty. number presbyters
 encreasing, presbyters chief city province, got themselves
 authority parochiall presbyters, appropriated to
 names bishops: second knot christian
 liberty. lastly, bishop rome, regard imperiall city,
 took upon authority (partly wills emperours
 themselves, title pontifex maximus, last the
 emperours grown weak, priviledges st. peter) all
 bishops empire: third last knot, the
 whole synthesis construction pontificall power.
 
therefore analysis, resolution way; but
 beginning knot last tyed; wee may see the
 dissolution praeterpoliticall church government england.
 
first, power popes dissolved totally queen elizabeth;
 bishops, exercised functions right the
 pope, afterwards exercise right queen her
 successours; though retaining phrase jure divino, were
 thought demand immediate right god: untyed the
 first knot. this, presbyterians lately england obtained the
 putting episcopacy: second knot dissolved:
 almost time, power taken also the
 presbyterians: reduced independency the
 primitive christians follow paul, cephas, apollos, every man
 liketh best: which, without contention, without
 measuring doctrine christ, affection person his
 minister, (the fault apostle reprehended corinthians,)
 perhaps best: first, power the
 consciences men, word selfe, working faith every
 one, alwayes according purpose plant water,
 god himself, giveth increase: secondly, it
 unreasonable them, teach danger every little
 errour, require man endued reason own, follow the
 reason man, voices many men; which
 little better, venture salvation crosse pile. nor
 teachers displeased losse antient
 authority: none know better they, power is
 preserved vertues acquired; to
 say, wisdome, humility, clearnesse doctrine, sincerity of
 conversation; suppression naturall sciences, and
 morality naturall reason; obscure language; by
 arrogating knowledge make appear; by
 pious frauds; faults, pastors gods church
 faults, also scandalls, apt make men stumble one
 time upon suppression authority.
 



comparison papacy kingdome fayries
 
doctrine, "that church now militant, kingdome
 god spoken old new testament," received in
 world; ambition, canvasing offices belong
 thereunto, especially great office christs
 lieutenant, pompe obtained therein principal
 publique charges, became degrees evident, lost the
 inward reverence due pastorall function: much wisest
 men, power civill state, needed nothing but
 authority princes, deny obedience. for,
 time bishop rome gotten acknowledged for
 bishop universall, pretence succession st. peter, whole
 hierarchy, kingdome darknesse, may compared unfitly to
 kingdome fairies; is, old wives fables england,
 concerning ghosts spirits, feats play night. and
 man consider originall great ecclesiasticall dominion,
 will easily perceive, papacy, other, ghost of
 deceased romane empire, sitting crowned upon grave thereof: for
 papacy start sudden ruines heathen
 power.
 
language also, use, churches, their
 publique acts, latine, commonly used nation
 now world, ghost old romane language.
 
fairies nation soever converse, one universall
 king, poets call king oberon; scripture calls
 beelzebub, prince daemons. ecclesiastiques likewise, whose
 dominions soever found, acknowledge one universall king, the
 pope.
 
ecclesiastiques spirituall men, ghostly fathers. the
 fairies spirits, ghosts. fairies ghosts inhabite darknesse,
 solitudes, graves. ecclesiastiques walke obscurity of
 doctrine, monasteries, churches, churchyards.
 
ecclesiastiques cathedral churches; which, towne
 soever erected, vertue holy water, certain charmes
 called exorcismes, power make townes, cities, is
 say, seats empire. fairies also enchanted castles,
 certain gigantique ghosts, domineer regions round
 them.
 
fairies seized on; brought answer hurt
 do. also ecclesiastiques vanish away tribunals of
 civill justice.
 
ecclesiastiques take young men, use reason, certain
 charms compounded metaphysiques, miracles, traditions, and
 abused scripture, whereby good nothing else, execute
 command them. fairies likewise said take young
 children cradles, change naturall fools,
 common people therefore call elves, apt mischief.
 
shop, operatory fairies make enchantment, old
 wives determined. operatories clergy, well
 enough known universities, received discipline from
 authority pontificall.
 
fairies displeased body, said to
 send elves, pinch them. ecclesiastiques, are
 displeased civill state, make also elves, is,
 superstitious, enchanted subjects, pinch princes, preaching
 sedition; one prince enchanted promises, pinch another.
 
fairies marry not; amongst incubi, have
 copulation flesh bloud. priests also marry not.
 
ecclesiastiques take cream land, donations ignorant
 men, stand aw them, tythes: also fable
 fairies, enter dairies, feast upon cream,
 skim milk.
 
kind money currant kingdome fairies, not
 recorded story. ecclesiastiques receipts accept
 money doe; though make payment,
 canonizations, indulgences, masses.
 
this, like resemblances papacy, kingdome
 fairies, may added this, fairies existence,
 fancies ignorant people, rising traditions old
 wives, old poets: spirituall power pope (without the
 bounds civill dominion) consisteth onely fear that
 seduced people stand in, excommunication; upon hearing false
 miracles, false traditions, false interpretations scripture.
 
therefore difficult matter, henry 8. his
 exorcisme; qu. elizabeth hers, cast out. who
 knows spirit rome, now gone out, walking missions
 dry places china, japan, indies, yeeld him
 little fruit, may return, rather assembly spirits worse
 he, enter, inhabite clean swept house, make end
 thereof worse beginning? romane clergy onely,
 pretends kingdome god world, thereby to
 power therein, distinct civill state. and
 designe say, concerning doctrine the
 politiques. reviewed, shall willingly expose to
 censure countrey.
 



review, conclusion
 

contrariety naturall faculties mind, one
 another, also one passion another, reference
 conversation, argument taken, inferre an
 impossibility one man sufficiently disposed all
 sorts civill duty. severity judgment, say, makes men
 censorious, unapt pardon errours infirmities other
 men: side, celerity fancy, makes thoughts lesse
 steddy necessary, discern exactly right wrong.
 again, deliberations, pleadings, faculty solid
 reasoning, necessary: without it, resolutions men are
 rash, sentences unjust: yet powerfull
 eloquence, procureth attention consent, effect reason
 will little. contrary faculties; former being
 grounded upon principles truth; upon opinions already
 received, true, false; upon passions interests men,
 different, mutable.
 
amongst passions, courage, (by mean contempt of
 wounds, violent death) enclineth men private revenges, and
 sometimes endeavour unsetling publique peace; and
 timorousnesse, many times disposeth desertion publique
 defence. say stand together person.
 
consider contrariety mens opinions, manners in
 generall, say, impossible entertain constant civill
 amity those, businesse world constrains

 perpetuall contention honor, riches, authority.
 
answer, indeed great difficulties, not
 impossibilities: education, discipline, may bee, and
 sometimes reconciled. judgment, fancy may place the
 man; turnes; end aimeth requireth. the
 israelites egypt, sometimes fastened labour making
 bricks, times ranging abroad gather straw: also may
 judgment sometimes fixed upon one certain consideration, and
 fancy another time wandring world. also reason,
 eloquence, (though perhaps naturall sciences, yet the
 morall) may stand well together. wheresoever place for
 adorning preferring errour, much place adorning
 preferring truth, adorn. any
 repugnancy fearing laws, fearing publique enemy;
 abstaining injury, pardoning others. is
 therefore inconsistence humane nature, civill duties,
 think. known cleernesse judgment, largenesse of
 fancy; strength reason, gracefull elocution; courage the
 warre, fear laws, eminently one man; that
 noble honored friend mr. sidney godolphin; hating no
 man, hated any, unfortunately slain beginning the
 late civill warre, publique quarrel, indiscerned, an
 undiscerning hand.
 
laws nature, declared 15. chapter, this
 added, "that every man bound nature, much lieth, to
 protect warre, authority, protected in
 time peace." pretendeth right nature preserve
 owne body, pretend right nature destroy him, whose
 strength preserved: manifest contradiction himselfe.
 though law may bee drawn consequence, those
 already mentioned; yet times require it
 inculcated, remembred.
 
find divers english books lately printed, the
 civill warres yet sufficiently taught men, point of
 time is, subject becomes obliged conquerour; what
 conquest; comes about, obliges men obey his
 laws: therefore farther satisfaction men therein, say, the
 point time, wherein man becomes subject conquerour, that
 point, wherein liberty submit him, consenteth, either by
 expresse words, sufficient sign, subject. it
 man hath liberty submit, showed the
 end 21. chapter; namely, hath obligation to
 former soveraign ordinary subject, then, when
 means life within guards garrisons enemy;
 then, hath longer protection him, is
 protected adverse party contribution. seeing
 therefore contribution every where, thing inevitable,
 (notwithstanding assistance enemy,) esteemed lawfull;
 totall submission, assistance enemy, cannot
 esteemed unlawfull. besides, man consider submit,
 assist enemy part estates, whereas that
 refuse, assist whole, reason call their
 submission, composition assistance; rather detriment the
 enemy. man, besides obligation subject, hath taken
 upon new obligation souldier, hath liberty
 submit new power, long old one keeps field, and
 giveth means subsistence, either armies, garrisons:
 case, complain want protection, means to
 live souldier: also failes, souldier also may seek
 protection wheresoever hope it; may lawfully
 submit new master. much time may
 lawfully, hee will. therefore doe it, undoubtedly
 bound true subject: contract lawfully made, cannot
 lawfully broken.
 
also man may understand, is, men may said to
 conquered; nature conquest, right a
 conquerour consisteth: submission implyeth all.
 conquest, victory self; acquisition victory,
 right, persons men. therefore slain, is
 overcome, conquered; taken, put prison, or
 chaines, conquered, though overcome; still enemy,
 may save hee can: upon promise obedience,
 hath life liberty allowed him, conquered, subject;
 before. romanes used say, generall had
 pacified province, say, english, conquered it; and
 countrey pacified victory, people it
 promised imperata facere, is, doe romane people
 commanded them: conquered. promise may either

 example, man hath called make expresse
 promise, (because one whose power perhaps considerable;)
 yet live protection openly, hee understood to
 submit himselfe government: live secretly, is
 lyable thing may bee done spie, enemy state.
 say not, hee injustice, (for acts open hostility bear not
 name); may justly put death. likewise, man,
 country conquered, it, conquered, nor
 subject: return, submit government, bound
 obey it. conquest (to define it) acquiring the
 right soveraignty victory. right, acquired, the
 peoples submission, contract victor, promising
 obedience, life liberty.
 
29th chapter set one causes the
 dissolutions common-wealths, imperfect generation, consisting
 want absolute arbitrary legislative power; want
 whereof, civill soveraign fain handle sword justice
 unconstantly, hot hold: one reason
 whereof (which mentioned) this, will all
 justifie war, power first gotten,
 whereon (as think) right dependeth, the
 possession. if, example, right kings england did
 depend goodnesse cause william conquerour, upon
 lineall, directest descent him; means, there
 perhaps tie subjects obedience soveraign
 day world: wherein whilest needlessely think to
 justifie themselves, justifie successefull rebellions that
 ambition shall time raise them, successors.
 therefore put one effectuall seeds death
 state, conquerours require onely submission of
 mens actions future, also approbation all
 actions past; scarce common-wealth world,
 whose beginnings can conscience justified.
 
name tyranny, signifieth nothing more, lesse,
 name soveraignty, one, many men, saving that
 use former word, understood bee angry them
 call tyrants; think toleration professed hatred of
 tyranny, toleration hatred common-wealth general, and
 another evill seed, differing much former. the
 justification cause conqueror, reproach cause
 conquered, part necessary: neither them
 necessary obligation conquered. thus much have
 thought fit say upon review first second part this
 discourse.
 
35th chapter, sufficiently declared scripture,
 common-wealth jewes, god himselfe made the
 soveraign, pact people; therefore called his
 peculiar people, distinguish rest world, over
 god reigned consent, power: that
 kingdome moses gods lieutenant earth; he
 told laws god appointed doe execution; especially
 capitall punishments; thinking matter necessary
 consideration, find since. wee know generally all
 common-wealths, execution corporeall punishments, either put
 upon guards, souldiers soveraign power; given
 those, want means, contempt honour, hardnesse of
 heart, concurred, make sue office. amongst the
 israelites positive law god soveraign, that
 convicted capitall crime, stoned death the
 people; witnesses cast first stone, after
 witnesses, rest people. law designed
 executioners; one throw a
 stone conviction sentence, congregation
 judge. witnesses neverthelesse heard they
 proceeded execution, unlesse fact committed presence
 congregation self, sight lawfull judges; for
 needed witnesses judges themselves.
 neverthelesse, manner proceeding throughly understood,
 hath given occasion dangerous opinion, man may kill
 another, cases, right zeal; executions done
 upon offenders kingdome god old time, proceeded from
 soveraign command, authority private zeal: which, if
 consider texts seem favour it, quite contrary.
 
first, levites fell upon people, made and
 worshipped golden calfe, slew three thousand them; by
 commandement moses, mouth god; manifest, exod.
 32.27. woman israel blasphemed god, they
 heard it, kill him, brought moses, who

 appears, levit. 25.11, 12. again, (numbers 25.6, 7.) phinehas

 crime committed sight assembly; needed
 witnesse; law known, heir apparent the

 sometimes necessary safety [of] common-wealth; sudden

 accuser cause put death, cast first stone at

 like manner father hath rebellious son, law (deut. 21.

 oftentimes conjunction ignorance passion, against

36th chapter said, declared what
 manner god spake supernaturally moses: spake him
 sometimes dreams visions, supernaturall voice, as
 prophets: manner spake unto the
 mercy-seat, expressely set (numbers 7.89.) words,
 "from time forward, moses entred tabernacle the
 congregation speak god, heard voice spake unto him

 evident themselves, consonant scope whole

 writing, publique discourse, eminent actions,
 already engaged maintaining contrary opinions,
 will bee easily satisfied. cases, naturall
 men, one time, proceed reading, to
 lose attention, search objections read
