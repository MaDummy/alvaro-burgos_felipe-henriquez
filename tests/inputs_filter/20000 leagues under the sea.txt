 shifting reef
 

year 1866 signalised remarkable incident, mysterious and
 puzzling phenomenon, doubtless one yet forgotten. to
 mention rumours agitated maritime population excited the
 public mind, even interior continents, seafaring men were
 particularly excited. merchants, common sailors, captains vessels,
 skippers, europe america, naval officers countries,
 governments several states two continents, were
 deeply interested matter.
 
time past, vessels met “an enormous thing,” long
 object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, infinitely
 larger rapid movements whale.
 
facts relating apparition (entered various log-books)
 agreed respects shape object creature in
 question, untiring rapidity movements, surprising power
 locomotion, peculiar life seemed endowed. if
 cetacean, surpassed size hitherto classified
 science. taking consideration mean observations made at
 divers times,—rejecting timid estimate assigned to
 object length two hundred feet, equally exaggerated
 opinions set mile width three length,—we
 might fairly conclude mysterious surpassed greatly all
 dimensions admitted ichthyologists day, existed at
 all. _did_ exist undeniable fact; and, that
 tendency disposes human mind favour marvellous, we
 can understand excitement produced entire world this
 supernatural apparition. classing list fables, the
 idea question.
 
20th july, 1866, steamer _governor higginson_, the
 calcutta burnach steam navigation company, met moving mass
 five miles east coast australia. captain baker thought at
 first presence unknown sandbank; even
 prepared determine exact position, two columns water,
 projected inexplicable object, shot hissing noise a
 hundred fifty feet air. now, unless sandbank had
 submitted intermittent eruption geyser, _governor
 higginson_ neither less aquatic mammal,
 unknown till then, threw blow-holes columns water
 mixed air vapour.
 
similar facts observed 23rd july year, in
 pacific ocean, _columbus_, west india pacific
 steam navigation company. extraordinary cetaceous creature
 transport one place another surprising
 velocity; as, interval three days, _governor higginson_
 _columbus_ observed two different points the
 chart, separated distance seven hundred nautical
 leagues.
 
fifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, _helvetia_, of
 compagnie-nationale, _shannon_, royal mail steamship
 company, sailing windward portion atlantic lying
 united states europe, respectively signalled the
 monster 42° 15′ n. lat. 60° 35′ w. long. these
 simultaneous observations thought justified in
 estimating minimum length mammal three hundred
 fifty feet, _shannon_ _helvetia_ smaller
 dimensions it, though measured three hundred feet all.
 
now largest whales, frequent parts sea
 round aleutian, kulammak, umgullich islands, never
 exceeded length sixty yards, attain that.
 
reports arriving one other, fresh observations
 made board transatlantic ship _pereire_, collision which
 occurred _etna_ inman line monster, a

 _normandie_, accurate survey made staff commodore
 fitz-james board _lord clyde_, greatly influenced public
 opinion. light-thinking people jested upon phenomenon, grave
 practical countries, england, america, germany, treated the
 matter seriously.
 
every place great resort monster fashion. sang
 cafés, ridiculed papers, represented on
 stage. kinds stories circulated regarding it. there
 appeared papers caricatures every gigantic imaginary
 creature, white whale, terrible “moby dick” hyperborean
 regions, immense kraken whose tentacles entangle ship of
 five hundred tons, hurry abyss ocean. the
 legends ancient times even resuscitated, opinions of
 aristotle pliny revived, admitted existence these
 monsters, well norwegian tales bishop pontoppidan, the
 accounts paul heggede, and, last all, reports mr.
 harrington (whose good faith one suspect), affirmed that,
 board _castillan_, 1857, seen enormous
 serpent, never time frequented seas but
 ancient “_constitutionnel_.”
 
burst forth interminable controversy credulous and
 incredulous societies savants scientific
 journals. “the question monster” inflamed minds. editors of
 scientific journals, quarrelling believers supernatural,
 spilled seas ink memorable campaign, even drawing
 blood; for, sea-serpent came direct personalities.
 
six months war waged various fortune leading
 articles geographical institution brazil, royal academy
 science berlin, british association, smithsonian
 institution washington, discussions “indian
 archipelago,” cosmos abbé moigno, mittheilungen of
 petermann, scientific chronicles great journals france
 countries. cheaper journals replied keenly with
 inexhaustible zest. satirical writers parodied remark of
 linnæus, quoted adversaries monster, maintaining “that
 nature make fools,” adjured contemporaries to
 give lie nature, admitting existence krakens,
 sea-serpents, “moby dicks,” lucubrations delirious
 sailors. length article well-known satirical journal a
 favourite contributor, chief staff, settled monster,
 like hippolytus, giving death-blow amidst universal burst of
 laughter. wit conquered science.
 
first months year 1867 question seemed buried,
 never revive, new facts brought public. was
 longer scientific problem solved, real danger
 seriously avoided. question took quite another shape. the
 monster became small island, rock, reef, reef indefinite
 shifting proportions.
 
5th march, 1867, _moravian_, montreal ocean

fact, grave itself, might perhaps forgotten like
 many others if, three weeks after, re-enacted under
 similar circumstances. but, thanks nationality victim of
 shock, thanks reputation company vessel

13th april, 1867, beautiful, breeze

period events took place, just returned a
 scientific research disagreeable territory nebraska, the
 united states. virtue office assistant professor the
 museum natural history paris, french government attached

 york towards end march, laden precious collection. my
 departure france fixed first days may. meanwhile, i
 occupying classifying mineralogical, botanical, and
 zoological riches, accident happened _scotia_.
 
perfectly subject question day.
 otherwise? read re-read american and
 european papers without nearer conclusion. mystery
 puzzled me. impossibility forming opinion, jumped
 one extreme other. really something could
 doubted, incredulous invited put finger on
 wound _scotia_.
 
arrival new york question height. the
 hypothesis floating island, unapproachable sandbank,
 supported minds little competent form judgment, abandoned.
 and, indeed, unless shoal machine stomach, could
 change position astonishing rapidity?
 
cause, idea floating hull enormous wreck
 given up.
 
remained two possible solutions question, which
 created two distinct parties: one side, monster
 colossal strength; other, submarine
 vessel enormous motive power.
 
last hypothesis, plausible was, stand against
 inquiries made worlds. private gentleman have
 machine command likely. where, when, was
 built? construction kept secret?
 certainly government might possess destructive machine. in
 disastrous times, ingenuity man multiplied the
 power weapons war, possible that, without knowledge of
 others, state might try work formidable engine. the
 chassepots came torpedoes, torpedoes submarine rams,
 then—the reaction. least, hope so.
 
hypothesis war machine fell declaration of
 governments. public interest question, transatlantic
 communications suffered, veracity doubted. but, how
 admit construction submarine boat escaped the
 public eye? private gentleman keep secret such
 circumstances difficult, state whose every act
 persistently watched powerful rivals, certainly impossible.
 
inquiries made england, france, russia, prussia, spain, italy,
 america, even turkey, hypothesis submarine monitor was
 definitely rejected.
 
upon arrival new york several persons honour of
 consulting phenomenon question. published france

 gained special reputation rather obscure branch of
 natural history. advice asked. long deny the
 reality fact, confined decided negative. soon,
 finding driven corner, obliged explain myself
 categorically. even “the honourable pierre aronnax, professor in
 museum paris,” called upon _new york herald_ to
 express definite opinion sort. something. spoke, for
 want power hold tongue. discussed question its
 forms, politically scientifically; give extract from
 carefully-studied article published number 30th
 april. ran follows:—
 
“after examining one one different hypotheses, rejecting all
 suggestions, becomes necessary admit existence a
 marine animal enormous power.
 
“the great depths ocean entirely unknown us. soundings

 conformable reason admit existence fishes, or
 cetaceans kinds, even new species, organisation

 accident sort, either fatastical capricious, brought at
 long intervals upper level ocean.
 
“if, contrary, _do_ know living kinds, must
 necessarily seek animal question amongst marine beings
 already classed; and, case, disposed admit the
 existence gigantic narwhal.
 
“the common narwhal, unicorn sea, often attains length of
 sixty feet. increase size fivefold tenfold, give strength
 proportionate size, lengthen destructive weapons, you
 obtain animal required. will proportions determined by
 officers _shannon_, instrument required the
 perforation _scotia_, power necessary pierce hull

“indeed, narwhal armed sort ivory sword, halberd,

 bodies whales, unicorn always attacks success.
 others drawn out, without trouble, bottoms of
 ships, pierced through, gimlet pierces

“very well! suppose weapon six times stronger animal

 obtain shock capable producing catastrophe required.
 information, therefore, shall maintain a
 sea-unicorn colossal dimensions, armed halberd, with
 real spur, armoured frigates, ‘rams’ war, whose
 massiveness motive power possess time. thus
 may puzzling phenomenon explained, unless something
 one ever conjectured, seen, perceived, or
 experienced; just within bounds possibility.”
 
last words cowardly part; but, certain point,
 wished shelter dignity professor, give much
 cause laughter americans, laugh well laugh.
 
reserved way escape. effect, however, admitted
 existence “monster.” article warmly discussed, which
 procured high reputation. rallied round certain number of
 partisans. solution proposed gave, least, full liberty the
 imagination. human mind delights grand conceptions of
 supernatural beings. precisely best vehicle, the
 medium giants (against terrestrial
 animals, elephants rhinoceroses, nothing) can be

industrial commercial papers treated question chiefly from
 point view. _shipping mercantile gazette_, _lloyd’s

thus _abraham lincoln_ wanted means destruction; and,
 better still, board ned land, prince of
 harpooners.
 
ned land canadian, uncommon quickness hand, who
 knew equal dangerous occupation. skill, coolness, audacity,
 cunning possessed superior degree, must cunning
 whale singularly “cute” cachalot escape stroke his
 harpoon.
 
ned land forty years age; tall man (more six
 feet high), strongly built, grave taciturn, occasionally violent,
 passionate contradicted. person attracted attention,
 boldness look, gave singular
 expression face.
 
calls canadian calls french; and, little
 communicative ned land was, must admit took certain
 liking me. nationality drew me, doubt. an
 opportunity talk, hear, old language of
 rabelais, still use canadian provinces. the
 harpooner’s family originally quebec, already tribe

little little, ned land acquired taste chatting, loved
 hear recital adventures polar seas. related his
 fishing, combats, natural poetry expression; his
 recital took form epic poem, seemed listening to
 canadian homer singing iliad regions north.
 
portraying hardy companion really knew him. old
 friends now, united unchangeable friendship born and
 cemented amidst extreme dangers. ah, brave ned! ask to
 live hundred years longer, may time dwell the
 longer memory.
 
now, ned land’s opinion upon question marine

 even avoided subject, one day thought duty press

seated poop, ned land chatting one thing and
 another looked mysterious sea, whose great depths up

 conversation giant unicorn, examined various chances

 speak without saying much himself, pressed closely.
 
“well, ned,” said i, “is possible convinced the
 existence cetacean following? any
 particular reason incredulous?”
 
harpooner looked fixedly moments answering,
 struck broad forehead hand (a habit his), to
 collect himself, said last, “perhaps have, mr. aronnax.”
 
“but, ned, you, whaler profession, familiarised great
 marine mammalia—you, whose imagination might easily accept the
 hypothesis enormous cetaceans, _you_ last doubt
 circumstances!”
 
“that just deceives you, professor,” replied ned. “that the
 vulgar believe extraordinary comets traversing space, in
 existence antediluvian monsters heart globe, may
 well be; neither astronomer geologist believes such
 chimeras. whaler followed many cetacean, harpooned a
 great number, killed several; but, however strong well-armed
 may been, neither tails weapons have
 able even scratch iron plates steamer.”
 
“but, ned, tell ships teeth narwhal have
 pierced through.”
 
“wooden ships—that possible,” replied canadian, “but have
 never seen done; and, proof, deny whales,
 cetaceans, sea-unicorns ever produce effect describe.”
 
“well, ned, repeat conviction resting logic of
 facts. believe existence mammal power fully organised,
 belonging branch vertebrata, like whales, cachalots,
 dolphins, furnished horn defence great
 penetrating power.”
 
“hum!” said harpooner, shaking head air man who
 convinced.
 
“notice one thing, worthy canadian,” resumed. “if animal
 existence, inhabits depths ocean, it
 frequents strata lying miles surface water, it
 must necessarily possess organisation strength would
 defy comparison.”
 
“and powerful organisation?” demanded ned.
 
“because requires incalculable strength keep one’s self these
 strata resist pressure. listen me. let us admit the
 pressure atmosphere represented weight column of
 water thirty-two feet high. reality column water be
 shorter, speaking water, density is

 many times thirty-two feet water you, many
 times body bear pressure equal atmosphere,

 follows, then, 320 feet pressure = 10 atmospheres,
 100 atmospheres 3200 feet, 1000 atmospheres 32,000
 feet, is, 6 miles; equivalent saying you
 attain depth ocean, square three-eighths an

 brave ned, know many square inches carry the
 surface body?”
 
“i idea, mr. aronnax.”
 
“about 6500; and, reality atmospheric pressure 15
 lbs. square inch, 6500 square inches bear moment a

“without perceiving it?”
 
“without perceiving it. crushed a

 thing.”
 
“yes, understand,” replied ned, becoming attentive; “because the
 water surrounds me, penetrate.”
 
“precisely, ned: 32 feet beneath surface you
 undergo pressure 97,500 lbs.; 320 feet, ten times that
 pressure; 3200 feet, hundred times pressure; lastly, at
 32,000 feet, thousand times pressure 97,500,000

“the devil!” exclaimed ned.
 
“very well, worthy harpooner, vertebrate, several hundred
 yards long, large proportion, can maintain such
 depths—of whose surface represented millions square
 inches, tens millions pounds, must estimate the

“why!” exclaimed ned land, “they must made iron plates eight
 inches thick, like armoured frigates.”
 
“as say, ned. think destruction mass cause,
 hurled speed express train hull a

“yes—certainly—perhaps,” replied canadian, shaken figures,
 yet willing give in.
 
“well, convinced you?”
 
“you convinced one thing, sir, that, such
 animals exist bottom seas, must necessarily as
 strong say.”
 
“but exist, mine obstinate harpooner, explain the

chapter v
 venture
 

voyage _abraham lincoln_ long time marked no
 special incident. one circumstance happened showed the
 wonderful dexterity ned land, proved confidence might
 place him.
 
30th june, frigate spoke american whalers, we
 learned knew nothing narwhal. one them, the
 captain _monroe_, knowing ned land shipped board the
 _abraham lincoln_, begged help chasing whale in
 sight. commander farragut, desirous seeing ned land work, gave
 permission go board _monroe_. fate served our
 canadian well that, instead one whale, harpooned two a

 heard:
 
“the thing port quarter!” cried harpooner.
 
every eye turned towards point indicated. there, mile a

 observed animal attentively, called engineer. the
 engineer ran him.
 
“sir,” said commander, “you steam up?”
 
“yes, sir,” answered engineer.
 
“well, make fires put steam.”
 
three hurrahs greeted order. time struggle had

“well, mr. land,” asked captain, “do advise put boats

“no, sir,” replied ned land; “because shall take beast

“what shall then?”
 
“put steam can, sir. leave, mean post

“you turned full steam in?”
 
“yes, sir,” replied engineer.

chase began again, captain, leaning towards me, said—
 
“i will pursue beast till frigate bursts up.”
 
“yes,” answered i; “and will quite right it.”
 
wished beast exhaust itself, insensible to

narwhal seemed motionless; perhaps, tired day’s work, it
 slept, letting float undulation waves. now a

 electric light went suddenly, two enormous waterspouts
 broke bridge frigate, rushing like torrent stem

“is you?” said i, “you?”
 
“myself,” answered conseil; “and waiting master’s orders.”
 
“that shock threw well sea?”
 
“no; master’s service, followed him.”
 
worthy fellow thought natural.
 
“and frigate?” asked.
 
“the frigate?” replied conseil, turning back; “i think that
 master better count much her.”
 
“you think so?”
 
“i say that, time threw sea, heard men

“broken?”
 
“yes, broken monster’s teeth. injury _abraham

“then lost!”
 
“perhaps so,” calmly answered conseil. “however, still several
 hours us, one can good deal hours.”
 
conseil’s imperturbable coolness set again. swam more
 vigorously; but, cramped clothes, stuck like leaden
 weight, felt great difficulty bearing up. conseil saw this.
 
“will master let make slit?” said he; and, slipping open knife
 clothes, ripped top bottom rapidly.

conseil, continued swim near each

nevertheless, situation less terrible. perhaps our
 disappearance noticed; been, frigate

 supposition, laid plans accordingly. phlegmatic boy was
 perfectly self-possessed. decided that, chance of

“explain yourself, ned!”

“oh! confound it!” cried ned land, kicking resounding plate. “open,

commander vessel thus spoke.
 
words, ned land rose suddenly. steward, nearly strangled,
 tottered sign master; power the
 commander board, gesture betrayed resentment which
 man must felt towards canadian. conseil, interested in
 spite himself, stupefied, awaited silence result this
 scene.
 
commander, leaning corner table arms
 folded, scanned us profound attention. hesitate speak?
 regret words just spoken french? one might
 almost think so.
 
moments silence, one us dreamed breaking,
 “gentlemen,” said he, calm penetrating voice, “i speak french,
 english, german, latin equally well. could, therefore, have
 answered first interview, wished know first,
 reflect. story told one, entirely agreeing the
 main points, convinced identity. know now chance has
 brought m. pierre aronnax, professor natural history at
 museum paris, entrusted scientific mission abroad,
 conseil, servant, ned land, canadian origin, harpooner on
 board frigate _abraham lincoln_ navy united states of
 america.”
 
bowed assent. question commander put me.
 therefore answer made. man expressed himself
 perfect ease, without accent. sentences well turned,
 words clear, fluency speech remarkable. yet, not
 recognise fellow-countryman.
 
continued conversation terms:
 
“you doubtless thought, sir, delayed long paying
 second visit. reason that, identity recognised, i
 wished weigh maturely part act towards you. hesitated
 much. annoying circumstances brought presence of
 man broken ties humanity. come trouble
 existence.”
 
“unintentionally!” said i.
 
“unintentionally?” replied stranger, raising voice little;
 “was unintentionally _abraham lincoln_ pursued over
 seas? unintentionally took passage frigate?
 unintentionally cannon balls rebounded plating
 vessel? unintentionally mr. ned land struck with
 harpoon?”
 
detected restrained irritation words. these
 recriminations natural answer make made it.
 
“sir,” said i, “no doubt ignorant discussions have
 taken place concerning america europe. know that
 divers accidents, caused collisions submarine machine,
 excited public feeling two continents. omit the
 hypotheses without number sought explain the
 inexplicable phenomenon alone possess secret. you
 must understand that, pursuing high seas the
 pacific, _abraham lincoln_ believed chasing some
 powerful sea-monster, necessary rid ocean any
 price.”
 
half-smile curled lips commander: then, calmer tone—
 
“m. aronnax,” replied, “dare affirm frigate not
 soon pursued cannonaded submarine boat monster?”
 
question embarrassed me, certainly captain farragut might not
 hesitated. might thought duty destroy a
 contrivance kind, gigantic narwhal.
 
“you understand then, sir,” continued stranger, “that the
 right treat enemies?”
 
answered nothing, purposely. good discuss
 proposition, force destroy best arguments?
 
“i hesitated time,” continued commander; “nothing obliged
 show hospitality. chose separate you, i
 interest seeing again; place upon the
 deck vessel served refuge, sink
 beneath waters, forget ever existed. not
 right?”
 
“it might right savage,” answered, “but a
 civilised man.”
 
“professor,” replied commander, quickly, “i call a
 civilised man! done society entirely, reasons i

said plainly. flash anger disdain kindled eyes

 sole judges answerable.
 
reflections crossed mind rapidly, whilst stranger
 personage silent, absorbed, wrapped himself. i
 regarded fear mingled interest, doubtless, Œdipus
 regarded sphinx.
 
rather long silence, commander resumed conversation.
 
“i hesitated,” said he, “but thought interest might

 will free; and, exchange liberty, shall impose

“speak, sir,” answered. “i suppose condition one man

“yes, sir; this. possible certain events, unforeseen,

things took place board which, say least, singular,

 pale social laws. amongst surprises future was
 preparing me, might least.
 
“we accept,” answered; “only will ask permission, sir, to
 address one question you—one only.”
 
“speak, sir.”
 
“you said free board.”
 
“entirely.”
 
“i ask you, then, mean liberty?”
 
“just liberty go, come, see, observe even that

evident understand one another.
 
“pardon me, sir,” resumed, “but liberty every

“it must suffice you, however.”
 
“what! must renounce ever seeing country, friends, our
 relations again?”
 
“yes, sir. renounce unendurable worldly yoke men
 believe liberty, perhaps painful think.”
 
“well,” exclaimed ned land, “never will give word honour to
 try escape.”
 
“i ask word honour, master land,” answered the
 commander, coldly.
 
“sir,” replied, beginning get angry spite myself, “you abuse
 situation towards us; cruelty.”
 
“no, sir, clemency. prisoners war. keep you, when
 could, word, plunge depths ocean. you
 attacked me. came surprise secret man world
 must penetrate,—the secret whole existence. think i

words indicated resolution taken part commander,
 arguments prevail.
 
“so, sir,” rejoined, “you give us simply choice life and
 death?”
 
“simply.”
 
“my friends,” said i, “to question thus put, nothing to
 answer. word honour binds us master vessel.”
 
“none, sir,” answered unknown.
 
then, gentler tone, continued—
 
“now, permit finish say you. know you, m.
 aronnax. companions will not, perhaps, much to

words commander great effect upon me. deny
 it. weak point touched; forgot, moment, the
 contemplation sublime subjects worth loss of
 liberty. besides, trusted future decide grave
 question. contented saying—
 
“by name address you?”
 
“sir,” replied commander, “i nothing captain nemo;
 companions nothing passengers the
 _nautilus_.”
 
captain nemo called. steward appeared. captain gave his
 orders strange language understand. then,
 turning towards canadian conseil—
 
“a repast awaits cabin,” said he. “be good follow
 man.
 
“and now, m. aronnax, breakfast ready. permit lead the
 way.”
 
“i service, captain.”

 found kind passage lighted electricity, similar to

“the greater part dishes unknown you,” said me.
 “however, may partake without fear. wholesome and

“you like sea, captain?”
 
“yes; love it! everything. covers seven-tenths the

captain nemo suddenly became silent midst enthusiasm, by

“now, professor,” said he, “if wish go _nautilus_, am

“captain nemo,” said host, just thrown one

 consider can follow bottom seas.”
 
“where one find greater solitude silence, professor?” replied
 captain nemo. “did study museum afford perfect

thanked captain nemo, went shelves library.
 works science, morals, literature abounded every language;
 see one single work political economy; subject
 appeared strictly proscribed. strange say, books
 irregularly arranged, whatever language written; and
 medley proved captain _nautilus_ must read
 indiscriminately books took chance.
 
“sir,” said captain, “i thank placed this
 library disposal. contains treasures science, shall
 profit them.”
 
“this room library,” said captain nemo, “it also a

“a smoking-room!” cried. “then one may smoke board?”
 
“certainly.”
 
“then, sir, forced believe kept a

“not any,” answered captain. “accept cigar, m. aronnax; and,

“it excellent, tobacco.”
 
“no!” answered captain, “this tobacco comes neither havannah

“you examining shells, professor? unquestionably must be

“it actually manometer. communication water, whose

“yes, sir.”
 
“nevertheless, captain, possess extreme rapidity movement,

“here, m. aronnax, several dimensions boat in.

 cubic contents _nautilus_. area measures 6032 feet; its
 contents 1500 cubic yards—that say, completely

“when made plans submarine vessel, meant that
 nine-tenths submerged: consequently, to
 displace nine-tenths bulk—that say, weigh that

 constructing aforesaid dimensions.
 
“the _nautilus_ composed two hulls, one inside, other

 owing cellular arrangement resists like block, it

“i do.”
 
“then, _nautilus_ afloat circumstances,

“well, captain, now come real difficulty. can
 understand rising surface; diving surface,

 consequently undergo upward thrust one atmosphere every

“just so, sir.”
 
“then, unless quite fill _nautilus_, see can

“professor, must confound statics dynamics will be
 exposed grave errors. little labour spent attaining

“that evident.”

nothing object reasonings.
 
“i admit calculations, captain,” replied; “i wrong to
 dispute since daily experience confirms them; foresee real
 difficulty way.”
 
“what, sir?”
 
“when 1000 feet deep, walls _nautilus_ bear a
 pressure 100 atmospheres. if, then, just now empty the
 supplementary reservoirs, lighten vessel, go the
 surface, pumps must overcome pressure 100 atmospheres, which

“that electricity alone can give,” said captain, hastily. “i

“what they, captain?”
 
“that involves telling _nautilus_ worked.”
 
“i impatient learn.”
 
“to steer boat starboard port, turn—in word, following

“bravo, captain! can steersman follow route the

“the steersman placed glazed box, raised hull

“are lenses capable resisting pressure?”
 
“perfectly. glass, breaks blow, is, nevertheless, capable of
 offering considerable resistance. experiments fishing by
 electric light 1864 northern seas, saw plates less a
 third inch thick resist pressure sixteen atmospheres. now,
 glass use less thirty times thicker.”
 
“granted. but, all, order see, light must exceed the
 darkness, midst darkness water, can you

“behind steersman’s cage placed powerful electric reflector,

“ah! bravo, bravo, captain! now can account phosphorescence

“quite accidental, sir. sailing one fathom surface

“none, sir. now, rencontre _abraham lincoln?_”
 
“professor, sorry one best vessels american

“ah, commander! _nautilus_ certainly marvellous boat.”
 
“yes, professor; love part myself. danger

“but construct wonderful _nautilus_ secret?”

“but parts put together arranged?”
 
“professor, set workshops upon desert island the

“then cost vessel great?”
 
“m. aronnax, iron vessel costs £145 per ton. now _nautilus_
 weighed 1500. came therefore £67,500, £80,000 for

“one last question, captain nemo.”
 
“ask it, professor.”
 
“you rich?”
 
“immensely rich, sir; could, without missing it, pay national

captain nemo, commander _nautilus_.
 

“a hunt!” exclaimed ned.
 
“and forests island crespo!” added conseil.
 
“oh! gentleman going _terra firma?_” replied ned land.
 
“that seems clearly indicated,” said i, reading letter

“sir, proposed hunt submarine forest crespo,

“but captain, believe me——”
 
“be kind enough listen, will see whether any

“i listen.”
 
“you know well do, professor, man can live water,

“that diving apparatus,” said i.
 
“just so, conditions man liberty; is

“and means getting free?” asked.
 
“it use rouquayrol apparatus, invented two own

“right! told you, m. aronnax, pumps _nautilus_
 allow store air considerable pressure, those
 conditions reservoir apparatus can furnish breathable air

“i objections make,” answered; “i will ask
 one thing, captain—how can light road bottom the

“with ruhmkorff apparatus, m. aronnax; one carried back,

“captain nemo, objections make crushing answers,
 dare longer doubt. forced admit rouquayrol
 ruhmkorff apparatus, must allowed reservations with

“but gun powder,” answered captain.
 
“then air-gun.”
 
“doubtless! manufacture gunpowder board,
 without either saltpetre, sulphur, charcoal?”
 
“besides,” added, “to fire water medium eight hundred and
 fifty-five times denser air, must conquer considerable

“that difficulty. exist guns, according fulton,

“but air must rapidly used?”
 
“well, rouquayrol reservoir, can furnish at

 that, submarine hunt, can spend little air
 balls.”
 
“but seems twilight, midst this
 fluid, dense compared atmosphere, shots could
 go far, easily prove mortal.”
 
“sir, contrary, gun every blow mortal; however
 lightly animal touched, falls struck thunderbolt.”
 
“why?”
 
“because balls sent gun ordinary balls, little
 cases glass (invented leniebroek, austrian chemist), which
 large supply. glass cases covered case of
 steel, weighted pellet lead; real leyden
 bottles, electricity forced high tension.
 slightest shock discharged, animal, however
 strong may be, falls dead. must tell cases size

“i will argue longer,” replied, rising table; “i have
 nothing left take gun. events, will go you
 go.”
 
captain nemo led aft; passing ned’s conseil’s

“there alternative, master ned.”
 
“as please, sir,” replied harpooner, shrugging shoulders;
 “but me, unless forced, will never get one.”
 
“no one will force you, master ned,” said captain nemo.
 
“is conseil going risk it?” asked ned.
 
“i follow master wherever goes,” replied conseil.

forest composed large tree-plants; moment we
 penetrated vast arcades, struck singular
 position branches—a position yet observed.
 
herb carpeted ground, branch clothed the
 trees, either broken bent, extend horizontally; all
 stretched surface ocean. filament, ribbon,
 however thin might be, kept straight rod iron. the
 fuci llianas grew rigid perpendicular lines, due density

 one side hand, directly resumed former position.
 truly region perpendicularity!
 
soon accustomed fantastic position, well the
 comparative darkness surrounded us. soil forest seemed
 covered sharp blocks, difficult avoid. submarine flora
 struck perfect, richer even have

 mistaken? fauna flora closely

 scarlet ceramies, whose laminaries extended edible shoots of
 fern-shaped nereocysti, grow height fifteen feet;
 clusters acetabuli, whose stems increase size upwards; and
 numbers marine plants, devoid flowers!
 
“curious anomaly, fantastic element!” said ingenious naturalist, “in

next morning, 18th november, quite recovered my
 fatigues day before, went platform, just as
 second lieutenant uttering daily phrase.
 
admiring magnificent aspect ocean captain nemo
 appeared. seem aware presence, began a
 series astronomical observations. then, finished, he
 went leant cage watch-light, gazed abstractedly
 ocean. meantime, number sailors the
 _nautilus_, strong healthy men, come onto platform.
 came draw nets laid night. these
 sailors evidently different nations, although european type
 visible them. recognised unmistakable irishmen,
 frenchmen, sclaves, greek, candiote. civil,
 used odd language among themselves, origin i
 guess, neither question them.
 
nets hauled in. large kind “chaluts,” like
 normandy coasts, great pockets waves chain
 fixed smaller meshes kept open. pockets, drawn iron
 poles, swept water, gathered everything their
 way. day brought curious specimens productive
 coasts.
 
reckoned haul brought nine hundredweight of
 fish. fine haul, wondered at. indeed, nets
 let several hours, enclose meshes infinite
 variety. lack excellent food, rapidity the
 _nautilus_ attraction electric light always renew
 supply. several productions immediately
 lowered panel steward’s room, eaten
 fresh, others pickled.
 
fishing ended, provision air renewed, thought the
 _nautilus_ continue submarine excursion, was
 preparing return room, when, without preamble, the
 captain turned me, saying:
 
“professor, ocean gifted real life? tempers

 discovered circulation real circulation blood in

“yes, ocean indeed circulation, promote it, creator
 caused things multiply it—caloric, salt, animalculae.”
 
captain nemo spoke thus, seemed altogether changed, aroused
 extraordinary emotion me.
 
“also,” added, “true existence there; can imagine the
 foundations nautical towns, clusters submarine houses, which,
 like _nautilus_, ascend every morning breathe the
 surface water, free towns, independent cities. yet knows
 whether despot——”
 
captain nemo finished sentence violent gesture. then,
 addressing chase away sorrowful thought:
 
“m. aronnax,” asked, “do know depth ocean?”
 
“i know, captain, principal soundings taught us.”
 
“could tell them, can suit purpose?”
 
“these some,” replied, “that remember. mistaken, a
 depth 8,000 yards found north atlantic, 2,500
 yards mediterranean. remarkable soundings been
 made south atlantic, near thirty-fifth parallel, they
 gave 12,000 yards, 14,000 yards, 15,000 yards. sum all, is
 reckoned bottom levelled, mean depth

“well, professor,” replied captain, “we shall show better than
 hope. mean depth part pacific, tell
 4,000 yards.”
 
said this, captain nemo went towards panel, disappeared

 screw immediately put motion, log gave twenty miles

days weeks passed, captain nemo sparing of
 visits. seldom saw him. lieutenant pricked ship’s course
 regularly chart, always tell exactly route the

nearly every day, time, panels drawing-room were
 opened, never tired penetrating mysteries the

 saw, three miles off, martin’s peak nouka-hiva, largest the

 azure fins tails like gold, flesh unrivalled; some
 nearly destitute scales, exquisite flavour; others, bony
 jaws, yellow-tinged gills, good bonitos; fish would
 use us. leaving charming islands protected the
 french flag, 4th 11th december _nautilus_ sailed

 interrupted me.
 
“will master come moment?” said, curious voice.
 
“what matter, conseil?”
 
“i want master look.”
 
rose, went, leaned elbows panes watched.

terrible spectacle forerunner series maritime
 catastrophes _nautilus_ destined meet its
 route. long went frequented waters, often saw
 hulls shipwrecked vessels rotting depths, and
 deeper cannons, bullets, anchors, chains, thousand other
 iron materials eaten rust. however, 11th december we
 sighted pomotou islands, old “dangerous group” bougainville,
 extend space 500 leagues e.s.e. w.n.w., the
 island ducie lazareff. group covers area 370
 square leagues, formed sixty groups islands, among
 gambier group remarkable, france exercises

 daily work polypi. new island will joined later
 neighboring groups, fifth continent will stretch from
 new zealand new caledonia, thence marquesas.
 
one day, suggesting theory captain nemo, replied
 coldly:
 
“the earth want new continents, new men.”
 
chance conducted _nautilus_ towards island of

towards evening clermont-tonnerre lost distance, the
 route _nautilus_ sensibly changed. crossed the
 tropic capricorn 135° longitude, sailed w.n.w., making again
 tropical zone. although summer sun strong, did
 suffer heat, fifteen twenty fathoms the
 surface, temperature rise ten twelve degrees.
 
15th december, left east bewitching group the

25th december _nautilus_ sailed midst new

 composed principally nine large islands, form band 120

 morning 27th, came large drawing-room, always
 seeming seen five minutes before. busily tracing

 me, put finger one spot chart, said single word.
 
“vanikoro.”
 
effect magical! name islands la
 perouse lost! rose suddenly.
 
“the _nautilus_ brought us vanikoro?” asked.
 
“yes, professor,” said captain.
 
“and can visit celebrated islands boussole the
 astrolabe struck?”
 
“if like, professor.”
 
“when shall there?”
 
“we now.”
 
followed captain nemo, went platform, greedily
 scanned horizon.
 
n.e. two volcanic islands emerged unequal size, surrounded by
 coral reef measured forty miles circumference. close

just captain nemo asked knew wreck la

“only everyone knows, captain,” replied.
 
“and tell everyone knows it?” inquired,
 ironically.
 
“easily.”
 
related last works dumont d’urville made
 known—works following brief account.
 
perouse, second, captain langle, sent louis xvi,
 1785, voyage circumnavigation. embarked the
 corvettes boussole astrolabe, neither heard

 esperance, left brest 28th september command of
 bruni d’entrecasteaux.
 
two months after, learned bowen, commander albemarle,
 debris shipwrecked vessels seen coasts of
 new georgia. d’entrecasteaux, ignoring communication—rather
 uncertain, besides—directed course towards admiralty islands,
 mentioned report captain hunter’s place la
 perouse wrecked.
 
sought vain. esperance recherche passed before
 vanikoro without stopping there, and, fact, voyage most
 disastrous, cost d’entrecasteaux life, two of
 lieutenants, besides several crew.
 
captain dillon, shrewd old pacific sailor, first find
 unmistakable traces wrecks. 15th may, 1824, his
 vessel, st. patrick, passed close tikopia, one new

 run aground reefs years ago.
 
dillon guessed meant perouse, whose disappearance had

23rd, several officers went round island brought back
 unimportant trifles. natives, adopting system denials and
 evasions, refused take unlucky place. ambiguous
 conduct led believe natives ill-treated the
 castaways, indeed seemed fear dumont d’urville had
 come avenge perouse unfortunate crew.
 
however, 26th, appeased presents, understanding that
 reprisals fear, led m. jacquireot scene of

there, three four fathoms water, reefs pacou

 limy concretions. large boat whaler belonging the
 astrolabe sent place, and, without difficulty,
 crews hauled anchor weighing 1,800 lbs., brass gun, some
 pigs iron, two copper swivel-guns.
 
dumont d’urville, questioning natives, learned perouse,

“so,” said, “no one knows now third vessel perished that

“no one knows.”
 
captain nemo said nothing, signed follow the

 panels opened.
 
hastened aperture, crustations coral, covered
 fungi, syphonules, alcyons, madrepores, myriads of
 charming fish—girelles, glyphisidri, pompherides, diacopes, and
 holocentres—i recognised certain debris drags been
 able tear up—iron stirrups, anchors, cannons, bullets, capstan
 fittings, stem ship, objects clearly proving wreck of
 vessel, now carpeted living flowers. looking
 desolate scene, captain nemo said, sad voice:
 
“commander perouse set 7th december, 1785, vessels la
 boussole astrolabe. first cast anchor botany bay, visited
 friendly isles, new caledonia, directed course towards
 santa cruz, put namouka, one hapai group. his
 vessels struck unknown reefs vanikoro. boussole, which
 went first, ran aground southerly coast. astrolabe went to
 help, ran aground too. first vessel destroyed almost
 immediately. second, stranded wind, resisted days.
 natives made castaways welcome. installed in
 island, constructed smaller boat debris two
 large ones. sailors stayed willingly vanikoro; others, weak
 ill, set perouse. directed course towards
 solomon islands, perished, everything, the
 westerly coast chief island group, capes
 deception satisfaction.”
 
“how know that?”
 
“by this, found spot last wreck.”
 
captain nemo showed tin-plate box, stamped french arms,
 corroded salt water. opened it, saw bundle of
 papers, yellow still readable.

“ah! fine death sailor!” said captain nemo, last. “a

two days crossing coral sea, 4th january, sighted the
 papuan coasts. occasion, captain nemo informed his
 intention get indian ocean strait torres. his
 communication ended there.
 
torres straits nearly thirty-four leagues wide; are
 obstructed innumerable quantity islands, islets, breakers, and
 rocks, make navigation almost impracticable; captain
 nemo took needful precautions cross them. _nautilus_,
 floating betwixt wind water, went moderate pace. screw,
 like cetacean’s tail, beat waves slowly.
 
profiting this, two companions went deserted

 furiously. course waves, went south-east to
 north-west rate two half miles, broke coral that
 showed there.
 
“this bad sea!” remarked ned land.
 
“detestable indeed, one suit boat like the
 _nautilus_.”
 
“the captain must sure route, see pieces of
 coral keel touched slightly.”
 
indeed situation dangerous, _nautilus_ seemed slide
 like magic rocks. follow routes the
 astrolabe zelee exactly, proved fatal dumont
 d’urville. bore northwards, coasted islands murray, and
 came back south-west towards cumberland passage. thought it
 going pass by, when, going back north-west, went
 large quantity islands islets little known, towards
 island sound canal mauvais.
 
wondered captain nemo, foolishly imprudent, steer vessel
 pass dumont d’urville’s two corvettes touched; when,
 swerving again, cutting straight west, steered
 island gilboa.
 
three afternoon. tide began recede, being
 quite full. _nautilus_ approached island, still saw,
 remarkable border screw-pines. stood two
 miles distant. suddenly shock overthrew me. _nautilus_ just
 touched rock, stayed immovable, laying lightly port side.
 
rose, perceived captain nemo lieutenant the
 platform. examining situation vessel, and
 exchanging words incomprehensible dialect.
 
situated thus: two miles, starboard side, appeared
 gilboa, stretching north west like immense arm. towards the
 south east coral showed itself, left ebb. run
 aground, one seas tides middling—a sorry
 matter floating _nautilus_. however, vessel not
 suffered, keel solidly joined. but, neither
 glide move, ran risk ever fastened to
 rocks, captain nemo’s submarine vessel done
 for.
 
reflecting thus, captain, cool calm, always master
 himself, approached me.
 
“an accident?” asked.
 
“no; incident.”
 
“but incident will oblige perhaps become inhabitant
 land flee?”
 
captain nemo looked curiously, made negative gesture, as
 much say nothing force set foot terra firma
 again. said:
 
“besides, m. aronnax, _nautilus_ lost; will carry yet
 midst marvels ocean. voyage begun,
 wish deprived soon honour your
 company.”
 
“however, captain nemo,” replied, without noticing ironical turn
 phrase, “the _nautilus_ ran aground open sea. now tides
 strong pacific; and, lighten the
 _nautilus_, see will reinflated.”
 
“the tides strong pacific: right there,
 professor; torres straits one finds still difference yard
 half level high low seas. to-day 4th
 january, five days moon will full. now, shall very
 much astonished satellite raise masses water
 sufficiently, render service indebted her

said this, captain nemo, followed lieutenant, redescended
 interior _nautilus_. vessel, moved not, and
 immovable, coralline polypi already walled with
 destructible cement.
 
“well, sir?” said ned land, came departure of
 captain.
 
“well, friend ned, will wait patiently tide 9th
 instant; appears moon will goodness put it

“really?”
 
“really.”
 
“and captain going cast anchor since tide
 will suffice?” said conseil, simply.
 
canadian looked conseil, shrugged shoulders.
 
“sir, may believe tell piece iron will
 navigate neither again; fit sold

“friend ned, despair stout _nautilus_, do; and
 four days shall know hold pacific tides.
 besides, flight might possible sight english or

 will time enough come extremity _nautilus_ does
 recover again, look upon grave event.”
 
“but know, least, act circumspectly? an

“in this, friend ned right,” said conseil, “and agree him.
 master obtain permission friend captain nemo put

“i can ask him, will refuse.”
 
“will master risk it?” asked conseil, “and shall know rely
 upon captain’s amiability.”
 
great surprise, captain nemo gave permission asked for,
 gave agreeably, without even exacting promise

eight o’clock, armed guns hatchets, got the

ned land restrain joy. like prisoner had

“meat! going eat meat; meat!” replied. “real
 game! no, bread, indeed.”
 
“i say fish good; must abuse it; piece
 fresh venison, grilled live coals, will agreeably vary our
 ordinary course.”
 
“glutton!” said conseil, “he makes mouth water.”
 
“it remains seen,” said, “if forests full game,
 game will hunt hunter himself.”
 
“well said, m. aronnax,” replied canadian, whose teeth seemed
 sharpened like edge hatchet; “but will eat tiger—loin of
 tiger—if quadruped island.”
 
“friend ned uneasy it,” said conseil.
 
“whatever may be,” continued ned land, “every animal four paws
 without feathers, two paws without feathers, will saluted by

“very well! master land’s imprudences beginning.”
 
“never fear, m. aronnax,” replied canadian; “i want

 novel proposal captain nemo’s
 

28th february, noon _nautilus_ came the
 surface sea, 9° 4′ n. lat., land sight about
 eight miles westward. first thing noticed range of
 mountains two thousand feet high, shapes most
 capricious. taking bearings, knew nearing the
 island ceylon, pearl hangs lobe indian

captain nemo second appeared moment. captain
 glanced map. turning me, said:
 
“the island ceylon, noted pearl-fisheries. like to
 visit one them, m. aronnax?”
 
“certainly, captain.”
 
“well, thing easy. though, see fisheries, shall not
 see fishermen. annual exportation yet begun. never
 mind, will give orders make gulf manaar, shall
 arrive night.”
 
captain said something second, immediately went out.
 soon _nautilus_ returned native element, manometer
 showed thirty feet deep.
 
“well, sir,” said captain nemo, “you companions shall visit
 bank manaar, chance fisherman there, we
 shall see work.”
 
“agreed, captain!”
 
“by bye, m. aronnax afraid sharks?”
 
“sharks!” exclaimed i.
 
question seemed hard one.
 
“well?” continued captain nemo.
 
“i admit, captain, yet familiar kind of
 fish.”
 
“we accustomed them,” replied captain nemo, “and time you
 will too. however, shall armed, road may able
 hunt tribe. interesting. so, till to-morrow, sir,
 early.”
 
said careless tone, captain nemo left saloon. now, you
 invited hunt bear mountains switzerland, what
 say?
 
“very well! to-morrow will go hunt bear.” asked
 hunt lion plains atlas, tiger indian

“ha! ha! seems going hunt tiger lion!” when
 invited hunt shark natural element, would
 perhaps reflect accepting invitation. myself, i
 passed hand forehead, stood large drops cold

 almost certain meet sharks, quite another thing! know well that
 certain countries, particularly andaman islands, negroes
 never hesitate attack dagger one hand running

 creatures ever return alive. however, negro, i
 think little hesitation case ill-timed.”
 
moment conseil canadian entered, quite composed, and
 even joyous. knew awaited them.
 
“faith, sir,” said ned land, “your captain nemo—the devil take him!—has
 just made us pleasant offer.”
 
“ah!” said i, “you know?”
 
“if agreeable you, sir,” interrupted conseil, “the commander the
 _nautilus_ invited us visit magnificent ceylon fisheries
 to-morrow, company; kindly, behaved like real
 gentleman.”
 
“he said nothing more?”
 
“nothing more, sir, except already spoken this
 little walk.”
 
“sir,” said conseil, “would give us details pearl
 fishery?”
 
“as fishing itself,” asked, “or incidents, which?”
 
“on fishing,” replied canadian; “before entering upon the
 ground, well know something it.”
 
“very well; sit down, friends, will teach you.”
 
ned conseil seated ottoman, first thing
 canadian asked was:
 
“sir, pearl?”
 
“my worthy ned,” answered, “to poet, pearl tear the
 sea; orientals, drop dew solidified; ladies,
 jewel oblong shape, brilliancy mother-of-pearl

 producing pearls.”
 
“mussels too?” asked canadian.
 
“yes, mussels certain waters scotland, wales, ireland, saxony,
 bohemia, france.”

“but,” continued, “the particular mollusc secretes pearl is

“are many pearls found oyster?” asked conseil.
 
“yes, boy. perfect casket. one oyster mentioned,

“a hundred fifty sharks!” exclaimed ned land.
 
“did say sharks?” said hurriedly. “i meant say hundred and
 fifty pearls. sharks sense.”
 
“certainly not,” said conseil; “but will tell us now means

“they proceed various ways. adhere shell, the
 fishermen often pull pincers; common way is

“the price pearls varies according size?” asked
 conseil.
 
“not according size,” answered, “but also according to

“but,” said conseil, “is pearl-fishery dangerous?”
 
“no,” answered, quickly; “particularly certain precautions are
 taken.”
 
“what one risk calling?” said ned land, “the swallowing
 mouthfuls sea-water?”
 
“as say, ned. bye,” said i, trying take captain nemo’s
 careless tone, “are afraid sharks, brave ned?”
 
“i!” replied canadian; “a harpooner profession? trade
 make light them.”
 
“but,” said i, “it question fishing an

“then, question of——”
 
“precisely.”
 
“in water?”
 
“in water.”
 
“faith, good harpoon! know, sir, sharks are
 ill-fashioned beasts. turn bellies seize you, in

ned land way saying “seize” made blood run cold.
 
“well, you, conseil, think sharks?”
 
“me!” said conseil. “i will frank, sir.”
 
“so much better,” thought i.
 
“if you, sir, mean face sharks, see faithful

next morning four o’clock awakened steward whom
 captain nemo placed service. rose hurriedly, dressed, and
 went saloon.
 
captain nemo awaiting me.
 
“m. aronnax,” said he, “are ready start?”
 
“i ready.”
 
“then please follow me.”
 
“and companions, captain?”
 
“they told waiting.”
 
“are put diver’s dresses?” asked i.
 
“not yet. allowed _nautilus_ come near this
 coast, distance manaar bank; boat is
 ready, will take us exact point disembarking, will
 save us long way. carries diving apparatus, will put
 begin submarine journey.”
 
captain nemo conducted central staircase, led the
 platform. ned conseil already there, delighted idea of
 “pleasure party” preparing. five sailors the
 _nautilus_, oars, waited boat, made
 fast side.
 
night still dark. layers clouds covered sky, allowing
 stars seen. looked side land lay, and
 saw nothing dark line enclosing three parts horizon, from
 south-west north west. _nautilus_, returned the
 night western coast ceylon, now west bay, or
 rather gulf, formed mainland island manaar. there,
 dark waters, stretched pintadine bank, inexhaustible
 field pearls, length twenty miles.
 
captain nemo, ned land, conseil, took places stern of
 boat. master went tiller; four companions leaned on
 oars, painter cast off, sheered off.
 
boat went towards south; oarsmen hurry. noticed
 strokes, strong water, followed every
 ten seconds, according method generally adopted navy.
 whilst craft running velocity, liquid drops
 struck dark depths waves crisply like spats melted lead.
 little billow, spreading wide, gave slight roll boat, and
 samphire reeds flapped it.
 
silent. captain nemo thinking of? perhaps land
 approaching, found near him, contrary the
 canadian’s opinion, thought far off. conseil, was
 merely curiosity.
 
half-past five first tints horizon showed upper

 indistinct owing mist water. six o’clock became
 suddenly daylight, rapidity peculiar tropical regions,

sign anchor dropped, chain scarcely ran,

“here are, m. aronnax,” said captain nemo. “you see enclosed
 bay? here, month will assembled numerous fishing boats of
 exporters, waters divers will ransack so
 boldly. happily, bay well situated kind fishing. it
 sheltered strongest winds; never rough

answer, and, watching suspected waves, began with
 help sailors put heavy sea-dress. captain nemo and
 companions also dressing. none _nautilus_ men to

“they useless,” replied. “we going great depth,

captain nemo pronounced words, turned conseil ned

one last question remained ask captain nemo.
 
“and arms?” asked i; “our guns?”
 
“guns! for? mountaineers attack bear dagger in
 hand, steel surer lead? strong blade;
 put belt, start.”
 
looked companions; armed like us, and, than
 that, ned land brandishing enormous harpoon, placed

next day (30th january), _nautilus_ went surface of

 say. this, however, satisfy canadian, that
 day came asking going.
 
“we going captain’s fancy takes us, master ned.”
 
“his fancy take us far, then,” said canadian. “the persian
 gulf outlet: and, go in, will long we
 again.”
 
“very well, then, will come again, master land; if, after
 persian gulf, _nautilus_ like visit red sea, the
 straits bab-el-mandeb give us entrance.”
 
“i need tell you, sir,” said ned land, “that red much
 closed gulf, isthmus suez yet cut; and, it
 was, boat mysterious risk canal cut

“but never said going back europe.”
 
“what suppose, then?”
 
“i suppose that, visiting curious coasts arabia egypt,
 _nautilus_ will go indian ocean again, perhaps cross the
 channel mozambique, perhaps mascarenhas, gain the

“and cape good hope?” asked canadian, peculiar
 emphasis.
 
“well, shall penetrate atlantic yet know.
 ah! friend ned, getting tired journey sea;

four days, till 3rd february, _nautilus_ scoured sea

certainly thought captain nemo, arrived point, would

 surprise.
 
next day, 7th february, entered straits of
 bab-el-mandeb, name which, arab tongue, means gate of
 tears.
 
twenty miles breadth, thirty-two length. for
 _nautilus_, starting full speed, crossing scarcely the

“well, sir, red please you? sufficiently

“yes, captain nemo,” replied; “and _nautilus_ wonderfully

“yes, sir, intelligent invulnerable. fears neither terrible

“certainly,” said i, “this quoted one worst, in

“detestable, m. aronnax. greek latin historians speak

“one may see,” replied, “that historians never sailed board

“just so,” replied captain, smiling; “and respect moderns

“it true,” answered; “your boat least century its

captain nemo reply. minutes’ silence continued:
 
“you speaking opinions ancient historians upon the

“it true,” said i; “but fears exaggerated?”
 
“yes no, m. aronnax,” replied captain nemo, seemed know the

“there exist several explanations subject, m. aronnax. you

“willingly.”
 
“this fanciful writer pretends name given the

“a poet’s explanation, captain nemo,” replied; “but content

“here is, m. aronnax. according idea, must see this

“but time seen nothing transparent waves and

“that evident,” replied; “and sake archaeologists let
 us hope excavations will made sooner later, new

“well, unless _nautilus_ sails dry land, passes the

“or beneath it, m. aronnax.”
 
“beneath it?”

“what! passage exists?”
 
“yes; subterranean passage, named arabian tunnel. it
 takes us beneath suez opens gulf pelusium.”
 
“but isthmus composed nothing quick sands?”

chapter v
 arabian tunnel
 

evening, 21° 30′ n. lat., _nautilus_ floated the
 surface sea, approaching arabian coast. saw djeddah, the
 important counting-house egypt, syria, turkey, india. i
 distinguished clearly enough buildings, vessels anchored the
 quays, whose draught water obliged anchor the
 roads. sun, rather low horizon, struck full houses of
 town, bringing whiteness. outside, wooden cabins,
 made reeds, showed quarter inhabited bedouins.
 soon djeddah shut view shadows night, the
 _nautilus_ found water slightly phosphorescent.
 
next day, 10th february, sighted several ships running to
 windward. _nautilus_ returned submarine navigation; at
 noon, bearings taken, deserted, rose
 waterline.
 
accompanied ned conseil, seated platform. the
 coast eastern side looked like mass faintly printed upon a
 damp fog.
 
leaning sides pinnace, talking one thing and
 another, ned land, stretching hand towards spot the
 sea, said:
 
“do see anything there, sir?”
 
“no, ned,” replied; “but eyes, know.”
 
“look well,” said ned, “there, starboard beam, height
 lantern! see mass seems move?”
 
“certainly,” said i, close attention; “i see something like a
 long black body top water.”
 
certainly long black object mile

 gigantic dugong!
 
ned land looked eagerly. eyes shone covetousness sight
 animal. hand seemed ready harpoon it. one have
 thought awaiting moment throw and
 attack element.
 
instant captain nemo appeared platform. saw the
 dugong, understood canadian’s attitude, and, addressing him, said:
 
“if held harpoon just now, master land, burn your
 hand?”
 
“just so, sir.”
 
“and sorry go back, one day, trade a
 fisherman add cetacean list have

“i not, sir.”
 
“well, can try.”
 
“thank you, sir,” said ned land, eyes flaming.
 
“only,” continued captain, “i advise sake to

“is dugong dangerous attack?” asked, spite the
 canadian’s shrug shoulders.
 
“yes,” replied captain; “sometimes animal turns upon its
 assailants overturns boat. master land danger is
 feared. eye prompt, arm sure.”
 
moment seven men crew, mute immovable ever,
 mounted platform. one carried harpoon line similar those
 employed catching whales. pinnace lifted bridge,
 pulled socket, let sea. six oarsmen took
 seats, coxswain went tiller. ned, conseil, i
 went back boat.

six o’clock _nautilus_, sometimes floating, sometimes immersed,

next day, 12th february, dawn day, _nautilus_
 rose surface. hastened platform. three miles the

 me.
 
“well, sir naturalist,” said canadian, slightly jovial tone,
 “and mediterranean?”
 
“we floating surface, friend ned.”
 
“what!” said conseil, “this night.”
 
“yes, night; minutes passed impassable
 isthmus.”
 
“i believe it,” replied canadian.
 
“then wrong, master land,” continued; “this low coast which
 rounds south egyptian coast. such
 good eyes, ned, can see jetty port said stretching the

canadian looked attentively.
 
“certainly right, sir, captain first-rate man. we
 mediterranean. good! now, please, let us talk our
 little affair, one hears us.”
 
saw canadian wanted, and, case, thought better
 let talk, wished it; three went sat down
 near lantern, less exposed spray the

“now, ned, listen; tell us?”
 
“what tell simple. europe; before
 captain nemo’s caprices drag us bottom polar

“friend ned, answer frankly, tired board? are

canadian remained moments without answering. then, crossing
 arms, said:
 
“frankly, regret journey seas. shall glad

“it will come end, ned.”
 
“where when?”
 
“where know—when say; or, rather, suppose will
 end seas nothing teach us.”
 
“then hope for?” demanded canadian.
 
“that circumstances may occur well six months hence now which
 may profit.”
 
“oh!” said ned land, “and shall six months, you
 please, sir naturalist?”
 
“perhaps china; know _nautilus_ rapid traveller. it
 goes water swallows air, express the
 land. fear frequented seas; can say may not
 beat coasts france, england, america, flight may be
 attempted advantageously here.”
 
“m. aronnax,” replied canadian, “your arguments rotten the
 foundation. speak future, ‘we shall there! shall be
 here!’ speak present, ‘we here, must profit by
 it.’”
 
ned land’s logic pressed hard, felt beaten that
 ground. knew argument now tell favour.
 
“sir,” continued ned, “let us suppose impossibility: captain nemo
 day offer liberty; accept it?”
 
“i know,” answered.
 
“and if,” added, “the offer made day never be
 renewed, accept it?”
 
“friend ned, answer. reasoning me. must
 rely captain nemo’s good-will. common prudence forbids to
 set us liberty. side, prudence bids us profit the
 first opportunity leave _nautilus_.”
 
“well, m. aronnax, wisely said.”
 
“only one observation—just one. occasion must serious, our
 first attempt must succeed; fails, shall never find another,
 captain nemo will never forgive us.”
 
“all true,” replied canadian. “but observation applies
 equally attempts flight, whether two years’ time, in
 two days’. question still this: favourable opportunity
 presents itself, must seized.”
 
“agreed! now, ned, will tell mean favourable
 opportunity?”
 
“it will which, dark night, will bring _nautilus_ a
 short distance european coast.”
 
“and will try save swimming?”
 
“yes, near enough bank, vessel was

“and case?”
 
“in case, seek make master pinnace. i
 know worked. must get inside, bolts drawn, we
 shall come surface water, without even pilot, is

“well, ned, watch opportunity; forget hitch

“i will forget, sir.”
 
“and now, ned, like know think project?”
 
“certainly, m. aronnax.”
 
“well, think—i say hope—i think favourable

“why not?”
 
“because captain nemo hide given
 hope regaining liberty, will guard,
 all, seas sight european coasts.”
 
“we shall see,” replied ned land, shaking head determinedly.
 
“and now, ned land,” added, “let us stop here. another word on
 subject. day ready, come let us know, we
 will follow you. rely entirely upon you.”
 
thus ended conversation which, distant time, led such
 grave results. must say facts seemed confirm my
 foresight, canadian’s great despair. captain nemo distrust

thus knew near island carpathos, one the

“est carpathio neptuni gurgite vates,

indeed ancient abode proteus, old shepherd of
 neptune’s flocks, now island scarpanto, situated rhodes

next day, 14th february, resolved employ hours in
 studying fishes archipelago; reason other
 panels remained hermetically sealed. upon taking course the
 _nautilus_, found going towards candia, ancient isle

made allusion event night found alone

 preoccupied. then, contrary custom, ordered panels be
 opened, and, going one other, observed mass waters
 attentively. end guess; so, side, employed
 time studying fish passing eyes.
 
midst waters man appeared, diver, carrying his
 belt leathern purse. body abandoned waves; was
 living man, swimming strong hand, disappearing occasionally to
 take breath surface.
 
turned towards captain nemo, agitated voice exclaimed:
 
“a man shipwrecked! must saved price!”
 

[illustration] “a man! shipwrecked sailor!” cried
 

captain answer me, came leaned panel.
 
man approached, and, face flattened glass,
 looking us.
 
great amazement, captain nemo signed him. diver answered

 appear again.
 
“do uncomfortable,” said captain nemo. “it nicholas cape

 diver! water element, lives land,
 going continually one island another, even far crete.”
 
“you know him, captain?”
 
“why not, m. aronnax?”
 
saying which, captain nemo went towards piece furniture standing
 near left panel saloon. near piece furniture, saw
 chest bound iron, cover copper plate,
 bearing cypher _nautilus_ device.
 
moment, captain, without noticing presence, opened the
 piece furniture, sort strong box, held great many
 ingots.
 
ingots gold. whence came precious metal, which
 represented enormous sum? captain gather gold

say one word. looked. captain nemo took ingots one by

 gold, say, nearly £200,000.
 
chest securely fastened, captain wrote address on
 lid, characters must belonged modern greece.
 
done, captain nemo pressed knob, wire communicated
 quarters crew. four men appeared, and, without some
 trouble, pushed chest saloon. heard hoisting

moment, captain nemo turned me.
 
“and saying, sir?” said he.
 
“i saying nothing, captain.”
 
“then, sir, will allow me, will wish good night.”
 
whereupon turned left saloon.
 
returned room much troubled, one may believe. vainly tried
 sleep—i sought connecting link apparition the
 diver chest filled gold. soon, felt certain movements
 pitching tossing _nautilus_ leaving depths and
 returning surface.
 
heard steps upon platform; knew unfastening
 pinnace launching upon waves. one instant struck
 side _nautilus_, noise ceased.
 
two hours after, noise, going coming renewed;
 boat hoisted board, replaced socket, the
 _nautilus_ plunged waves.

next day related conseil canadian events the

“but take millions to?” asked ned land.

“could fire board?” asked myself.
 
leaving saloon, captain nemo entered; approached the
 thermometer, consulted it, and, turning me, said:
 
“forty-two degrees.”
 
“i noticed it, captain,” replied; “and gets much hotter we
 bear it.”
 
“oh, sir, will get better wish it.”
 
“you can reduce please, then?”
 
“no; can go farther stove produces it.”
 
“it outward, then!”
 
“certainly; floating current boiling water.”
 
“is possible!” exclaimed.
 
“look.”
 
panels opened, saw entirely white round. a
 sulphurous smoke curling amid waves, boiled like water in

 great quickly took again.
 
“where we?” asked.
 
“near island santorin, sir,” replied captain. “i wished to
 give sight curious spectacle submarine eruption.”
 
“i thought,” said i, “that formation new islands was
 ended.”
 
“nothing ever ended volcanic parts sea,” replied
 captain nemo; “and globe always worked subterranean

“and canal moment?” asked.
 
“here is,” replied captain nemo, showing map the

“we can remain longer boiling water,” said captain.
 
“it prudent,” replied impassive captain nemo.

 cachalots whales
 

nights 13th 14th march, _nautilus_
 returned southerly course. fancied that, level with
 cape horn, turn helm westward, order beat the
 pacific seas, complete tour world. nothing of
 kind, continued way southern regions. was
 going to? pole? madness! began think the
 captain’s temerity justified ned land’s fears. time past the
 canadian spoken projects flight; less
 communicative, almost silent. see lengthened
 imprisonment weighing upon him, felt rage burning
 within him. met captain, eyes lit suppressed
 anger; feared natural violence lead some
 extreme. day, 14th march, conseil came my
 room. inquired cause visit.
 
“a simple question ask you, sir,” replied canadian.
 
“speak, ned.”
 
“how many men board _nautilus_, think?”
 
“i tell, friend.”
 
“i say working require large crew.”
 
“certainly, existing conditions, ten men, most, to
 enough.”
 
“well, more?”
 
“why?” replied, looking fixedly ned land, whose meaning easy
 guess. “because,” added, “if surmises correct, i
 well understood captain’s existence, _nautilus_ not
 vessel: also place refuge who, like its
 commander, broken every tie upon earth.”
 
“perhaps so,” said conseil; “but, case, _nautilus_ can only
 contain certain number men. you, sir, estimate their
 maximum?”
 
“how, conseil?”
 
“by calculation; given size vessel, know, sir, and
 consequently quantity air contains, knowing also much
 man expends breath, comparing results fact
 _nautilus_ obliged go surface every twenty-four
 hours.”
 
conseil finished sentence saw driving
 at.
 
“i understand,” said i; “but calculation, though simple enough,
 can give uncertain result.”
 
“never mind,” said ned land urgently.
 
“here is, then,” said i. “in one hour man consumes oxygen
 contained twenty gallons air; twenty-four, contained
 480 gallons. must, therefore find many times 480 gallons of
 air _nautilus_ contains.”
 
“just so,” said conseil.
 
“or,” continued, “the size _nautilus_ 1,500 tons; and
 one ton holding 200 gallons, contains 300,000 gallons air, which,
 divided 480, gives quotient 625. means say, strictly
 speaking, air contained _nautilus_ suffice for
 625 men twenty-four hours.”
 
“six hundred twenty-five!” repeated ned.
 
“but remember us, passengers, sailors, officers
 included, form tenth part number.”
 
“still many three men,” murmured conseil.
 
canadian shook head, passed hand across forehead, and
 left room without answering.
 
“will allow make one observation, sir?” said conseil. “poor
 ned longing everything can have. past life is
 always present him; everything forbidden regrets. his
 head full old recollections. must understand him. has
 here? nothing; learned like you, sir; not
 taste beauties have. risk
 everything able go tavern own
 country.”
 
certainly monotony board must seem intolerable canadian,
 accustomed life liberty activity. events were
 rare rouse show spirit; day event
 happen recalled bright days harpooner. about
 eleven morning, surface ocean, the
 _nautilus_ fell troop whales—an encounter not
 astonish me, knowing creatures, hunted death, taken
 refuge high latitudes.
 
seated platform, quiet sea. month october
 latitudes gave us lovely autumnal days. the
 canadian—he mistaken—who signalled whale eastern
 horizon. looking attentively, one might see black back rise and
 fall waves five miles _nautilus_.
 
“ah!” exclaimed ned land, “if board whaler, now a
 meeting give pleasure. one large size. see what
 strength blow-holes throw columns air steam! confound it,
 bound steel plates?”
 
“what, ned,” said i, “you forgotten old ideas of
 fishing?”
 
“can whale-fisher ever forget old trade, sir? can ever tire of
 emotions caused chase?”
 
“you never fished seas, ned?”
 
“never, sir; northern only, much behring davis
 straits.”
 
“then southern whale still unknown you. greenland
 whale hunted time, risk passing
 warm waters equator. whales localised, according
 kinds, certain seas never leave. one of
 creatures went behring davis straits, must simply
 passage one other, either the
 american asiatic side.”
 
“in case, never fished seas, know the
 kind whale frequenting them!”
 
“i told you, ned.”
 
“a greater reason making acquaintance,” said conseil.
 
“look! look!” exclaimed canadian, “they approach: aggravate
 me; know get them!”
 
ned stamped feet. hand trembled, grasped imaginary
 harpoon.
 
“are cetaceans large northern seas?” asked he.
 
“very nearly, ned.”
 
“because seen large whales, sir, whales measuring hundred
 feet. even told hullamoch umgallick, of
 aleutian islands, sometimes hundred fifty feet long.”
 
“that seems exaggeration. creatures only
 balaeaopterons, provided dorsal fins; and, like cachalots, are
 generally much smaller greenland whale.”
 
“ah!” exclaimed canadian, whose eyes never left ocean,
 “they coming nearer; water _nautilus_.”
 
then, returning conversation, said:
 
“you spoke cachalot small creature. heard of
 gigantic ones. intelligent cetacea. said that
 cover seaweed fucus, taken for
 islands. people encamp upon them, settle there; lights fire——”
 
“and build houses,” said conseil.
 
“yes, joker,” said ned land. “and one fine day creature plunges,
 carrying inhabitants bottom sea.”
 
“something like travels sinbad sailor,” replied, laughing.
 
“ah!” suddenly exclaimed ned land, “it one whale; are
 ten—there twenty—it whole troop! able do
 anything! hands feet tied!”
 
“but, friend ned,” said conseil, “why ask captain nemo’s
 permission chase them?”
 
conseil finished sentence ned land lowered himself
 panel seek captain. minutes afterwards two
 appeared together platform.
 
captain nemo watched troop cetacea playing waters a
 mile _nautilus_.
 
“they southern whales,” said he; “there goes fortune whole
 fleet whalers.”
 
“well, sir,” asked canadian, “can chase them, to
 remind old trade harpooner?”
 
“and purpose?” replied captain nemo; “only destroy! have
 nothing whale-oil board.”
 
“but, sir,” continued canadian, “in red allowed us to
 follow dugong.”
 
“then procure fresh meat crew. be
 killing killing’s sake. know privilege reserved for
 man, approve murderous pastime. destroying the
 southern whale (like greenland whale, inoffensive creature),
 traders culpable action, master land. already
 depopulated whole baffin’s bay, annihilating class of
 useful animals. leave unfortunate cetacea alone. plenty
 natural enemies—cachalots, swordfish, sawfish—without you
 troubling them.”
 
captain right. barbarous inconsiderate greed these
 fishermen will one day cause disappearance last whale the
 ocean. ned land whistled “yankee-doodle” teeth, thrust his
 hands pockets, turned back upon us. captain nemo
 watched troop cetacea, and, addressing me, said:
 
“i right saying whales natural enemies enough, without
 counting man. will plenty long. see, m.
 aronnax, eight miles leeward, blackish moving points?”
 
“yes, captain,” replied.
 
“those cachalots—terrible animals, met troops of
 two three hundred. those, cruel, mischievous
 creatures; right exterminating them.”
 
canadian turned quickly last words.
 
“well, captain,” said he, “it still time, interest the
 whales.”
 
“it useless expose one’s self, professor. _nautilus_ will
 disperse them. armed steel spur good master land’s
 harpoon, imagine.”
 
canadian put enough shrug shoulders.

 thing?
 
“wait, m. aronnax,” said captain nemo. “we will show something you
 never yet seen. pity ferocious creatures.

mouth teeth! one better describe macrocephalous
 cachalot, sometimes seventy-five feet long. its
 enormous head occupies one-third entire body. better armed than
 whale, whose upper jaw furnished whalebone, is
 supplied twenty-five large tusks, eight inches long,

_nautilus_ steadily pursuing southerly course, following
 fiftieth meridian considerable speed. wish reach the
 pole? think so, every attempt reach point had
 hitherto failed. again, season far advanced, the
 antarctic regions 13th march corresponds 13th of
 september northern regions, begin equinoctial season.
 14th march saw floating ice latitude 55°, merely pale
 bits debris twenty twenty-five feet long, forming banks over
 curled. _nautilus_ remained surface the
 ocean. ned land, fished arctic seas, familiar with
 icebergs; conseil admired first time. the
 atmosphere towards southern horizon stretched white dazzling
 band. english whalers given name “ice blink.” however
 thick clouds may be, always visible, announces the
 presence ice pack bank. accordingly, larger blocks soon
 appeared, whose brilliancy changed caprices fog. some
 masses showed green veins, long undulating lines had
 traced sulphate copper; others resembled enormous
 amethysts light shining them. reflected light
 day upon thousand crystal facets. others shaded vivid
 calcareous reflections resembled perfect town marble. we
 neared south floating islands increased in
 number importance.
 
60° lat. every pass disappeared. but, seeking carefully, captain
 nemo soon found narrow opening, boldly slipped,
 knowing, however, close behind him. thus, guided this
 clever hand, _nautilus_ passed ice precision
 quite charmed conseil; icebergs mountains, ice-fields or
 smooth plains, seeming limits, drift-ice floating
 ice-packs, plains broken up, called palchs circular, and
 streams made long strips. temperature very
 low; thermometer exposed air marked 2 deg. 3° zero,
 warmly clad fur, expense sea-bear and
 seal. interior _nautilus_, warmed regularly electric

 numerous tribes seals inhabited them; english american
 whalers, rage destruction, massacred old young;
 thus, life animation, left silence

eight o’clock morning 16th march _nautilus_,
 following fifty-fifth meridian, cut antarctic polar circle. ice
 surrounded us sides, closed horizon. captain nemo
 went one opening another, still going higher. express
 astonishment beauties new regions. ice took most
 surprising forms. grouping formed oriental town, with
 innumerable mosques minarets; fallen city thrown the
 earth, were, convulsion nature. whole aspect was
 constantly changed oblique rays sun, lost the
 greyish fog amidst hurricanes snow. detonations falls heard
 sides, great overthrows icebergs, altered whole
 landscape like diorama. often seeing exit, thought were
 definitely prisoners; but, instinct guiding slightest
 indication, captain nemo discover new pass. never
 mistaken saw thin threads bluish water trickling along
 ice-fields; doubt already ventured into
 midst antarctic seas before. 16th march,
 however, ice-fields absolutely blocked road. the
 iceberg itself, yet, vast fields cemented cold. this
 obstacle stop captain nemo: hurled with
 frightful violence. _nautilus_ entered brittle mass like a
 wedge, split frightful crackings. battering ram
 ancients hurled infinite strength. ice, thrown high in
 air, fell like hail around us. power impulsion our
 apparatus made canal itself; times carried away own
 impetus, lodged ice-field, crushing weight, and
 sometimes buried beneath it, dividing simple pitching movement,
 producing large rents it. violent gales assailed us time,
 accompanied thick fogs, which, one end platform
 other, see nothing. wind blew sharply all
 parts compass, snow lay hard heaps had
 break blows pickaxe. temperature always 5
 deg. zero; every outward part _nautilus_ covered with
 ice. rigged vessel entangled blocked up
 gorges. vessel without sails, electricity motive power,
 wanting coal, alone brave high latitudes. length,
 18th march, many useless assaults, _nautilus_ was
 positively blocked. longer either streams, packs, or
 ice-fields, interminable immovable barrier, formed by
 mountains soldered together.
 
“an iceberg!” said canadian me.
 
knew ned land, well navigators had
 preceded us, inevitable obstacle. sun appearing an

 nature stern silence reigned, scarcely broken flapping the

 _nautilus_ obliged stop adventurous course amid

 means employed break ice, _nautilus_ remained immovable.

 observing situation time past, said me:
 
“well, sir, think this?”
 
“i think caught, captain.”
 

[illustration] _nautilus_ blocked up
 

“so, m. aronnax, really think _nautilus_ disengage
 itself?”
 
“with difficulty, captain; season already far advanced
 reckon breaking ice.”
 
“ah! sir,” said captain nemo, ironical tone, “you will always be
 same. see nothing difficulties obstacles. affirm that
 can _nautilus_ disengage itself, also can go
 still.”
 
“further south?” asked, looking captain.
 
“yes, sir; shall go pole.”
 
“to pole!” exclaimed, unable repress gesture incredulity.
 
“yes,” replied captain, coldly, “to antarctic pole—to that
 unknown point whence springs every meridian globe. know
 whether can please _nautilus!_”
 
yes, knew that. knew man bold, even rashness. but
 conquer obstacles bristled round south pole,
 rendering inaccessible north, yet been
 reached boldest navigators—was mad enterprise, one
 maniac conceived? came head to
 ask captain nemo ever discovered pole never
 yet trodden human creature?
 
“no, sir,” replied; “but will discover together. others
 failed, will fail. never yet led _nautilus_ far
 southern seas; but, repeat, shall go yet.”
 
“i can well believe you, captain,” said i, slightly ironical tone.
 “i believe you! let us go ahead! obstacles us! let us
 smash iceberg! let us blow up; and, resists, let us give
 _nautilus_ wings fly it!”
 
“over it, sir!” said captain nemo, quietly; “no, it, under
 it!”
 
“under it!” exclaimed, sudden idea captain’s projects
 flashing upon mind. understood; wonderful qualities the
 _nautilus_ going serve us superhuman enterprise.
 
“i see beginning understand one another, sir,” said the
 captain, half smiling. “you begin see possibility—i say
 success—of attempt. impossible ordinary
 vessel easy _nautilus_. continent lies pole,
 must stop continent; if, contrary, pole is
 washed open sea, will go even pole.”
 
“certainly,” said i, carried away captain’s reasoning; “if the
 surface solidified ice, lower depths free
 providential law placed maximum density the
 waters ocean one degree higher freezing-point; and, am
 mistaken, portion iceberg water is
 one four below.”
 
“very nearly, sir; one foot iceberg are

“nothing, sir.”
 
“it even seek greater depths uniform temperature of
 sea-water, brave impunity thirty forty degrees of
 surface cold.”
 
“just so, sir—just so,” replied, getting animated.
 
“the difficulty,” continued captain nemo, “is remaining
 several days without renewing provision air.”
 
“is all? _nautilus_ vast reservoirs; can fill them, and
 will supply us oxygen want.”
 
“well thought of, m. aronnax,” replied captain, smiling. “but, not
 wishing accuse rashness, will first give my
 objections.”
 
“have make?”
 
“only one. possible, exists south pole, it
 may covered; and, consequently, shall unable come the
 surface.”
 
“good, sir! forget _nautilus_ armed a
 powerful spur, send diagonally fields
 ice, open shocks.”
 
“ah! sir, full ideas to-day.”
 
“besides, captain,” added, enthusiastically, “why find
 open south pole well north? frozen
 poles earth coincide, either southern the
 northern regions; and, proved contrary, may
 suppose either continent ocean free ice two
 points globe.”
 
“i think too, m. aronnax,” replied captain nemo. “i wish to
 observe that, made many objections project, you
 now crushing arguments favour!”
 
preparations audacious attempt now began. powerful
 pumps _nautilus_ working air reservoirs and
 storing high pressure. four o’clock, captain nemo announced
 closing panels platform. threw one last look the
 massive iceberg going cross. weather clear,
 atmosphere pure enough, cold great, 12° zero;
 but, wind gone down, temperature unbearable.

“we shall pass it, please, sir,” said conseil.
 
“i believe shall,” said, tone firm conviction.

“what matter?” said i, once.
 
“i came ask you, sir,” replied conseil.
 
“confound it!” exclaimed canadian, “i know well enough! the

“but,” asked, “has least come surface sea?”
 
“we know,” said conseil.
 
“it easy decide,” answered. consulted manometer. my

“no, sir; accident time.”
 
“serious?”
 
“perhaps.”
 
“is danger immediate?”
 
“no.”
 
“the _nautilus_ stranded?”
 
“yes.”
 
“and happened—how?”
 
“from caprice nature, ignorance man. mistake
 made working. prevent equilibrium from

captain nemo chosen strange moment uttering this
 philosophical reflection. whole, answer helped little.
 
“may ask, sir, cause accident?”
 
“an enormous block ice, whole mountain, turned over,” he
 replied. “when icebergs undermined base warmer water or
 reiterated shocks centre gravity rises, whole thing
 turns over. happened; one blocks, fell,

“but can get _nautilus_ emptying reservoirs, that

“that, sir, done moment. can hear pump

indeed, _nautilus_ still held position starboard;

“we going backwards?” said conseil.
 
“yes,” replied. “this end tunnel can egress.”

“it will hindrance,” said ned.
 
“what matter, hours less, provided get at

“yes,” repeated ned land, “provided get last!”
 
short time walked saloon library. companions

 countenance resumed habitual imperturbability.
 
“gentlemen,” said calmly, “there two ways dying the
 circumstances placed.” (this puzzling person the
 air mathematical professor lecturing pupils.) “the first is
 crushed; second die suffocation. speak of
 possibility dying hunger, supply provisions the
 _nautilus_ will certainly last longer shall. let us, then,
 calculate chances.”
 
“as suffocation, captain,” replied, “that feared,
 reservoirs full.”
 
“just so; will yield two days’ supply air. now, for
 thirty-six hours hidden water, already the
 heavy atmosphere _nautilus_ requires renewal. forty-eight
 hours reserve will exhausted.”
 
“well, captain, can delivered forty-eight hours?”
 
“we will attempt it, least, piercing wall surrounds us.”
 
“on side?”
 
“sound will tell us. going run _nautilus_ aground the
 lower bank, men will attack iceberg side is
 least thick.”
 
captain nemo went out. soon discovered hissing noise the
 water entering reservoirs. _nautilus_ sank slowly, and
 rested ice depth 350 yards, depth lower
 bank immersed.
 
“my friends,” said, “our situation serious, rely your
 courage energy.”
 
“sir,” replied canadian, “i ready anything general
 safety.”
 
“good! ned,” held hand canadian.
 
“i will add,” continued, “that, handy pickaxe as
 harpoon, can useful captain, can command my
 services.”
 
“he will refuse help. come, ned!”
 
led room crew _nautilus_ putting on
 cork-jackets. told captain ned’s proposal, he
 accepted. canadian put sea-costume, ready soon as
 companions. ned dressed, re-entered drawing-room,
 panes glass open, and, posted near conseil, i
 examined ambient beds supported _nautilus_. instants
 after, saw dozen crew set foot bank ice, and
 among ned land, easily known stature. captain nemo with
 them. proceeding dig walls, took soundings, be
 sure working right direction. long sounding lines sunk
 side walls, fifteen yards stopped by
 thick wall. useless attack ceiling-like
 surface, since iceberg measured 400 yards in
 height. captain nemo sounded lower surface. ten yards of
 wall separated us water, great thickness the
 ice-field. necessary, therefore, cut piece equal in
 extent waterline _nautilus_. 6,000 cubic
 yards detach, dig hole descend the
 ice-field. work begun immediately carried with
 indefatigable energy. instead digging round _nautilus_ which
 involved greater difficulty, captain nemo immense
 trench made eight yards port-quarter. men set to
 work simultaneously screws several points its
 circumference. presently pickaxe attacked compact matter
 vigorously, large blocks detached mass. curious
 effect specific gravity, blocks, lighter water, fled, so
 speak, vault tunnel, increased thickness at
 top proportion diminished base. mattered
 little, long lower part grew thinner. two hours’ hard
 work, ned land came exhausted. comrades replaced by
 new workers, conseil joined. second lieutenant the
 _nautilus_ superintended us. water seemed singularly cold, i
 soon got warm handling pickaxe. movements free enough,
 although made pressure thirty atmospheres. i
 re-entered, working two hours, take food rest, i
 found perceptible difference pure fluid the
 rouquayrol engine supplied atmosphere _nautilus_,
 already charged carbonic acid. air renewed for
 forty-eight hours, vivifying qualities considerably
 enfeebled. however, lapse twelve hours, raised a
 block ice one yard thick, marked surface, 600
 cubic yards! reckoning took twelve hours accomplish this
 much take five nights four days bring enterprise
 satisfactory conclusion. five nights four days! have
 air enough two days reservoirs! “without taking into
 account,” said ned, “that, even get infernal prison,
 shall also imprisoned iceberg, shut all
 possible communication atmosphere.” true enough! could
 foresee minimum time necessary deliverance? we
 might suffocated _nautilus_ regain surface of
 waves? destined perish ice-tomb, those
 enclosed? situation terrible. everyone looked the
 danger face, determined duty last.
 
expected, night new block yard square carried
 away, still sank immense hollow. morning
 when, dressed cork-jacket, traversed slushy mass a
 temperature six seven degrees zero, remarked the
 side walls gradually closing in. beds water farthest from
 trench, warmed men’s work, showed tendency

 become chances safety, hinder the

tell companions new danger. good of

 went board again, told captain nemo grave
 complication.
 
“i know it,” said, calm tone counteract most
 terrible apprehensions. “it one danger more; see way of
 escaping it; chance safety go quicker than
 solidification. must beforehand it, all.”
 
day several hours used pickaxe vigorously. work
 kept up. besides, work quit _nautilus_, breathe
 directly pure air drawn reservoirs, supplied our
 apparatus, quit impoverished vitiated atmosphere.
 towards evening trench dug one yard deeper. returned on
 board, nearly suffocated carbonic acid air

 deleterious gas. plenty oxygen; water contained a
 considerable quantity, dissolving powerful piles, it
 restore vivifying fluid. thought well it; of
 good that, since carbonic acid produced respiration
 invaded every part vessel? absorb it, necessary to

 substance wanting board, nothing replace it. on
 evening, captain nemo open taps reservoirs,

 precaution get rid sense suffocation. next

 evident meet _nautilus_ able to
 disengage itself. despair seized instant; pickaxe nearly
 fell hands. good digging must be
 suffocated, crushed water turning stone?—a
 punishment ferocity savages even have
 invented! just captain nemo passed near me. touched hand and
 showed walls prison. wall port advanced at
 least four yards hull _nautilus_. captain
 understood me, signed follow him. went board. took
 cork-jacket accompanied drawing-room.
 
“m. aronnax, must attempt desperate means, shall be
 sealed solidified water cement.”
 
“yes; done?”
 
“ah! _nautilus_ strong enough bear pressure without
 crushed!”
 
“well?” asked, catching captain’s idea.
 
“do understand,” replied, “that congelation water
 will help us? see solidification, burst
 field ice imprisons us, as, freezes, it
 bursts hardest stones? perceive an
 agent safety instead destruction?”
 
“yes, captain, perhaps. but, whatever resistance crushing the
 _nautilus_ possesses, support terrible pressure, and
 flattened like iron plate.”
 
“i know it, sir. therefore must reckon aid nature, but
 exertions. must stop solidification. will
 side walls pressed together; ten feet water
 behind _nautilus_. congelation gains us all
 sides.”
 
“how long will air reservoirs last us breathe on
 board?”
 
captain looked face. “after to-morrow will empty!”
 
cold sweat came me. however, astonished at
 answer? march 22, _nautilus_ open polar seas. we

 left respirable air must kept workers. even
 now, write, recollection still vivid involuntary
 terror seizes lungs seem without air. meanwhile,
 captain nemo reflected silently, evidently idea struck him;
 seemed reject it. last, words escaped lips:
 
“boiling water!” muttered.
 
“boiling water?” cried.
 
“yes, sir. enclosed space relatively confined.
 jets boiling water, constantly injected pumps,
 raise temperature part stay congelation?”
 
“let us try it,” said resolutely.
 
“let us try it, professor.”
 
thermometer stood 7° outside. captain nemo took the
 galleys, vast distillatory machines stood furnished the
 drinkable water evaporation. filled water, all
 electric heat piles thrown worms bathed in
 liquid. minutes water reached 100°. directed
 towards pumps, fresh water replaced proportion. the
 heat developed troughs cold water, drawn from
 gone machines, came boiling into
 body pump. injection begun, three hours after
 thermometer marked 6° zero outside. one degree gained.
 two hours later thermometer marked 4°.
 
“we shall succeed,” said captain, anxiously
 watched result operation.
 
“i think,” answered, “that shall crushed. more
 suffocation fear.”
 
night temperature water rose 1° zero.
 injections carry higher point. but, the
 congelation sea-water produces least 2°, least
 reassured dangers solidification.
 
next day, march 27th, six yards ice cleared, twelve
 feet remaining cleared away. yet forty-eight
 hours’ work. air renewed interior the
 _nautilus_. day make worse. intolerable weight
 oppressed me. towards three o’clock evening feeling rose to
 violent degree. yawns dislocated jaws. lungs panted they
 inhaled burning fluid, became rarefied more. a
 moral torpor took hold me. powerless, almost unconscious. my

 land said, reason come end. could
 hope nothing captain _nautilus_, from

 rose high submarine cliffs covered large weeds. about
 eleven o’clock ned land drew attention formidable
 pricking, like sting ant, produced means of
 large seaweeds.
 
“well,” said, “these proper caverns poulps, not
 astonished see monsters.”
 
“what!” said conseil; “cuttlefish, real cuttlefish cephalopod
 class?”
 
“no,” said, “poulps huge dimensions.”
 
“i will never believe animals exist,” said ned.
 
“well,” said conseil, serious air world, “i
 remember perfectly seen large vessel drawn waves by
 octopus’s arm.”
 
“you saw that?” said canadian.
 
“yes, ned.”
 
“with eyes?”
 
“with eyes.”
 
“where, pray, might be?”
 
“at st. malo,” answered conseil.
 
“in port?” said ned, ironically.
 
“no; church,” replied conseil.
 
“in church!” cried canadian.
 
“yes; friend ned. picture representing poulp question.”
 
“good!” said ned land, bursting laughing.
 
“he quite right,” said. “i heard picture; the
 subject represented taken legend, know think

 question monsters, imagination apt run wild. is
 supposed poulps can draw vessels, certain

“but much true stories?” asked conseil.
 
“nothing, friends; least passes limit truth
 get fable legend. nevertheless, must ground for
 imagination story-tellers. one deny poulps and
 cuttlefish exist large species, inferior, however, the
 cetaceans. aristotle stated dimensions cuttlefish five

 feet long. suffice make formidable monster.”
 
“do fish days?” asked ned.
 
“if fish them, sailors see least. one my
 friends, captain paul bos havre, often affirmed met one
 monsters colossal dimensions indian seas. the
 astonishing fact, permit denial the
 existence gigantic animals, happened years ago, 1861.”
 
“what fact?” asked ned land.
 
“this it. 1861, north-east teneriffe, nearly in
 latitude now, crew despatch-boat alector
 perceived monstrous cuttlefish swimming waters. captain
 bouguer went near animal, attacked harpoon guns,
 without much success, balls harpoons glided soft

 slip-knot round body mollusc. noose slipped far as
 tail fins stopped. tried haul board,

 separated tail body, and, deprived ornament, he
 disappeared water.”
 
“indeed! fact?”
 
“an indisputable fact, good ned. proposed name poulp
 ‘bouguer’s cuttlefish.’”
 
“what length it?” asked canadian.
 
“did measure six yards?” said conseil, who, posted the
 window, examining irregular windings cliff.
 
“precisely,” replied.
 
“its head,” rejoined conseil, “was crowned eight tentacles,
 beat water like nest serpents?”
 
“precisely.”
 
“had eyes, placed back head, considerable

“yes, conseil.”
 
“and mouth like parrot’s beak?”
 
“exactly, conseil.”
 
“very well! offence master,” replied, quietly; “if not

“what horrible beast!” cried.

“perhaps alector saw,” said conseil.
 
“no,” replied canadian; “for whole, lost

“that reason,” replied. “the arms tails animals

 noticing speaking us, went panel, looked poulps,
 said something lieutenant. latter went out. soon the
 panels shut. ceiling lighted. went towards captain.
 
“a curious collection poulps?” said.
 
“yes, indeed, mr. naturalist,” replied; “and going fight

looked him. thought heard aright.
 
“man beast?” repeated.
 
“yes, sir. screw stopped. think horny jaws one of

“what going do?”
 
“rise surface, slaughter vermin.”
 
“a difficult enterprise.”
 
“yes, indeed. electric bullets powerless soft

“and harpoon, sir,” said canadian, “if refuse my

“i will accept it, master land.”
 
“we will follow you,” said, and, following captain nemo, went

said captain nemo wept watching waves; grief
 great. second companion lost since arrival on

 dreadful arms poulp, pounded iron jaws, rest with

“master,” said day me, “this must come end. must
 make clean breast it. nemo leaving land going to
 north. declare enough south
 pole, will follow north.”
 
“what done, ned, since flight impracticable just now?”
 
“we must speak captain,” said he; “you said nothing were

 temper became surly. knew must suffer, was
 seized home-sickness myself. nearly seven months passed
 without news land; captain nemo’s isolation,
 altered spirits, especially since fight poulps, his
 taciturnity, made view things different light.
 
“well, sir?” said ned, seeing reply.
 
“well, ned, wish ask captain nemo intentions
 concerning us?”
 
“yes, sir.”
 
“although already made known?”
 
“yes; wish settled finally. speak me, name only, you

“but seldom meet him. avoids me.”
 
“that reason go see him.”
 
went room. thence meant go captain nemo’s. it

“to speak you, captain.”
 
“but busy, sir; working. leave liberty shut

reception encouraging; determined hear and
 answer everything.
 
“sir,” said coldly, “i speak matter admits

“what that, sir?” replied, ironically. “have discovered
 something escaped me, delivered new

“captain,” said, “i can approve idea makes act
 thus. result studies must lost. means you

“never, sir!” said, hastily interrupting me.
 
“but companions ready keep manuscript store;

“at liberty?” said captain, rising.
 
“yes, sir; subject wish question you. for
 seven months board, ask to-day, the

“m. aronnax, will answer to-day seven months ago:

“you impose actual slavery upon us!”
 
“give name please.”
 
“but everywhere slave right regain liberty.”
 
“who denies right? ever tried chain an

next day, 1st june, _nautilus_ continued same

 captain nemo took sun’s altitude done day before. the
 beautiful, sky clear. eight miles east, a
 large steam vessel discerned horizon. flag fluttered

 sun passed meridian, captain nemo took sextant, and
 watched great attention. perfect rest water greatly

 knew think, near slow voice heard captain
 nemo say:
 
“at one time ship called marseillais. carried

“the avenger!” exclaimed.
 
“yes, sir, avenger! good name!” muttered captain nemo, crossing
 arms.

way describing unlooked-for scene, history the
 patriot ship, told first coldly, emotion this
 strange man pronounced last words, name avenger, the
 significance escape me, impressed deeply
 mind. eyes leave captain, who, hand
 stretched sea, watching glowing eye glorious
 wreck. perhaps never know was, whence came, or
 going to, saw man move, apart the
 _savant_. common misanthropy shut captain nemo and
 companions within _nautilus_, hatred, either monstrous or
 sublime, time never weaken. hatred still seek for
 vengeance? future soon teach that. _nautilus_ was
 rising slowly surface sea, form avenger
 disappeared degrees sight. soon slight rolling told me
 open air. moment dull boom heard. i
 looked captain. move.
 
“captain?” said i.

 canadian already there.
 
“where sound come from?” asked.
 
“it gunshot,” replied ned land.
 
looked direction vessel already seen. was
 nearing _nautilus_, see putting steam.
 within six miles us.
 
“what ship, ned?”
 
“by rigging, height lower masts,” said canadian,
 “i bet ship-of-war. may reach us; and, necessary, sink
 cursed _nautilus_.”
 
“friend ned,” replied conseil, “what harm can _nautilus?_
 can attack beneath waves? can cannonade us bottom
 sea?”
 
“tell me, ned,” said i, “can recognise country belongs
 to?”
 
canadian knitted eyebrows, dropped eyelids, screwed up
 corners eyes, moments fixed piercing look
 upon vessel.
 
“no, sir,” replied; “i tell nation belongs to, for
 shows colours. can declare man-of-war, long
 pennant flutters main mast.”
 
quarter hour watched ship steaming towards
 us. not, however, believe see _nautilus_

 submarine engine was. soon canadian informed a
 large, armoured, two-decker ram. thick black smoke pouring from
 two funnels. closely-furled sails stopped yards.
 hoisted flag mizzen-peak. distance prevented us from
 distinguishing colours pennant, floated like thin
 ribbon. advanced rapidly. captain nemo allowed approach,
 chance salvation us.
 
“sir,” said ned land, “if vessel passes within mile us i
 shall throw sea, advise the
 same.”
 
reply canadian’s suggestion, continued watching
 ship. whether english, french, american, russian, be
 sure take us reach her. presently white smoke
 burst fore part vessel; seconds after, water,
 agitated fall heavy body, splashed stern the
 _nautilus_, shortly afterwards loud explosion struck ear.
 
“what! firing us!” exclaimed.
 
“so please you, sir,” said ned, “they recognised unicorn, and
 firing us.”
 
“but,” exclaimed, “surely can see men the
 case?”
 
“it is, perhaps, that,” replied ned land, looking me.
 
whole flood light burst upon mind. doubtless knew now how
 believe stories pretended monster. doubt, board the
 _abraham lincoln_, canadian struck harpoon,
 commander farragut recognised supposed narwhal submarine
 vessel, dangerous supernatural cetacean. yes, must have
 so; every now seeking engine of
 destruction. terrible indeed! if, supposed, captain nemo employed
 _nautilus_ works vengeance. night were
 imprisoned cell, midst indian ocean, not
 attacked vessel? man buried coral cemetery, not
 victim shock caused _nautilus?_ yes, repeat it,
 must so. one part mysterious existence captain nemo had
 unveiled; and, identity recognised, least,
 nations united longer hunting chimerical
 creature, man vowed deadly hatred them. the
 formidable past rose me. instead meeting friends board the
 approaching ship, expect pitiless enemies. shot
 rattled us. struck ricochetted, losing
 distance. none touched _nautilus_. vessel
 three miles us. spite serious
 cannonade, captain nemo appear platform; but, one of
 conical projectiles struck shell _nautilus_, it
 fatal. canadian said, “sir, must we
 can get dilemma. let us signal them. will then,
 perhaps, understand honest folks.”
 
ned land took handkerchief wave air; scarcely
 displayed it, struck iron hand, fell, in
 spite great strength, upon deck.
 
“fool!” exclaimed captain, “do wish pierced spur
 _nautilus_ hurled vessel?”
 
captain nemo terrible hear; still terrible see.
 face deadly pale, spasm heart. instant it
 must ceased beat. pupils fearfully contracted. did
 speak, roared, as, body thrown forward, wrung the
 canadian’s shoulders. then, leaving him, turning ship of
 war, whose shot still raining around him, exclaimed, a
 powerful voice, “ah, ship accursed nation, know am! i
 want colours know by! look! will show you
 mine!”
 
fore part platform captain nemo unfurled black
 flag, similar one placed south pole. that
 moment shot struck shell _nautilus_ obliquely, without
 piercing it; and, rebounding near captain, lost sea. he
 shrugged shoulders; and, addressing me, said shortly, “go down, you
 companions, go down!”
 
“sir,” cried, “are going attack vessel?”
 
“sir, going sink it.”
 
“you will that?”
 
“i shall it,” replied coldly. “and advise judge me,
 sir. fate shown seen. attack has
 begun; go down.”
 
“what vessel?”
 
“you know? well! much better! nationality to
 you, least, will secret. go down!”
 
obey. fifteen sailors surrounded captain,
 looking implacable hatred vessel nearing them. one could
 feel desire vengeance animated every soul. went down
 moment another projectile struck _nautilus_, heard the
 captain exclaim:
 
“strike, mad vessel! shower useless shot! then, will not
 escape spur _nautilus_. shall
 perish! ruins mingle avenger!”
 
reached room. captain second remained the
 platform. screw set motion, _nautilus_, moving with
 speed, soon beyond reach ship’s guns. pursuit
 continued, captain nemo contented keeping his
 distance.
 
four afternoon, longer able contain my
 impatience, went central staircase. panel open, i
 ventured platform. captain still walking down
 agitated step. looking ship, five or
 six miles leeward.
 
going round like wild beast, and, drawing eastward, he
 allowed pursue. attack. perhaps still
 hesitated? wished mediate more. scarcely spoken,
 captain nemo imposed silence, saying:
 
“i law, judge! oppressed, the
 oppressor! lost loved, cherished, and
 venerated—country, wife, children, father, mother. saw all
 perish! hate there! say more!”
 
cast last look man-of-war, putting steam, and
 rejoined ned conseil.
 
“we will fly!” exclaimed.
 
“good!” said ned. “what vessel?”
 
“i know; but, whatever is, will sunk night. in
 case, better perish it, made accomplices a
 retaliation justice judge.”
 
“that opinion too,” said ned land, coolly. “let us wait for
 night.”
 
night arrived. deep silence reigned board. compass showed that
 _nautilus_ altered course. surface,
 rolling slightly. companions resolved fly vessel
 near enough either hear us see us; moon,
 full two three days, shone brightly. board
 ship, prevent blow threatened it, we
 could, least would, circumstances allow.
 several times thought _nautilus_ preparing attack; but
 captain nemo contented allowing adversary approach,
 fled it.
 
part night passed without incident. watched the
 opportunity action. spoke little, much moved.
 ned land thrown sea, forced to
 wait. according idea, _nautilus_ attack ship her
 waterline, possible, easy fly.
 
three morning, full uneasiness, mounted platform.
 captain nemo left it. standing fore part near his
 flag, slight breeze displayed head. take
 eyes vessel. intensity look seemed attract,

 tranquillity, offering orbs night the
 finest mirror ever reflect image. as
 thought deep calm elements, compared those
 passions brooding imperceptibly within _nautilus_, shuddered.
 
vessel within two miles us. ever nearing that
 phosphorescent light showed presence _nautilus_. i
 see green red lights, white lantern hanging from
 large foremast. indistinct vibration quivered its
 rigging, showing furnaces heated uttermost.
 sheaves sparks red ashes flew funnels, shining the
 atmosphere like stars.
 
remained thus six morning, without captain nemo noticing
 me. ship stood mile half us, first
 dawn day firing began afresh. moment far off
 when, _nautilus_ attacking adversary, companions myself
 ever leave man. preparing go remind
 them, second mounted platform, accompanied several
 sailors. captain nemo either see them. steps
 taken might called signal action. very
 simple. iron balustrade around platform lowered, the
 lantern pilot cages pushed within shell were
 flush deck. long surface steel cigar longer
 offered single point check manœuvres. returned the
 saloon. _nautilus_ still floated; streaks light were
 filtering liquid beds. undulations waves
 windows brightened red streaks rising sun, and
 dreadful day 2nd june dawned.
 
five o’clock, log showed speed _nautilus_ was
 slackening, knew allowing draw nearer.
 besides, reports heard distinctly, projectiles,
 labouring ambient water, extinguished strange
 hissing noise.
 
“my friends,” said i, “the moment come. one grasp hand, and
 may god protect us!”
 
ned land resolute, conseil calm, nervous knew not
 contain myself. passed library; moment i
 pushed door opening central staircase, heard upper
 panel close sharply. canadian rushed stairs, i
 stopped him. well-known hissing noise told water was
 running reservoirs, minutes _nautilus_ was
 yards beneath surface waves. understood manœuvre.
 late act. _nautilus_ wish strike the
 impenetrable cuirass, water-line, metallic
 covering longer protected it.
 
imprisoned, unwilling witnesses dreadful drama
 preparing. scarcely time reflect; taking refuge in
 room, looked without speaking. deep stupor had
 taken hold mind: thought seemed stand still. that
 painful state expectation preceding dreadful report. waited, i
 listened, every sense merged hearing! speed the
 _nautilus_ accelerated. preparing rush. whole ship
 trembled. suddenly screamed. felt shock, comparatively
 light. felt penetrating power steel spur. heard
 rattlings scrapings. _nautilus_, carried along its
 propelling power, passed mass vessel like needle
 sailcloth!
 
stand longer. mad, mind, rushed room
 saloon. captain nemo there, mute, gloomy, implacable; he
 looking port panel. large mass cast shadow the
 water; and, might lose nothing agony, _nautilus_ was
 going abyss her. ten yards saw open
 shell, water rushing noise thunder,
 double line guns netting. bridge covered
 black, agitated shadows.
 
water rising. poor creatures crowding ratlines,
 clinging masts, struggling water. human
 ant-heap overtaken sea. paralysed, stiffened anguish, my
 hair standing end, eyes wide open, panting, without breath, and
 without voice, watching! irresistible attraction glued me
 glass! suddenly explosion took place. compressed air blew
 decks, magazines caught fire. unfortunate
 vessel sank rapidly. topmast, laden victims, now
 appeared; spars, bending weight men; and, last of
 all, top mainmast. dark mass disappeared, with
 dead crew, drawn strong eddy.

turned captain nemo. terrible avenger, perfect archangel of
 hatred, still looking. over, turned room,
 opened door, entered. followed eyes. end
 wall beneath heroes, saw portrait woman, still young,
 two little children. captain nemo looked moments,
 stretched arms towards them, and, kneeling down, burst deep
 sobs.

become _nautilus?_ resist pressure of

 ocean frightful retaliations? or, stop the
 last hecatomb?
 
will waves one day carry manuscript containing the
 history life? shall ever know name man? will the
 missing vessel tell us nationality captain nemo?
 
hope so. also hope powerful vessel conquered the
 terrible gulf, _nautilus_ survived
 many vessels lost! so—if captain nemo
 still inhabits ocean, adopted country, may hatred appeased
 savage heart! may contemplation many wonders
 extinguish ever spirit vengeance! may judge disappear,

 myself? lived ten months unnatural life? the
 question asked ecclesiastes three thousand years ago, “that is

 shifting reef
 

year 1866 signalised remarkable incident, mysterious and
 puzzling phenomenon, doubtless one yet forgotten. to
 mention rumours agitated maritime population excited the
 public mind, even interior continents, seafaring men were
 particularly excited. merchants, common sailors, captains vessels,
 skippers, europe america, naval officers countries,
 governments several states two continents, were
 deeply interested matter.
 
time past, vessels met “an enormous thing,” long
 object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, infinitely
 larger rapid movements whale.
 
facts relating apparition (entered various log-books)
 agreed respects shape object creature in
 question, untiring rapidity movements, surprising power
 locomotion, peculiar life seemed endowed. if
 cetacean, surpassed size hitherto classified
 science. taking consideration mean observations made at
 divers times,—rejecting timid estimate assigned to
 object length two hundred feet, equally exaggerated
 opinions set mile width three length,—we
 might fairly conclude mysterious surpassed greatly all
 dimensions admitted ichthyologists day, existed at
 all. _did_ exist undeniable fact; and, that
 tendency disposes human mind favour marvellous, we
 can understand excitement produced entire world this
 supernatural apparition. classing list fables, the
 idea question.
 
20th july, 1866, steamer _governor higginson_, the
 calcutta burnach steam navigation company, met moving mass
 five miles east coast australia. captain baker thought at
 first presence unknown sandbank; even
 prepared determine exact position, two columns water,
 projected inexplicable object, shot hissing noise a
 hundred fifty feet air. now, unless sandbank had
 submitted intermittent eruption geyser, _governor
 higginson_ neither less aquatic mammal,
 unknown till then, threw blow-holes columns water
 mixed air vapour.
 
similar facts observed 23rd july year, in
 pacific ocean, _columbus_, west india pacific
 steam navigation company. extraordinary cetaceous creature
 transport one place another surprising
 velocity; as, interval three days, _governor higginson_
 _columbus_ observed two different points the
 chart, separated distance seven hundred nautical
 leagues.
 
fifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, _helvetia_, of
 compagnie-nationale, _shannon_, royal mail steamship
 company, sailing windward portion atlantic lying
 united states europe, respectively signalled the
 monster 42° 15′ n. lat. 60° 35′ w. long. these
 simultaneous observations thought justified in
 estimating minimum length mammal three hundred
 fifty feet, _shannon_ _helvetia_ smaller
 dimensions it, though measured three hundred feet all.
 
now largest whales, frequent parts sea
 round aleutian, kulammak, umgullich islands, never
 exceeded length sixty yards, attain that.
 
reports arriving one other, fresh observations
 made board transatlantic ship _pereire_, collision which
 occurred _etna_ inman line monster, a
 _procès verbal_ directed officers french frigate
 _normandie_, accurate survey made staff commodore
 fitz-james board _lord clyde_, greatly influenced public
 opinion. light-thinking people jested upon phenomenon, grave
 practical countries, england, america, germany, treated the
 matter seriously.
 
every place great resort monster fashion. sang
 cafés, ridiculed papers, represented on
 stage. kinds stories circulated regarding it. there
 appeared papers caricatures every gigantic imaginary
 creature, white whale, terrible “moby dick” hyperborean
 regions, immense kraken whose tentacles entangle ship of
 five hundred tons, hurry abyss ocean. the
 legends ancient times even resuscitated, opinions of
 aristotle pliny revived, admitted existence these
 monsters, well norwegian tales bishop pontoppidan, the
 accounts paul heggede, and, last all, reports mr.
 harrington (whose good faith one suspect), affirmed that,
 board _castillan_, 1857, seen enormous
 serpent, never time frequented seas but
 ancient “_constitutionnel_.”
 
burst forth interminable controversy credulous and
 incredulous societies savants scientific
 journals. “the question monster” inflamed minds. editors of
 scientific journals, quarrelling believers supernatural,
 spilled seas ink memorable campaign, even drawing
 blood; for, sea-serpent came direct personalities.
 
six months war waged various fortune leading
 articles geographical institution brazil, royal academy
 science berlin, british association, smithsonian
 institution washington, discussions “indian
 archipelago,” cosmos abbé moigno, mittheilungen of
 petermann, scientific chronicles great journals france
 countries. cheaper journals replied keenly with
 inexhaustible zest. satirical writers parodied remark of
 linnæus, quoted adversaries monster, maintaining “that
 nature make fools,” adjured contemporaries to
 give lie nature, admitting existence krakens,
 sea-serpents, “moby dicks,” lucubrations delirious
 sailors. length article well-known satirical journal a
 favourite contributor, chief staff, settled monster,
 like hippolytus, giving death-blow amidst universal burst of
 laughter. wit conquered science.
 
first months year 1867 question seemed buried,
 never revive, new facts brought public. was
 longer scientific problem solved, real danger
 seriously avoided. question took quite another shape. the
 monster became small island, rock, reef, reef indefinite
 shifting proportions.
 
5th march, 1867, _moravian_, montreal ocean

accident happened five o’clock morning, day was

 surface violently agitated. bearings the
 place taken exactly, _moravian_ continued route
 without apparent damage. struck submerged rock, an
 enormous wreck? tell; examination ship’s
 bottom undergoing repairs, found part keel was
 broken.
 
fact, grave itself, might perhaps forgotten like
 many others if, three weeks after, re-enacted under
 similar circumstances. but, thanks nationality victim of
 shock, thanks reputation company vessel
 belonged, circumstance became extensively circulated.
 
13th april, 1867, beautiful, breeze
 favourable, _scotia_, cunard company’s line, found herself

seventeen minutes past four afternoon, whilst passengers

 shipwrecks, unfortunately considerable; three
 thousand ships whose loss annually recorded lloyd’s, number
 sailing steam ships supposed totally lost, the
 absence news, amounted less two hundred!
 
now, “monster” who, justly unjustly, accused their
 disappearance, and, thanks it, communication different

period events took place, just returned a
 scientific research disagreeable territory nebraska, the
 united states. virtue office assistant professor the

 york towards end march, laden precious collection. my
 departure france fixed first days may. meanwhile, i
 occupying classifying mineralogical, botanical, and
 zoological riches, accident happened _scotia_.
 
perfectly subject question day.
 otherwise? read re-read american and
 european papers without nearer conclusion. mystery
 puzzled me. impossibility forming opinion, jumped
 one extreme other. really something could

 wound _scotia_.
 
arrival new york question height. the
 hypothesis floating island, unapproachable sandbank,
 supported minds little competent form judgment, abandoned.
 and, indeed, unless shoal machine stomach, could
 change position astonishing rapidity?
 
cause, idea floating hull enormous wreck
 given up.
 
remained two possible solutions question, which
 created two distinct parties: one side, monster
 colossal strength; other, submarine
 vessel enormous motive power.
 
last hypothesis, plausible was, stand against
 inquiries made worlds. private gentleman have
 machine command likely. where, when, was
 built? construction kept secret?
 certainly government might possess destructive machine. in
 disastrous times, ingenuity man multiplied the
 power weapons war, possible that, without knowledge of
 others, state might try work formidable engine. the
 chassepots came torpedoes, torpedoes submarine rams,
 then—the reaction. least, hope so.
 
hypothesis war machine fell declaration of
 governments. public interest question, transatlantic
 communications suffered, veracity doubted. but, how
 admit construction submarine boat escaped the
 public eye? private gentleman keep secret such
 circumstances difficult, state whose every act
 persistently watched powerful rivals, certainly impossible.
 
inquiries made england, france, russia, prussia, spain, italy,
 america, even turkey, hypothesis submarine monitor was
 definitely rejected.
 
upon arrival new york several persons honour of

 gained special reputation rather obscure branch of
 natural history. advice asked. long deny the
 reality fact, confined decided negative. soon,
 finding driven corner, obliged explain myself
 categorically. even “the honourable pierre aronnax, professor in
 museum paris,” called upon _new york herald_ to
 express definite opinion sort. something. spoke, for
 want power hold tongue. discussed question its
 forms, politically scientifically; give extract from
 carefully-studied article published number 30th
 april. ran follows:—
 
“after examining one one different hypotheses, rejecting all
 suggestions, becomes necessary admit existence a
 marine animal enormous power.
 
“the great depths ocean entirely unknown us. soundings

 conformable reason admit existence fishes, or
 cetaceans kinds, even new species, organisation

 accident sort, either fatastical capricious, brought at
 long intervals upper level ocean.
 
“if, contrary, _do_ know living kinds, must
 necessarily seek animal question amongst marine beings
 already classed; and, case, disposed admit the
 existence gigantic narwhal.
 
“the common narwhal, unicorn sea, often attains length of
 sixty feet. increase size fivefold tenfold, give strength
 proportionate size, lengthen destructive weapons, you
 obtain animal required. will proportions determined by
 officers _shannon_, instrument required the
 perforation _scotia_, power necessary pierce hull

“indeed, narwhal armed sort ivory sword, halberd,

 bodies whales, unicorn always attacks success.
 others drawn out, without trouble, bottoms of

“very well! suppose weapon six times stronger animal

 obtain shock capable producing catastrophe required.
 information, therefore, shall maintain a
 sea-unicorn colossal dimensions, armed halberd, with
 real spur, armoured frigates, ‘rams’ war, whose
 massiveness motive power possess time. thus
 may puzzling phenomenon explained, unless something
 one ever conjectured, seen, perceived, or
 experienced; just within bounds possibility.”
 
last words cowardly part; but, certain point,
 wished shelter dignity professor, give much
 cause laughter americans, laugh well laugh.
 
reserved way escape. effect, however, admitted
 existence “monster.” article warmly discussed, which
 procured high reputation. rallied round certain number of
 partisans. solution proposed gave, least, full liberty the
 imagination. human mind delights grand conceptions of
 supernatural beings. precisely best vehicle, the
 medium giants (against terrestrial
 animals, elephants rhinoceroses, nothing) can be

 feet high), strongly built, grave taciturn, occasionally violent,
 passionate contradicted. person attracted attention,
 boldness look, gave singular
 expression face.
 
calls canadian calls french; and, little
 communicative ned land was, must admit took certain
 liking me. nationality drew me, doubt. an
 opportunity talk, hear, old language of
 rabelais, still use canadian provinces. the
 harpooner’s family originally quebec, already tribe
 hardy fishermen town belonged france.
 
little little, ned land acquired taste chatting, loved
 hear recital adventures polar seas. related his
 fishing, combats, natural poetry expression; his
 recital took form epic poem, seemed listening to
 canadian homer singing iliad regions north.
 
portraying hardy companion really knew him. old
 friends now, united unchangeable friendship born and
 cemented amidst extreme dangers. ah, brave ned! ask to
 live hundred years longer, may time dwell the
 longer memory.
 
now, ned land’s opinion upon question marine
 monster? must admit believe unicorn, was
 one board share universal conviction. he
 even avoided subject, one day thought duty press
 upon him. one magnificent evening, 30th july—that say,
 three weeks departure—the frigate abreast cape blanc,
 thirty miles leeward coast patagonia. crossed the
 tropic capricorn, straits magellan opened less seven
 hundred miles south. eight days _abraham

seated poop, ned land chatting one thing and
 another looked mysterious sea, whose great depths up
 time inaccessible eye man. naturally led up
 conversation giant unicorn, examined various chances
 success failure expedition. but, seeing ned land let
 speak without saying much himself, pressed closely.
 
“well, ned,” said i, “is possible convinced the
 existence cetacean following? any
 particular reason incredulous?”
 
harpooner looked fixedly moments answering,
 struck broad forehead hand (a habit his), to
 collect himself, said last, “perhaps have, mr. aronnax.”
 
“but, ned, you, whaler profession, familiarised great
 marine mammalia—you, whose imagination might easily accept the
 hypothesis enormous cetaceans, _you_ last doubt
 circumstances!”
 
“that just deceives you, professor,” replied ned. “that the
 vulgar believe extraordinary comets traversing space, in
 existence antediluvian monsters heart globe, may
 well be; neither astronomer geologist believes such
 chimeras. whaler followed many cetacean, harpooned a
 great number, killed several; but, however strong well-armed
 may been, neither tails weapons have
 able even scratch iron plates steamer.”
 
“but, ned, tell ships teeth narwhal have
 pierced through.”
 
“wooden ships—that possible,” replied canadian, “but have
 never seen done; and, proof, deny whales,
 cetaceans, sea-unicorns ever produce effect describe.”
 
“well, ned, repeat conviction resting logic of
 facts. believe existence mammal power fully organised,
 belonging branch vertebrata, like whales, cachalots,
 dolphins, furnished horn defence great
 penetrating power.”
 
“hum!” said harpooner, shaking head air man who
 convinced.
 
“notice one thing, worthy canadian,” resumed. “if animal
 existence, inhabits depths ocean, it
 frequents strata lying miles surface water, it
 must necessarily possess organisation strength would
 defy comparison.”
 
“and powerful organisation?” demanded ned.
 
“because requires incalculable strength keep one’s self these
 strata resist pressure. listen me. let us admit the
 pressure atmosphere represented weight column of

 shorter, speaking water, density is

 many times thirty-two feet water you, many
 times body bear pressure equal atmosphere,

“i idea, mr. aronnax.”
 
“about 6500; and, reality atmospheric pressure 15
 lbs. square inch, 6500 square inches bear moment a

“without perceiving it?”
 
“without perceiving it. crushed a

“yes, understand,” replied ned, becoming attentive; “because the

“precisely, ned: 32 feet beneath surface you
 undergo pressure 97,500 lbs.; 320 feet, ten times that

“the devil!” exclaimed ned.
 
“very well, worthy harpooner, vertebrate, several hundred

“why!” exclaimed ned land, “they must made iron plates eight

“as say, ned. think destruction mass cause,

“yes—certainly—perhaps,” replied canadian, shaken figures,

“well, convinced you?”
 
“you convinced one thing, sir, that, such

“but exist, mine obstinate harpooner, explain the

chapter v
 venture
 

voyage _abraham lincoln_ long time marked no
 special incident. one circumstance happened showed the
 wonderful dexterity ned land, proved confidence might
 place him.
 
30th june, frigate spoke american whalers, we
 learned knew nothing narwhal. one them, the
 captain _monroe_, knowing ned land shipped board the
 _abraham lincoln_, begged help chasing whale in
 sight. commander farragut, desirous seeing ned land work, gave
 permission go board _monroe_. fate served our
 canadian well that, instead one whale, harpooned two a
 double blow, striking one straight heart, catching other
 minutes’ pursuit.
 
decidedly, monster ever ned land’s harpoon, i
 bet favour.
 
frigate skirted south-east coast america great
 rapidity. 3rd july opening straits of
 magellan, level cape vierges. commander farragut not
 take tortuous passage, doubled cape horn.
 
ship’s crew agreed him. certainly possible that
 might meet narwhal narrow pass. many sailors
 affirmed monster pass there, “that big
 that!”
 
6th july, three o’clock afternoon, _abraham
 lincoln_, fifteen miles south, doubled solitary island,
 lost rock extremity american continent, which
 dutch sailors gave name native town, cape horn. the
 course taken towards north-west, next day screw of
 frigate last beating waters pacific.
 
“keep eyes open!” called sailors.

 black back waves! poop vessel crowded a
 moment. cabins poured forth torrent sailors officers, each
 heaving breast troubled eye watching course the

 always phlegmatic, kept repeating calm voice:
 
“if, sir, squint much, see better!”
 
vain excitement! _abraham lincoln_ checked speed made

 soon disappeared amidst storm execration.
 
weather good. voyage accomplished the
 favourable auspices. bad season australia, the

20th july, tropic capricorn cut 105° longitude,
 27th month crossed equator 110th

 direction, scoured central waters pacific. commander
 farragut thought, reason, better remain deep

 distance marquesas sandwich islands, crossed the
 tropic cancer, made china seas. theatre

 future incurable aneurism. entire ship’s crew undergoing a
 nervous excitement, can give idea: eat,
 sleep—twenty times day, misconception optical
 illusion sailor seated taffrail, cause dreadful
 perspirations, emotions, twenty times repeated, kept us a
 state excitement violent reaction unavoidable.
 
truly, reaction soon showed itself. three months, which
 day seemed age, _abraham lincoln_ furrowed waters of
 northern pacific, running whales, making sharp deviations from
 course, veering suddenly one tack another, stopping
 suddenly, putting steam, backing ever anon risk of
 deranging machinery, one point japanese american
 coast left unexplored.
 
warmest partisans enterprise now became ardent
 detractors. reaction mounted crew captain himself, and
 certainly, resolute determination part of
 captain farragut, frigate headed due southward. this
 useless search last much longer. _abraham lincoln_ had
 nothing reproach with, done best succeed.
 never american ship’s crew shown zeal patience; its
 failure placed charge—there remained nothing but
 return.
 
represented commander. sailors hide their
 discontent, service suffered. will say mutiny
 board, reasonable period obstinacy, captain farragut
 (as columbus did) asked three days’ patience. three days the
 monster appear, man helm give three turns of
 wheel, _abraham lincoln_ make european seas.
 
promise made 2nd november. effect of
 rallying ship’s crew. ocean watched renewed attention.
 one wished last glance sum remembrance.

two days passed, steam half pressure; thousand schemes
 tried attract attention stimulate apathy the
 animal case met parts. large quantities of
 bacon trailed wake ship, great satisfaction

 round _abraham lincoln_ lay to, leave spot of
 unexplored. night 4th november arrived
 without unveiling submarine mystery.
 
next day, 5th november, twelve, delay (morally
 speaking) expire; time, commander farragut, faithful his
 promise, turn course south-east abandon ever

 standing near me, looking straight him. crew, perched in
 ratlines, examined horizon, contracted darkened by
 degrees. officers night glasses scoured growing
 darkness; sometimes ocean sparkled rays moon,
 darted two clouds, trace light lost in
 darkness.
 
looking conseil, see undergoing little the
 general influence. least thought so. perhaps first time
 nerves vibrated sentiment curiosity.
 
“come, conseil,” said i, “this last chance pocketing two
 thousand dollars.”
 
“may permitted say, sir,” replied conseil, “that never
 reckoned getting prize; and, government union
 offered hundred thousand dollars, none the
 poorer.”
 
“you right, conseil. foolish affair all, one upon

 back france six months ago.”
 
“in little room, sir,” replied conseil, “and museum, sir,

“as say, conseil. fancy shall run fair chance being

“that’s tolerably certain,” replied conseil, quietly; “i think they
 will make fun you, sir. and, must say it?”
 
“go on, good friend.”
 
“well, sir, will get deserts.”
 
“indeed!”
 
“when one honour savant are, sir, one should

cry whole ship’s crew hurried towards the
 harpooner,—commander, officers, masters, sailors, cabin boys; even the
 engineers left engines, stokers furnaces.
 
order stop given, frigate now simply went

 good canadian’s eyes were, asked managed to
 see, able see. heart beat would
 break. ned land mistaken, perceived object
 pointed to. two cables’ length _abraham lincoln_, the
 starboard quarter, seemed illuminated over. was

 elongated, centre condensed burning heat, whose
 overpowering brilliancy died successive gradations.
 
“it agglomeration phosphoric particles,” cried one the
 officers.
 
“no, sir, certainly not,” replied. “never pholades salpæ

 backwards; darting towards us!”
 
general cry rose frigate.
 
“silence!” said captain; “up helm, reverse engines.”
 
steam shut off, _abraham lincoln_, beating port,
 described semicircle.
 
“right helm, go ahead,” cried captain.
 
orders executed, frigate moved rapidly the
 burning light.

gasped breath. stupefaction fear made us dumb and

captain’s face, generally impassive, expression of
 unaccountable astonishment.
 
“mr. aronnax,” said, “i know formidable i
 deal, will imprudently risk frigate midst
 darkness. besides, attack unknown thing, defend
 one’s self it? wait daylight, scene will change.”
 
“you doubt, captain, nature animal?”
 
“no, sir; evidently gigantic narwhal, electric one.”
 
“perhaps,” added i, “one can approach gymnotus a
 torpedo.”
 
“undoubtedly,” replied captain, “if possesses dreadful
 power, terrible animal ever created. is
 why, sir, must guard.”
 
crew feet night. one thought sleep. the
 _abraham lincoln_, able struggle velocity, had
 moderated pace, sailed half speed. part, the
 narwhal, imitating frigate, let waves rock will, and
 seemed decided leave scene struggle. towards
 midnight, however, disappeared, or, use appropriate term,
 “died out” like large glow-worm. fled? one fear,
 hope. seven minutes one o’clock morning a
 deafening whistling heard, like produced body water
 rushing great violence.
 
captain, ned land, i, poop, eagerly peering
 profound darkness.
 
“ned land,” asked commander, “you often heard roaring of
 whales?”
 
“often, sir; never whales sight brought two
 thousand dollars. can approach within four harpoon lengths of
 it!”
 
“but approach it,” said commander, “i put whaler at
 disposal?”
 
“certainly, sir.”
 
“that will trifling lives men.”
 
“and mine too,” simply said harpooner.
 
towards two o’clock morning, burning light reappeared, not
 less intense, five miles windward _abraham lincoln_.
 notwithstanding distance, noise wind sea, one
 heard distinctly loud strokes animal’s tail, even its
 panting breath. seemed that, moment enormous narwhal
 come take breath surface water, air was
 engulfed lungs, like steam vast cylinders a
 machine two thousand horse-power.
 
“hum!” thought i, “a whale strength cavalry regiment
 pretty whale!”
 
_qui vive_ till daylight, prepared combat.
 fishing implements laid along hammock nettings. second
 lieutenant loaded blunderbusses, throw harpoons the
 distance mile, long duck-guns, explosive bullets, which
 inflicted mortal wounds even terrible animals. ned land
 contented sharpening harpoon—a terrible weapon his
 hands.
 
six o’clock day began break; and, first glimmer of
 light, electric light narwhal disappeared. seven o’clock
 day sufficiently advanced, thick fog obscured
 view, best spy-glasses pierce it. caused
 disappointment anger.
 
climbed mizzen-mast. officers already perched the
 mast heads. eight o’clock fog lay heavily waves, its
 thick scrolls rose little little. horizon grew wider clearer
 time. suddenly, just day before, ned land’s voice
 heard:
 
“the thing port quarter!” cried harpooner.
 
every eye turned towards point indicated. there, mile a
 half frigate, long blackish body emerged yard the
 waves. tail, violently agitated, produced considerable eddy.
 never caudal appendage beat violence. an
 immense track, dazzling whiteness, marked passage animal,
 described long curve.
 
frigate approached cetacean. examined thoroughly.
 
reports _shannon_ _helvetia_ rather
 exaggerated size, estimated length two hundred
 fifty feet. dimensions, conjecture to
 admirably proportioned. watched phenomenon, two jets of
 steam water ejected vents, rose height of
 120 feet; thus ascertained way breathing. concluded
 definitely belonged vertebrate branch, class mammalia.
 
crew waited impatiently chief’s orders. latter, after
 observed animal attentively, called engineer. the
 engineer ran him.
 
“sir,” said commander, “you steam up?”
 
“yes, sir,” answered engineer.
 
“well, make fires put steam.”
 
three hurrahs greeted order. time struggle had
 arrived. moments after, two funnels frigate vomited
 torrents black smoke, bridge quaked trembling of
 boilers.
 
_abraham lincoln_, propelled wonderful screw, went straight
 animal. latter allowed come within half cable’s
 length; then, disdaining dive, took little turn, and
 stopped short distance off.
 
pursuit lasted nearly three-quarters hour, without the
 frigate gaining two yards cetacean. quite evident at
 rate never come it.
 
“well, mr. land,” asked captain, “do advise put boats
 sea?”
 
“no, sir,” replied ned land; “because shall take beast
 easily.”
 
“what shall then?”
 
“put steam can, sir. leave, mean post
 bowsprit, get within harpooning distance, i
 shall throw harpoon.”
 
“go, ned,” said captain. “engineer, put pressure.”
 
ned land went post. fires increased, screw revolved
 forty-three times minute, steam poured valves. we
 heaved log, calculated _abraham lincoln_ going at
 rate 18½ miles hour.
 
accursed animal swam rate 18½ miles hour.
 
whole hour, frigate kept pace, without gaining six
 feet. humiliating one swiftest sailers the
 american navy. stubborn anger seized crew; sailors abused the
 monster, who, before, disdained answer them; captain no
 longer contented twisting beard—he gnawed it.
 
engineer called.
 
“you turned full steam in?”
 
“yes, sir,” replied engineer.
 
speed _abraham lincoln_ increased. masts trembled down
 stepping holes, clouds smoke hardly find way
 narrow funnels.
 
heaved log second time.
 
“well?” asked captain man wheel.
 
“nineteen miles three-tenths, sir.”
 
“clap steam.”
 
engineer obeyed. manometer showed ten degrees. cetacean
 grew warm itself, doubt; without straining itself, made
 19-3/10 miles.
 
pursuit! no, describe emotion vibrated through
 me. ned land kept post, harpoon hand. several times animal
 let us gain upon it.—“we shall catch it! shall catch it!” cried the
 canadian. just going strike, cetacean stole away
 rapidity estimated less thirty miles
 hour, even maximum speed, bullied frigate,
 going round round it. cry fury broke everyone!
 
noon advanced eight o’clock the
 morning.
 
captain decided take direct means.
 
“ah!” said he, “that animal goes quicker _abraham lincoln_.
 well! will see whether will escape conical bullets.
 send men forecastle, sir.”
 
forecastle gun immediately loaded slewed round. the
 shot passed feet cetacean, half mile off.
 
“another, right,” cried commander, “and five dollars to
 whoever will hit infernal beast.”
 
old gunner grey beard—that can see now—with steady eye and
 grave face, went gun took long aim. loud report was
 heard, mingled cheers crew.

bullet work; hit animal, fatally, and
 sliding rounded surface, lost two miles depth sea.
 
chase began again, captain, leaning towards me, said—
 
“i will pursue beast till frigate bursts up.”
 
“yes,” answered i; “and will quite right it.”
 
wished beast exhaust itself, insensible to
 fatigue like steam engine! use. hours passed,
 without showing signs exhaustion.
 
however, must said praise _abraham lincoln_, she
 struggled indefatigably. reckon distance made under
 three hundred miles unlucky day, november 6th. but
 night came on, overshadowed rough ocean.
 
now thought expedition end, never
 see extraordinary animal. mistaken. ten minutes to
 eleven evening, electric light reappeared three miles to
 windward frigate, pure, intense preceding
 night.
 
narwhal seemed motionless; perhaps, tired day’s work, it
 slept, letting float undulation waves. now a
 chance captain resolved take advantage.
 
gave orders. _abraham lincoln_ kept half steam, and
 advanced cautiously awake adversary. rare
 thing meet middle ocean whales sound asleep that
 can successfully attacked, ned land harpooned than
 one sleep. canadian went take place under
 bowsprit.
 
frigate approached noiselessly, stopped two cables’ lengths from
 animal, following track. one breathed; deep silence
 reigned bridge. hundred feet burning
 focus, light increased dazzled eyes.
 
moment, leaning forecastle bulwark, saw ned
 land grappling martingale one hand, brandishing terrible
 harpoon other, scarcely twenty feet motionless animal.
 suddenly arm straightened, harpoon thrown; heard the
 sonorous stroke weapon, seemed struck hard body.
 electric light went suddenly, two enormous waterspouts
 broke bridge frigate, rushing like torrent stem
 stern, overthrowing men, breaking lashings spars. a
 fearful shock followed, and, thrown rail without time
 stop myself, fell sea.

 unknown species whale
 

unexpected fall stunned clear recollection of
 sensations time. first drawn depth of
 twenty feet. good swimmer (though without pretending to
 rival byron edgar poe, masters art), that
 plunge lose presence mind. two vigorous strokes brought
 surface water. first care look the
 frigate. crew seen disappear? _abraham lincoln_
 veered round? captain put boat? might hope be
 saved?
 
darkness intense. caught glimpse black mass
 disappearing east, beacon lights dying distance.
 frigate! lost.
 
“help, help!” shouted, swimming towards _abraham lincoln_ in
 desperation.
 
clothes encumbered me; seemed glued body, paralysed
 movements.
 
sinking! suffocating!
 
“help!”
 
last cry. mouth filled water; struggled against
 drawn abyss. suddenly clothes seized strong
 hand, felt quickly drawn surface sea; and
 heard, yes, heard words pronounced ear—
 
“if master good lean shoulder, master would
 swim much greater ease.”
 
seized one hand faithful conseil’s arm.
 
“is you?” said i, “you?”
 
“myself,” answered conseil; “and waiting master’s orders.”
 
“that shock threw well sea?”
 
“no; master’s service, followed him.”
 
worthy fellow thought natural.
 
“and frigate?” asked.
 
“the frigate?” replied conseil, turning back; “i think that
 master better count much her.”
 
“you think so?”
 
“i say that, time threw sea, heard men
 wheel say, ‘the screw rudder broken.’”
 
“broken?”
 
“yes, broken monster’s teeth. injury _abraham
 lincoln_ sustained. bad look us—she longer
 answers helm.”
 
“then lost!”
 
“perhaps so,” calmly answered conseil. “however, still several
 hours us, one can good deal hours.”
 
conseil’s imperturbable coolness set again. swam more
 vigorously; but, cramped clothes, stuck like leaden
 weight, felt great difficulty bearing up. conseil saw this.
 
“will master let make slit?” said he; and, slipping open knife
 clothes, ripped top bottom rapidly.
 cleverly slipped me, swam us.
 
conseil, continued swim near each
 other.
 
nevertheless, situation less terrible. perhaps our
 disappearance noticed; been, frigate
 tack, without helm. conseil argued this
 supposition, laid plans accordingly. phlegmatic boy was
 perfectly self-possessed. decided that, chance of
 safety picked _abraham lincoln’s_ boats, ought
 manage wait long possible. resolved then
 husband strength, exhausted the
 time; managed: one us lay back,
 quite still, arms crossed, legs stretched out, would
 swim push front. towing business last
 ten minutes each; relieving thus, could
 swim hours, perhaps till daybreak. poor chance! hope is
 firmly rooted heart man! moreover, two us.
 indeed declare (though may seem improbable) sought destroy
 hope,—if wished despair, not.
 
collision frigate cetacean occurred about
 eleven o’clock evening before. reckoned eight
 hours swim sunrise, operation quite practicable we
 relieved other. sea, calm, favour. sometimes i
 tried pierce intense darkness dispelled the
 phosphorescence caused movements. watched luminous waves
 broke hand, whose mirror-like surface spotted with
 silvery rings. one might said bath of
 quicksilver.
 
near one o’clock morning, seized dreadful fatigue. my
 limbs stiffened strain violent cramp. conseil obliged
 keep up, preservation devolved alone. heard the
 poor boy pant; breathing became short hurried. found he
 keep much longer.
 
“leave me! leave me!” said him.
 
“leave master? never!” replied he. “i drown first.”
 
just moon appeared fringes thick cloud that
 wind driving east. surface glittered with
 rays. kindly light reanimated us. head got better again. i
 looked points horizon. saw frigate! five
 miles us, looked like dark mass, hardly discernible. no
 boats!
 
cried out. good a
 distance! swollen lips utter sounds. conseil could
 articulate words, heard repeat intervals, “help!
 help!”
 
movements suspended instant; listened. might be
 singing ear, seemed cry answered the
 cry conseil.
 
“did hear?” murmured.
 
“yes! yes!”
 
conseil gave one despairing call.
 
time mistake! human voice responded ours! it
 voice another unfortunate creature, abandoned middle of
 ocean, victim shock sustained vessel? or
 rather boat frigate, hailing us the
 darkness?
 
conseil made last effort, and, leaning shoulder, struck
 despairing effort, raised half water,
 fell back exhausted.
 
“what see?”
 
“i saw”—murmured he; “i saw—but talk—reserve strength!”
 
seen? then, know why, thought monster came
 head first time! voice! time past for
 jonahs take refuge whales’ bellies! however, conseil towing
 again. raised head sometimes, looked us, uttered a
 cry recognition, responded voice came nearer
 nearer. scarcely heard it. strength exhausted; fingers
 stiffened; hand afforded support longer; mouth,
 convulsively opening, filled salt water. cold crept me. i
 raised head last time, sank.
 
moment hard body struck me. clung it: felt i
 drawn up, brought surface water,
 chest collapsed:—i fainted.
 
certain soon came to, thanks vigorous rubbings that
 received. half opened eyes.
 
“conseil!” murmured.
 
“does master call me?” asked conseil.
 
just then, waning light moon sinking to
 horizon, saw face conseil’s i
 immediately recognised.
 
“ned!” cried.
 
“the same, sir, seeking prize!” replied canadian.
 
“were thrown shock frigate?”
 
“yes, professor; fortunate you, able find a
 footing almost directly upon floating island.”
 
“an island?”
 
“or, correctly speaking, gigantic narwhal.”
 
“explain yourself, ned!”
 
“only soon found harpoon entered skin was
 blunted.”
 
“why, ned, why?”
 
“because, professor, beast made sheet iron.”
 
canadian’s last words produced sudden revolution brain. i
 wriggled quickly top being, object, half of
 water, served us refuge. kicked it. evidently
 hard impenetrable body, soft substance forms the
 bodies great marine mammalia. hard body might bony
 carapace, like antediluvian animals; free
 class monster among amphibious reptiles, tortoises or
 alligators.
 
well, no! blackish back supported smooth, polished,
 without scales. blow produced metallic sound; incredible
 though may be, seemed, might say, made riveted
 plates.
 
doubt it! monster, natural phenomenon that
 puzzled learned world, overthrown misled the
 imagination seamen hemispheres, must owned, still
 astonishing phenomenon, inasmuch simply human
 construction.
 
time lose, however. lying upon back sort
 submarine boat, appeared (as far judge) like huge
 fish steel. ned land’s mind made point. conseil i
 agree him.
 
just bubbling began back strange thing (which was
 evidently propelled screw), began move. just
 time seize hold upper part, rose seven feet out
 water, happily speed great.
 
“as long sails horizontally,” muttered ned land, “i mind;
 takes fancy dive, give two straws my
 life.”
 
canadian might said still less. became really necessary to
 communicate beings, whatever were, shut inside the
 machine. searched outside aperture, panel, a
 man-hole, use technical expression; lines iron
 rivets, solidly driven joints iron plates, clear
 uniform. besides, moon disappeared then, left us total
 darkness.
 
last long night passed. indistinct remembrance prevents my
 describing impressions made. can recall one
 circumstance. lulls wind sea, fancied heard
 several times vague sounds, sort fugitive harmony produced by
 words command. mystery submarine craft, of
 whole world vainly sought explanation? kind beings
 existed strange boat? mechanical agent caused its
 prodigious speed?
 
daybreak appeared. morning mists surrounded us, soon
 cleared off. examine hull, formed deck a
 kind horizontal platform, felt gradually sinking.
 
“oh! confound it!” cried ned land, kicking resounding plate. “open,
 inhospitable rascals!”
 
happily sinking movement ceased. suddenly noise, like iron works
 violently pushed aside, came interior boat. one iron
 plate moved, man appeared, uttered odd cry, disappeared
 immediately.

“dinner-time! good fellow? say rather breakfast-time, we

words, ned land rose suddenly. steward, nearly strangled,
 tottered sign master; power the
 commander board, gesture betrayed resentment which
 man must felt towards canadian. conseil, interested in
 spite himself, stupefied, awaited silence result this
 scene.
 
commander, leaning corner table arms
 folded, scanned us profound attention. hesitate speak?
 regret words just spoken french? one might
 almost think so.
 
moments silence, one us dreamed breaking,
 “gentlemen,” said he, calm penetrating voice, “i speak french,
 english, german, latin equally well. could, therefore, have
 answered first interview, wished know first,

 main points, convinced identity. know now chance has

 museum paris, entrusted scientific mission abroad,

 board frigate _abraham lincoln_ navy united states of
 america.”
 
bowed assent. question commander put me.
 therefore answer made. man expressed himself
 perfect ease, without accent. sentences well turned,
 words clear, fluency speech remarkable. yet, not
 recognise fellow-countryman.
 
continued conversation terms:
 
“you doubtless thought, sir, delayed long paying
 second visit. reason that, identity recognised, i
 wished weigh maturely part act towards you. hesitated
 much. annoying circumstances brought presence of
 man broken ties humanity. come trouble
 existence.”
 
“unintentionally!” said i.
 
“unintentionally?” replied stranger, raising voice little;
 “was unintentionally _abraham lincoln_ pursued over
 seas? unintentionally took passage frigate?
 unintentionally cannon balls rebounded plating
 vessel? unintentionally mr. ned land struck with
 harpoon?”
 
detected restrained irritation words. these
 recriminations natural answer make made it.
 
“sir,” said i, “no doubt ignorant discussions have
 taken place concerning america europe. know that
 divers accidents, caused collisions submarine machine,
 excited public feeling two continents. omit the
 hypotheses without number sought explain the
 inexplicable phenomenon alone possess secret. you
 must understand that, pursuing high seas the
 pacific, _abraham lincoln_ believed chasing some
 powerful sea-monster, necessary rid ocean any
 price.”
 
half-smile curled lips commander: then, calmer tone—
 
“m. aronnax,” replied, “dare affirm frigate not
 soon pursued cannonaded submarine boat monster?”
 
question embarrassed me, certainly captain farragut might not
 hesitated. might thought duty destroy a
 contrivance kind, gigantic narwhal.
 
“you understand then, sir,” continued stranger, “that the
 right treat enemies?”
 
answered nothing, purposely. good discuss
 proposition, force destroy best arguments?
 
“i hesitated time,” continued commander; “nothing obliged
 show hospitality. chose separate you, i
 interest seeing again; place upon the
 deck vessel served refuge, sink
 beneath waters, forget ever existed. not
 right?”
 
“it might right savage,” answered, “but a
 civilised man.”
 
“professor,” replied commander, quickly, “i call a
 civilised man! done society entirely, reasons i

 sole judges answerable.
 
reflections crossed mind rapidly, whilst stranger
 personage silent, absorbed, wrapped himself. i
 regarded fear mingled interest, doubtless, Œdipus
 regarded sphinx.
 
rather long silence, commander resumed conversation.
 
“i hesitated,” said he, “but thought interest might

 will free; and, exchange liberty, shall impose

“speak, sir,” answered. “i suppose condition one man

“yes, sir; this. possible certain events, unforeseen,

things took place board which, say least, singular,

“we accept,” answered; “only will ask permission, sir, to

“speak, sir.”
 
“you said free board.”
 
“entirely.”
 
“i ask you, then, mean liberty?”
 
“just liberty go, come, see, observe even that

evident understand one another.
 
“pardon me, sir,” resumed, “but liberty every

“it must suffice you, however.”
 
“what! must renounce ever seeing country, friends, our
 relations again?”
 
“yes, sir. renounce unendurable worldly yoke men
 believe liberty, perhaps painful think.”
 
“well,” exclaimed ned land, “never will give word honour to
 try escape.”
 
“i ask word honour, master land,” answered the
 commander, coldly.
 
“sir,” replied, beginning get angry spite myself, “you abuse
 situation towards us; cruelty.”
 
“no, sir, clemency. prisoners war. keep you, when
 could, word, plunge depths ocean. you
 attacked me. came surprise secret man world

words indicated resolution taken part commander,
 arguments prevail.
 
“so, sir,” rejoined, “you give us simply choice life and
 death?”
 
“simply.”
 
“my friends,” said i, “to question thus put, nothing to
 answer. word honour binds us master vessel.”
 
“none, sir,” answered unknown.
 
then, gentler tone, continued—
 
“now, permit finish say you. know you, m.

“by name address you?”
 
“sir,” replied commander, “i nothing captain nemo;

captain nemo called. steward appeared. captain gave his
 orders strange language understand. then,
 turning towards canadian conseil—
 
“a repast awaits cabin,” said he. “be good follow

“and now, m. aronnax, breakfast ready. permit lead the

“these usual nautical instruments,” replied, “and know the
 use them. others, doubt, answer particular
 requirements _nautilus_. dial movable needle a
 manometer, not?”
 
“it actually manometer. communication water, whose
 external pressure indicates, gives depth time.”
 
“and instruments, use guess?”
 
“here, professor, give explanations. will be
 kind enough listen me?”
 
silent moments, said—
 
“there powerful agent, obedient, rapid, easy, conforms to
 every use, reigns supreme board vessel. everything done by
 means it. lights it, warms it, soul mechanical

“electricity?” cried surprise.
 
“yes, sir.”
 
“nevertheless, captain, possess extreme rapidity movement,
 agree power electricity. now, its
 dynamic force remained restraint, able to
 produce small amount power.”
 
“professor,” said captain nemo, “my electricity everybody’s. you
 know sea-water composed of. thousand grammes found 96½

 then, smaller quantity, chlorides magnesium potassium,
 bromide magnesium, sulphate magnesia, sulphate carbonate of

 electricity, electricity gives heat, light, motion, and, word,
 life _nautilus_.”
 
“but air breathe?”
 
“oh! manufacture air necessary consumption, it
 useless, go surface water please.
 however, electricity furnish air breathe, it

“exactly.”
 
“another application electricity. dial hanging front us
 indicates speed _nautilus_. electric thread puts in

 look! now spinning along uniform speed fifteen miles

“it marvelous! see, captain, right make use of

“we finished, m. aronnax,” said captain nemo, rising. “if you

“it leads small boat,” said.
 
“what! boat?” exclaimed, surprise.
 
“of course; excellent vessel, light insubmersible, serves
 either fishing pleasure boat.”
 
“but then, wish embark, obliged come the

“not all. boat attached upper part hull the

“but get back board?”
 
“i come back, m. aronnax; _nautilus_ comes me.”
 
“by orders?”
 
“by orders. electric thread connects us. telegraph it, and

“when made plans submarine vessel, meant that

“the _nautilus_ composed two hulls, one inside, other

“well, captain, now come real difficulty. can

“just so, sir.”
 
“then, unless quite fill _nautilus_, see can

“professor, must confound statics dynamics will be

“what, sir?”
 
“when 1000 feet deep, walls _nautilus_ bear a
 pressure 100 atmospheres. if, then, just now empty the
 supplementary reservoirs, lighten vessel, go the
 surface, pumps must overcome pressure 100 atmospheres, which

“bravo, captain! can steersman follow route the

“the steersman placed glazed box, raised hull

“are lenses capable resisting pressure?”
 
“perfectly. glass, breaks blow, is, nevertheless, capable of

“then cost vessel great?”
 
“m. aronnax, iron vessel costs £145 per ton. now _nautilus_

captain nemo, commander _nautilus_.
 

“a hunt!” exclaimed ned.
 
“and forests island crespo!” added conseil.
 
“oh! gentleman going _terra firma?_” replied ned land.
 
“that seems clearly indicated,” said i, reading letter

“but captain, believe me——”
 
“be kind enough listen, will see whether any

“i listen.”
 
“you know well do, professor, man can live water,

“that diving apparatus,” said i.
 
“just so, conditions man liberty; is

“and means getting free?” asked.
 
“it use rouquayrol apparatus, invented two own

“right! told you, m. aronnax, pumps _nautilus_
 allow store air considerable pressure, those
 conditions reservoir apparatus can furnish breathable air

“i objections make,” answered; “i will ask
 one thing, captain—how can light road bottom the

“with ruhmkorff apparatus, m. aronnax; one carried back,

“captain nemo, objections make crushing answers,
 dare longer doubt. forced admit rouquayrol
 ruhmkorff apparatus, must allowed reservations with

“but gun powder,” answered captain.
 
“then air-gun.”
 
“doubtless! manufacture gunpowder board,
 without either saltpetre, sulphur, charcoal?”
 
“besides,” added, “to fire water medium eight hundred and

“but air must rapidly used?”
 
“well, rouquayrol reservoir, can furnish at

“because balls sent gun ordinary balls, little

forest composed large tree-plants; moment we
 penetrated vast arcades, struck singular

herb carpeted ground, branch clothed the
 trees, either broken bent, extend horizontally; all
 stretched surface ocean. filament, ribbon,
 however thin might be, kept straight rod iron. the
 fuci llianas grew rigid perpendicular lines, due density

 truly region perpendicularity!
 
soon accustomed fantastic position, well the
 comparative darkness surrounded us. soil forest seemed
 covered sharp blocks, difficult avoid. submarine flora
 struck perfect, richer even have

 mistaken? fauna flora closely

 scarlet ceramies, whose laminaries extended edible shoots of
 fern-shaped nereocysti, grow height fifteen feet;

next morning, 18th november, quite recovered my
 fatigues day before, went platform, just as
 second lieutenant uttering daily phrase.
 
admiring magnificent aspect ocean captain nemo
 appeared. seem aware presence, began a
 series astronomical observations. then, finished, he
 went leant cage watch-light, gazed abstractedly

 lowered panel steward’s room, eaten
 fresh, others pickled.
 
fishing ended, provision air renewed, thought the
 _nautilus_ continue submarine excursion, was
 preparing return room, when, without preamble, the
 captain turned me, saying:
 
“professor, ocean gifted real life? tempers

“yes, ocean indeed circulation, promote it, creator
 caused things multiply it—caloric, salt, animalculae.”
 
captain nemo spoke thus, seemed altogether changed, aroused

“also,” added, “true existence there; can imagine the
 foundations nautical towns, clusters submarine houses, which,
 like _nautilus_, ascend every morning breathe the

captain nemo finished sentence violent gesture. then,
 addressing chase away sorrowful thought:
 
“m. aronnax,” asked, “do know depth ocean?”
 
“i know, captain, principal soundings taught us.”
 
“could tell them, can suit purpose?”
 
“these some,” replied, “that remember. mistaken, a

“well, professor,” replied captain, “we shall show better than

said this, captain nemo went towards panel, disappeared

terrible spectacle forerunner series maritime
 catastrophes _nautilus_ destined meet its

 hulls shipwrecked vessels rotting depths, and
 deeper cannons, bullets, anchors, chains, thousand other
 iron materials eaten rust. however, 11th december we
 sighted pomotou islands, old “dangerous group” bougainville,

“what! conseil; exactly paris study jardin

two days crossing coral sea, 4th january, sighted the
 papuan coasts. occasion, captain nemo informed his
 intention get indian ocean strait torres. his
 communication ended there.
 
torres straits nearly thirty-four leagues wide; are
 obstructed innumerable quantity islands, islets, breakers, and
 rocks, make navigation almost impracticable; captain
 nemo took needful precautions cross them. _nautilus_,
 floating betwixt wind water, went moderate pace. screw,
 like cetacean’s tail, beat waves slowly.
 
profiting this, two companions went deserted

 consulted attentively. round _nautilus_ dashed
 furiously. course waves, went south-east to
 north-west rate two half miles, broke coral that
 showed there.
 
“this bad sea!” remarked ned land.
 
“detestable indeed, one suit boat like the
 _nautilus_.”
 
“the captain must sure route, see pieces of
 coral keel touched slightly.”
 
indeed situation dangerous, _nautilus_ seemed slide
 like magic rocks. follow routes the
 astrolabe zelee exactly, proved fatal dumont
 d’urville. bore northwards, coasted islands murray, and
 came back south-west towards cumberland passage. thought it
 going pass by, when, going back north-west, went
 large quantity islands islets little known, towards
 island sound canal mauvais.
 
wondered captain nemo, foolishly imprudent, steer vessel
 pass dumont d’urville’s two corvettes touched; when,
 swerving again, cutting straight west, steered
 island gilboa.
 
three afternoon. tide began recede, being
 quite full. _nautilus_ approached island, still saw,
 remarkable border screw-pines. stood two
 miles distant. suddenly shock overthrew me. _nautilus_ just
 touched rock, stayed immovable, laying lightly port side.
 
rose, perceived captain nemo lieutenant the
 platform. examining situation vessel, and
 exchanging words incomprehensible dialect.
 
situated thus: two miles, starboard side, appeared
 gilboa, stretching north west like immense arm. towards the
 south east coral showed itself, left ebb. run
 aground, one seas tides middling—a sorry
 matter floating _nautilus_. however, vessel not
 suffered, keel solidly joined. but, neither
 glide move, ran risk ever fastened to
 rocks, captain nemo’s submarine vessel done
 for.
 
reflecting thus, captain, cool calm, always master
 himself, approached me.
 
“an accident?” asked.
 
“no; incident.”
 
“but incident will oblige perhaps become inhabitant
 land flee?”
 
captain nemo looked curiously, made negative gesture, as
 much say nothing force set foot terra firma
 again. said:
 
“besides, m. aronnax, _nautilus_ lost; will carry yet
 midst marvels ocean. voyage begun,
 wish deprived soon honour your
 company.”
 
“however, captain nemo,” replied, without noticing ironical turn
 phrase, “the _nautilus_ ran aground open sea. now tides
 strong pacific; and, lighten the
 _nautilus_, see will reinflated.”
 
“the tides strong pacific: right there,
 professor; torres straits one finds still difference yard
 half level high low seas. to-day 4th

said this, captain nemo, followed lieutenant, redescended

 immovable, coralline polypi already walled with
 destructible cement.
 
“well, sir?” said ned land, came departure of
 captain.
 
“well, friend ned, will wait patiently tide 9th
 instant; appears moon will goodness put it

“really?”
 
“really.”
 
“and captain going cast anchor since tide
 will suffice?” said conseil, simply.
 
canadian looked conseil, shrugged shoulders.
 
“sir, may believe tell piece iron will
 navigate neither again; fit sold

 company captain nemo.”
 
“friend ned, despair stout _nautilus_, do; and
 four days shall know hold pacific tides.
 besides, flight might possible sight english or
 provencal coast; papuan shores, another thing; it
 will time enough come extremity _nautilus_ does
 recover again, look upon grave event.”
 
“but know, least, act circumspectly? an

“in this, friend ned right,” said conseil, “and agree him.
 master obtain permission friend captain nemo put
 us land, lose habit treading the
 solid parts planet?”
 
“i can ask him, will refuse.”
 
“will master risk it?” asked conseil, “and shall know rely
 upon captain’s amiability.”
 
great surprise, captain nemo gave permission asked for,
 gave agreeably, without even exacting promise

eight o’clock, armed guns hatchets, got the
 _nautilus_. pretty calm; slight breeze blew land.
 conseil rowing, sped along quickly, ned steered the
 straight passage breakers left them. boat well
 handled, moved rapidly.
 
ned land restrain joy. like prisoner had
 escaped prison, knew necessary re-enter it.
 
“meat! going eat meat; meat!” replied. “real
 game! no, bread, indeed.”
 
“i say fish good; must abuse it; piece
 fresh venison, grilled live coals, will agreeably vary our
 ordinary course.”
 
“glutton!” said conseil, “he makes mouth water.”
 
“it remains seen,” said, “if forests full game,
 game will hunt hunter himself.”
 
“well said, m. aronnax,” replied canadian, whose teeth seemed
 sharpened like edge hatchet; “but will eat tiger—loin of
 tiger—if quadruped island.”
 
“friend ned uneasy it,” said conseil.
 
“whatever may be,” continued ned land, “every animal four paws
 without feathers, two paws without feathers, will saluted by
 first shot.”
 
“very well! master land’s imprudences beginning.”
 
“never fear, m. aronnax,” replied canadian; “i want

“captain!”

“captain!” said, touching hand.
 
shuddered, and, turning round, said, “ah! you, professor?
 well, good hunt, botanised successfully?”
 
“yes captain; unfortunately brought troop bipeds,

“what bipeds?”
 
“savages.”
 
“savages!” echoed, ironically. “so astonished, professor, at

chapter ii
 novel proposal captain nemo’s
 

28th february, noon _nautilus_ came the
 surface sea, 9° 4′ n. lat., land sight about
 eight miles westward. first thing noticed range of
 mountains two thousand feet high, shapes most
 capricious. taking bearings, knew nearing the
 island ceylon, pearl hangs lobe indian
 peninsula.
 
captain nemo second appeared moment. captain
 glanced map. turning me, said:
 
“the island ceylon, noted pearl-fisheries. like to
 visit one them, m. aronnax?”
 
“certainly, captain.”
 
“well, thing easy. though, see fisheries, shall not
 see fishermen. annual exportation yet begun. never
 mind, will give orders make gulf manaar, shall
 arrive night.”
 
captain said something second, immediately went out.
 soon _nautilus_ returned native element, manometer
 showed thirty feet deep.
 
“well, sir,” said captain nemo, “you companions shall visit
 bank manaar, chance fisherman there, we
 shall see work.”
 
“agreed, captain!”
 
“by bye, m. aronnax afraid sharks?”
 
“sharks!” exclaimed i.
 
question seemed hard one.
 
“well?” continued captain nemo.
 
“i admit, captain, yet familiar kind of
 fish.”
 
“we accustomed them,” replied captain nemo, “and time you
 will too. however, shall armed, road may able
 hunt tribe. interesting. so, till to-morrow, sir,
 early.”
 
said careless tone, captain nemo left saloon. now, you
 invited hunt bear mountains switzerland, what
 say?
 
“very well! to-morrow will go hunt bear.” asked
 hunt lion plains atlas, tiger indian
 jungles, say?
 
“ha! ha! seems going hunt tiger lion!” when
 invited hunt shark natural element, would
 perhaps reflect accepting invitation. myself, i
 passed hand forehead, stood large drops cold
 perspiration. “let us reflect,” said i, “and take time. hunting
 otters submarine forests, island crespo, will
 pass; going bottom sea, one is
 almost certain meet sharks, quite another thing! know well that
 certain countries, particularly andaman islands, negroes
 never hesitate attack dagger one hand running
 noose other; also know affront those
 creatures ever return alive. however, negro, i
 think little hesitation case ill-timed.”
 
moment conseil canadian entered, quite composed, and
 even joyous. knew awaited them.
 
“faith, sir,” said ned land, “your captain nemo—the devil take him!—has
 just made us pleasant offer.”
 
“ah!” said i, “you know?”
 
“if agreeable you, sir,” interrupted conseil, “the commander the
 _nautilus_ invited us visit magnificent ceylon fisheries
 to-morrow, company; kindly, behaved like real
 gentleman.”
 
“he said nothing more?”
 
“nothing more, sir, except already spoken this
 little walk.”
 
“sir,” said conseil, “would give us details pearl
 fishery?”
 
“as fishing itself,” asked, “or incidents, which?”
 
“on fishing,” replied canadian; “before entering upon the
 ground, well know something it.”
 
“very well; sit down, friends, will teach you.”
 
ned conseil seated ottoman, first thing
 canadian asked was:
 
“sir, pearl?”
 
“my worthy ned,” answered, “to poet, pearl tear the
 sea; orientals, drop dew solidified; ladies,
 jewel oblong shape, brilliancy mother-of-pearl
 substance, wear fingers, necks, their
 ears; chemist mixture phosphate carbonate of
 lime, little gelatine; lastly, naturalists, simply
 morbid secretion organ produces mother-of-pearl
 amongst certain bivalves.”
 
“branch molluscs,” said conseil.
 
“precisely so, learned conseil; and, amongst testacea the
 earshell, tridacnae, turbots, word, which
 secrete mother-of-pearl, is, blue, bluish, violet, white
 substance lines interior shells, capable of
 producing pearls.”
 
“mussels too?” asked canadian.
 
“yes, mussels certain waters scotland, wales, ireland, saxony,
 bohemia, france.”
 
“good! future shall pay attention,” replied canadian.
 
“but,” continued, “the particular mollusc secretes pearl is
 pearl-oyster, meleagrina margaritiferct, precious
 pintadine. pearl nothing nacreous formation, deposited in
 globular form, either adhering oyster shell, buried the

“are many pearls found oyster?” asked conseil.
 
“yes, boy. perfect casket. one oyster mentioned,
 though allow doubt it, contained less a
 hundred fifty sharks.”
 
“a hundred fifty sharks!” exclaimed ned land.
 
“did say sharks?” said hurriedly. “i meant say hundred and
 fifty pearls. sharks sense.”
 
“certainly not,” said conseil; “but will tell us now means
 extract pearls?”
 
“they proceed various ways. adhere shell, the
 fishermen often pull pincers; common way is
 lay oysters mats seaweed covers banks. thus
 die open air; end ten days a
 forward state decomposition. plunged large
 reservoirs sea-water; opened washed.”
 
“the price pearls varies according size?” asked
 conseil.
 
“not according size,” answered, “but also according to

“but,” said conseil, “is pearl-fishery dangerous?”
 
“no,” answered, quickly; “particularly certain precautions are
 taken.”
 
“what one risk calling?” said ned land, “the swallowing
 mouthfuls sea-water?”
 
“as say, ned. bye,” said i, trying take captain nemo’s
 careless tone, “are afraid sharks, brave ned?”
 
“i!” replied canadian; “a harpooner profession? trade
 make light them.”
 
“but,” said i, “it question fishing an
 iron-swivel, hoisting vessel, cutting tails
 blow chopper, ripping up, throwing heart

“then, question of——”
 
“precisely.”
 
“in water?”
 
“in water.”
 
“faith, good harpoon! know, sir, sharks are
 ill-fashioned beasts. turn bellies seize you, in
 time——”
 
ned land way saying “seize” made blood run cold.
 
“well, you, conseil, think sharks?”
 
“me!” said conseil. “i will frank, sir.”
 
“so much better,” thought i.
 
“if you, sir, mean face sharks, see faithful
 servant face you.”

next morning four o’clock awakened steward whom
 captain nemo placed service. rose hurriedly, dressed, and
 went saloon.
 
captain nemo awaiting me.
 
“m. aronnax,” said he, “are ready start?”
 
“i ready.”
 
“then please follow me.”
 
“and companions, captain?”
 
“they told waiting.”
 
“are put diver’s dresses?” asked i.
 
“not yet. allowed _nautilus_ come near this
 coast, distance manaar bank; boat is
 ready, will take us exact point disembarking, will
 save us long way. carries diving apparatus, will put

captain nemo conducted central staircase, led the
 platform. ned conseil already there, delighted idea of
 “pleasure party” preparing. five sailors the

night still dark. layers clouds covered sky, allowing
 stars seen. looked side land lay, and
 saw nothing dark line enclosing three parts horizon, from

 rather gulf, formed mainland island manaar. there,
 dark waters, stretched pintadine bank, inexhaustible
 field pearls, length twenty miles.
 
captain nemo, ned land, conseil, took places stern of
 boat. master went tiller; four companions leaned on
 oars, painter cast off, sheered off.
 
boat went towards south; oarsmen hurry. noticed
 strokes, strong water, followed every
 ten seconds, according method generally adopted navy.
 whilst craft running velocity, liquid drops
 struck dark depths waves crisply like spats melted lead.
 little billow, spreading wide, gave slight roll boat, and
 samphire reeds flapped it.

 approaching, found near him, contrary the
 canadian’s opinion, thought far off. conseil, was
 merely curiosity.
 
half-past five first tints horizon showed upper

 suddenly daylight, rapidity peculiar tropical regions,

sign anchor dropped, chain scarcely ran,

“here are, m. aronnax,” said captain nemo. “you see enclosed
 bay? here, month will assembled numerous fishing boats of
 exporters, waters divers will ransack so
 boldly. happily, bay well situated kind fishing. it
 sheltered strongest winds; never rough

answer, and, watching suspected waves, began with

“they useless,” replied. “we going great depth,

captain nemo pronounced words, turned conseil ned

one last question remained ask captain nemo.
 
“and arms?” asked i; “our guns?”
 
“guns! for? mountaineers attack bear dagger in
 hand, steel surer lead? strong blade;
 put belt, start.”
 
looked companions; armed like us, and, than
 that, ned land brandishing enormous harpoon, placed

“we going captain’s fancy takes us, master ned.”
 
“his fancy take us far, then,” said canadian. “the persian

“very well, then, will come again, master land; if, after
 persian gulf, _nautilus_ like visit red sea, the

“i need tell you, sir,” said ned land, “that red much

“but never said going back europe.”
 
“what suppose, then?”
 
“i suppose that, visiting curious coasts arabia egypt,

“well, shall penetrate atlantic yet know.
 ah! friend ned, getting tired journey sea;

“well, sir, red please you? sufficiently

“detestable, m. aronnax. greek latin historians speak

“one may see,” replied, “that historians never sailed board

“just so,” replied captain, smiling; “and respect moderns

“it true,” said i; “but fears exaggerated?”
 
“yes no, m. aronnax,” replied captain nemo, seemed know the

“willingly.”
 
“this fanciful writer pretends name given the

“but time seen nothing transparent waves and

 towns established isthmus, construction the
 suez canal; canal, however, useless vessel like the
 _nautilus_.”
 
“very likely; useful whole world,” said captain nemo. “the

“the mediterranean!” exclaimed.
 
“yes, sir; astonish you?”
 
“what astonishes think shall day after

“yes, captain, although time accustomed myself

“well, unless _nautilus_ sails dry land, passes the

“or beneath it, m. aronnax.”
 
“beneath it?”
 
“certainly,” replied captain nemo quietly. “a long time ago nature made

“what! passage exists?”
 
“yes; subterranean passage, named arabian tunnel. it
 takes us beneath suez opens gulf pelusium.”
 
“but isthmus composed nothing quick sands?”

chapter v
 arabian tunnel
 

evening, 21° 30′ n. lat., _nautilus_ floated the
 surface sea, approaching arabian coast. saw djeddah, the
 important counting-house egypt, syria, turkey, india. i
 distinguished clearly enough buildings, vessels anchored the
 quays, whose draught water obliged anchor the
 roads. sun, rather low horizon, struck full houses of
 town, bringing whiteness. outside, wooden cabins,
 made reeds, showed quarter inhabited bedouins.
 soon djeddah shut view shadows night, the
 _nautilus_ found water slightly phosphorescent.
 
next day, 10th february, sighted several ships running to
 windward. _nautilus_ returned submarine navigation; at
 noon, bearings taken, deserted, rose
 waterline.
 
accompanied ned conseil, seated platform. the
 coast eastern side looked like mass faintly printed upon a
 damp fog.
 
leaning sides pinnace, talking one thing and
 another, ned land, stretching hand towards spot the
 sea, said:
 
“do see anything there, sir?”
 
“no, ned,” replied; “but eyes, know.”
 
“look well,” said ned, “there, starboard beam, height
 lantern! see mass seems move?”
 
“certainly,” said i, close attention; “i see something like a
 long black body top water.”
 
certainly long black object mile
 us. looked like great sandbank deposited open sea. it
 gigantic dugong!
 
ned land looked eagerly. eyes shone covetousness sight
 animal. hand seemed ready harpoon it. one have
 thought awaiting moment throw and
 attack element.
 
instant captain nemo appeared platform. saw the
 dugong, understood canadian’s attitude, and, addressing him, said:
 
“if held harpoon just now, master land, burn your
 hand?”
 
“just so, sir.”
 
“and sorry go back, one day, trade a
 fisherman add cetacean list have
 already killed?”
 
“i not, sir.”
 
“well, can try.”
 
“thank you, sir,” said ned land, eyes flaming.
 
“only,” continued captain, “i advise sake to
 miss creature.”
 
“is dugong dangerous attack?” asked, spite the
 canadian’s shrug shoulders.
 
“yes,” replied captain; “sometimes animal turns upon its
 assailants overturns boat. master land danger is
 feared. eye prompt, arm sure.”
 
moment seven men crew, mute immovable ever,
 mounted platform. one carried harpoon line similar those
 employed catching whales. pinnace lifted bridge,
 pulled socket, let sea. six oarsmen took
 seats, coxswain went tiller. ned, conseil, i
 went back boat.
 
“you coming, captain?” asked.
 
“no, sir; wish good sport.”
 
boat put off, and, lifted six rowers, drew rapidly towards
 dugong, floated two miles _nautilus_.
 
arrived cables-length cetacean, speed slackened, and
 oars dipped noiselessly quiet waters. ned land, harpoon in
 hand, stood fore part boat. harpoon used striking

 ten fathoms long, extremity attached a
 small barrel which, floating, show course dugong took

stood carefully watched canadian’s adversary. dugong,
 also bears name halicore, closely resembles the
 manatee; oblong body terminated lengthened tail, its
 lateral fins perfect fingers. difference manatee
 consisted upper jaw, armed two long pointed
 teeth formed side diverging tusks.
 
dugong ned land preparing attack colossal
 dimensions; seven yards long. move, and
 seemed sleeping waves, circumstance made easier
 capture.
 
boat approached within six yards animal. oars rested on
 rowlocks. half rose. ned land, body thrown little back,
 brandished harpoon experienced hand.
 
suddenly hissing noise heard, dugong disappeared. the
 harpoon, although thrown great force; apparently struck
 water.
 
“curse it!” exclaimed canadian furiously; “i missed it!”
 
“no,” said i; “the creature wounded—look blood; your
 weapon stuck body.”
 
“my harpoon! harpoon!” cried ned land.
 
sailors rowed on, coxswain made floating barrel.
 harpoon regained, followed pursuit animal.
 
latter came now surface breathe. wound had
 weakened it, shot onwards great rapidity.
 
boat, rowed strong arms, flew track. several times it
 approached within yards, canadian ready strike,
 dugong made sudden plunge, impossible to
 reach it.
 
imagine passion excited impatient ned land! hurled the
 unfortunate creature energetic expletives english

“look out!” cried.
 
coxswain said words outlandish tongue, doubtless
 warning men keep guard.
 
dugong came within twenty feet boat, stopped, sniffed the
 air briskly large nostrils (not pierced extremity, but
 upper part muzzle). then, taking spring, threw
 upon us.
 
pinnace avoid shock, half upset, shipped least
 two tons water, emptied; but, thanks the
 coxswain, caught sideways, full front, quite
 overturned. ned land, clinging bows, belaboured the
 gigantic animal blows harpoon, creature’s teeth were

 adventure ended, canadian, still enraged
 beast, struck heart.
 
heard teeth grind iron plate, dugong disappeared,
 carrying harpoon him. barrel soon returned the

 boat came it, took tow, made straight the
 _nautilus_.
 
required tackle enormous strength hoist dugong the
 platform. weighed 10,000 lbs.
 
next day, 11th february, larder _nautilus_ enriched
 delicate game. flight sea-swallows rested the
 _nautilus_. species sterna nilotica, peculiar egypt;
 beak black, head grey pointed, eye surrounded white
 spots, back, wings, tail greyish colour, belly and
 throat white, claws red. also took dozen nile ducks, a
 wild bird high flavour, throat upper part head white
 black spots.
 
five o’clock evening sighted north cape of
 ras-mohammed. cape forms extremity arabia petraea,
 comprised gulf suez gulf acabah.
 
_nautilus_ penetrated straits jubal, leads the
 gulf suez. distinctly saw high mountain, towering the
 two gulfs ras-mohammed. mount horeb, sinai top of
 moses saw god face face.
 
six o’clock _nautilus_, sometimes floating, sometimes immersed,
 passed distance tor, situated end bay, the
 waters seemed tinted red, observation already made by
 captain nemo. night fell midst heavy silence,
 sometimes broken cries pelican night-birds, and
 noise waves breaking upon shore, chafing the
 rocks, panting far-off steamer beating waters the
 gulf noisy paddles.
 
eight nine o’clock _nautilus_ remained fathoms under
 water. according calculation must near

 straits behind us more.
 
quarter-past nine, vessel returned surface, i
 mounted platform. impatient pass captain nemo’s
 tunnel, stay one place, came breathe fresh

soon shadow saw pale light, half discoloured fog,
 shining mile us.
 
“a floating lighthouse!” said someone near me.
 
turned, saw captain.
 
“it floating light suez,” continued. “it will long

“the entrance easy?”
 
“no, sir; reason accustomed go steersman’s

captain nemo led towards central staircase; half way he
 opened door, traversed upper deck, landed pilot’s

“now,” said captain nemo, “let us try make passage.”
 
electric wires connected pilot’s cage machinery room, and
 captain communicate simultaneously his

placed port-scuttle, saw magnificent
 substructures coral, zoophytes, seaweed, fucus, agitating their
 enormous claws, stretched fissures rock.
 
quarter-past ten, captain took helm. large
 gallery, black deep, opened us. _nautilus_ went boldly

thirty-five minutes past ten, captain nemo quitted helm, and,
 turning me, said:
 
“the mediterranean!”
 
less twenty minutes, _nautilus_, carried along the
 torrent, passed isthmus suez.

 grecian archipelago
 

next day, 12th february, dawn day, _nautilus_
 rose surface. hastened platform. three miles the
 south dim outline pelusium seen. torrent carried
 us one another. seven o’clock ned conseil joined
 me.
 
“well, sir naturalist,” said canadian, slightly jovial tone,
 “and mediterranean?”
 
“we floating surface, friend ned.”
 
“what!” said conseil, “this night.”
 
“yes, night; minutes passed impassable
 isthmus.”
 
“i believe it,” replied canadian.
 
“then wrong, master land,” continued; “this low coast which
 rounds south egyptian coast. such
 good eyes, ned, can see jetty port said stretching the
 sea.”
 
canadian looked attentively.
 
“certainly right, sir, captain first-rate man. we
 mediterranean. good! now, please, let us talk our
 little affair, one hears us.”
 
saw canadian wanted, and, case, thought better
 let talk, wished it; three went sat down
 near lantern, less exposed spray the
 blades.
 
“now, ned, listen; tell us?”
 
“what tell simple. europe; before
 captain nemo’s caprices drag us bottom polar
 seas, lead us oceania, ask leave _nautilus_.”
 
wished way shackle liberty companions, i

“friend ned, answer frankly, tired board? are
 sorry destiny thrown us captain nemo’s hands?”
 
canadian remained moments without answering. then, crossing
 arms, said:
 
“frankly, regret journey seas. shall glad
 made it; but, now made, let us done it.
 idea.”
 
“it will come end, ned.”
 
“where when?”
 
“where know—when say; or, rather, suppose will
 end seas nothing teach us.”
 
“then hope for?” demanded canadian.
 
“that circumstances may occur well six months hence now which
 may profit.”
 
“oh!” said ned land, “and shall six months, you
 please, sir naturalist?”
 
“perhaps china; know _nautilus_ rapid traveller. it
 goes water swallows air, express the
 land. fear frequented seas; can say may not
 beat coasts france, england, america, flight may be
 attempted advantageously here.”
 
“m. aronnax,” replied canadian, “your arguments rotten the
 foundation. speak future, ‘we shall there! shall be
 here!’ speak present, ‘we here, must profit by
 it.’”
 
ned land’s logic pressed hard, felt beaten that
 ground. knew argument now tell favour.
 
“sir,” continued ned, “let us suppose impossibility: captain nemo
 day offer liberty; accept it?”
 
“i know,” answered.
 
“and if,” added, “the offer made day never be
 renewed, accept it?”
 
“friend ned, answer. reasoning me. must
 rely captain nemo’s good-will. common prudence forbids to
 set us liberty. side, prudence bids us profit the
 first opportunity leave _nautilus_.”
 
“well, m. aronnax, wisely said.”
 
“only one observation—just one. occasion must serious, our
 first attempt must succeed; fails, shall never find another,
 captain nemo will never forgive us.”
 
“all true,” replied canadian. “but observation applies
 equally attempts flight, whether two years’ time, in
 two days’. question still this: favourable opportunity
 presents itself, must seized.”
 
“agreed! now, ned, will tell mean favourable
 opportunity?”
 
“it will which, dark night, will bring _nautilus_ a
 short distance european coast.”
 
“and will try save swimming?”
 
“yes, near enough bank, vessel was
 floating time. bank far away, boat was
 water.”
 
“and case?”
 
“in case, seek make master pinnace. i
 know worked. must get inside, bolts drawn, we
 shall come surface water, without even pilot, is
 bows, perceiving flight.”
 
“well, ned, watch opportunity; forget hitch
 will ruin us.”
 
“i will forget, sir.”
 
“and now, ned, like know think project?”
 
“certainly, m. aronnax.”
 
“well, think—i say hope—i think favourable
 opportunity will never present itself.”
 
“why not?”
 
“because captain nemo hide given
 hope regaining liberty, will guard,
 all, seas sight european coasts.”
 
“we shall see,” replied ned land, shaking head determinedly.
 
“and now, ned land,” added, “let us stop here. another word on
 subject. day ready, come let us know, we
 will follow you. rely entirely upon you.”
 
thus ended conversation which, distant time, led such
 grave results. must say facts seemed confirm my
 foresight, canadian’s great despair. captain nemo distrust

 pilot’s cage; sometimes went great depths, for, the

thus knew near island carpathos, one the
 sporades, captain nemo reciting lines virgil:
 
“est carpathio neptuni gurgite vates,

pointed spot planisphere.
 
indeed ancient abode proteus, old shepherd of
 neptune’s flocks, now island scarpanto, situated rhodes

next day, 14th february, resolved employ hours in
 studying fishes archipelago; reason other

 _nautilus_, found going towards candia, ancient isle

made allusion event night found alone

 preoccupied. then, contrary custom, ordered panels be
 opened, and, going one other, observed mass waters
 attentively. end guess; so, side, employed
 time studying fish passing eyes.
 
midst waters man appeared, diver, carrying his
 belt leathern purse. body abandoned waves; was
 living man, swimming strong hand, disappearing occasionally to
 take breath surface.
 
turned towards captain nemo, agitated voice exclaimed:
 
“a man shipwrecked! must saved price!”
 

[illustration] “a man! shipwrecked sailor!” cried
 

captain answer me, came leaned panel.
 
man approached, and, face flattened glass,
 looking us.
 
great amazement, captain nemo signed him. diver answered

 appear again.
 
“do uncomfortable,” said captain nemo. “it nicholas cape

 diver! water element, lives land,
 going continually one island another, even far crete.”
 
“you know him, captain?”
 
“why not, m. aronnax?”
 
saying which, captain nemo went towards piece furniture standing
 near left panel saloon. near piece furniture, saw
 chest bound iron, cover copper plate,
 bearing cypher _nautilus_ device.
 
moment, captain, without noticing presence, opened the
 piece furniture, sort strong box, held great many
 ingots.
 
ingots gold. whence came precious metal, which
 represented enormous sum? captain gather gold

say one word. looked. captain nemo took ingots one by

 gold, say, nearly £200,000.
 
chest securely fastened, captain wrote address on

done, captain nemo pressed knob, wire communicated
 quarters crew. four men appeared, and, without some
 trouble, pushed chest saloon. heard hoisting
 iron staircase means pulleys.
 
moment, captain nemo turned me.
 
“and saying, sir?” said he.
 
“i saying nothing, captain.”
 
“then, sir, will allow me, will wish good night.”
 
whereupon turned left saloon.
 
returned room much troubled, one may believe. vainly tried
 sleep—i sought connecting link apparition the
 diver chest filled gold. soon, felt certain movements
 pitching tossing _nautilus_ leaving depths and
 returning surface.
 
heard steps upon platform; knew unfastening

 side _nautilus_, noise ceased.
 
two hours after, noise, going coming renewed;
 boat hoisted board, replaced socket, the
 _nautilus_ plunged waves.

next day related conseil canadian events the

continued work, temperature rose pitch be

“could fire board?” asked myself.
 
leaving saloon, captain nemo entered; approached the
 thermometer, consulted it, and, turning me, said:
 
“forty-two degrees.”
 
“i noticed it, captain,” replied; “and gets much hotter we
 bear it.”
 
“oh, sir, will get better wish it.”
 
“you can reduce please, then?”
 
“no; can go farther stove produces it.”
 
“it outward, then!”
 
“certainly; floating current boiling water.”
 
“is possible!” exclaimed.
 
“look.”
 
panels opened, saw entirely white round. a
 sulphurous smoke curling amid waves, boiled like water in
 copper. placed hand one panes glass, heat
 great quickly took again.
 
“where we?” asked.
 
“near island santorin, sir,” replied captain. “i wished to
 give sight curious spectacle submarine eruption.”
 
“i thought,” said i, “that formation new islands was
 ended.”
 
“nothing ever ended volcanic parts sea,” replied
 captain nemo; “and globe always worked subterranean

“and canal moment?” asked.
 
“here is,” replied captain nemo, showing map the

returned glass. _nautilus_ longer moving, heat
 becoming unbearable. sea, till now white, was

 cachalots whales
 

nights 13th 14th march, _nautilus_
 returned southerly course. fancied that, level with
 cape horn, turn helm westward, order beat the
 pacific seas, complete tour world. nothing of
 kind, continued way southern regions. was
 going to? pole? madness! began think the
 captain’s temerity justified ned land’s fears. time past the
 canadian spoken projects flight; less
 communicative, almost silent. see lengthened
 imprisonment weighing upon him, felt rage burning
 within him. met captain, eyes lit suppressed
 anger; feared natural violence lead some
 extreme. day, 14th march, conseil came my
 room. inquired cause visit.
 
“a simple question ask you, sir,” replied canadian.
 
“speak, ned.”
 
“how many men board _nautilus_, think?”
 
“i tell, friend.”
 
“i say working require large crew.”
 
“certainly, existing conditions, ten men, most, to
 enough.”
 
“well, more?”
 
“why?” replied, looking fixedly ned land, whose meaning easy
 guess. “because,” added, “if surmises correct, i
 well understood captain’s existence, _nautilus_ not
 vessel: also place refuge who, like its
 commander, broken every tie upon earth.”
 
“perhaps so,” said conseil; “but, case, _nautilus_ can only
 contain certain number men. you, sir, estimate their
 maximum?”
 
“how, conseil?”
 
“by calculation; given size vessel, know, sir, and
 consequently quantity air contains, knowing also much
 man expends breath, comparing results fact
 _nautilus_ obliged go surface every twenty-four
 hours.”
 
conseil finished sentence saw driving
 at.
 
“i understand,” said i; “but calculation, though simple enough,
 can give uncertain result.”
 
“never mind,” said ned land urgently.
 
“here is, then,” said i. “in one hour man consumes oxygen
 contained twenty gallons air; twenty-four, contained
 480 gallons. must, therefore find many times 480 gallons of
 air _nautilus_ contains.”
 
“just so,” said conseil.
 
“or,” continued, “the size _nautilus_ 1,500 tons; and
 one ton holding 200 gallons, contains 300,000 gallons air, which,
 divided 480, gives quotient 625. means say, strictly
 speaking, air contained _nautilus_ suffice for
 625 men twenty-four hours.”
 
“six hundred twenty-five!” repeated ned.
 
“but remember us, passengers, sailors, officers
 included, form tenth part number.”
 
“still many three men,” murmured conseil.
 
canadian shook head, passed hand across forehead, and
 left room without answering.
 
“will allow make one observation, sir?” said conseil. “poor
 ned longing everything can have. past life is
 always present him; everything forbidden regrets. his
 head full old recollections. must understand him. has
 here? nothing; learned like you, sir; not
 taste beauties have. risk
 everything able go tavern own
 country.”
 
certainly monotony board must seem intolerable canadian,
 accustomed life liberty activity. events were
 rare rouse show spirit; day event
 happen recalled bright days harpooner. about
 eleven morning, surface ocean, the
 _nautilus_ fell troop whales—an encounter not
 astonish me, knowing creatures, hunted death, taken
 refuge high latitudes.
 
seated platform, quiet sea. month october
 latitudes gave us lovely autumnal days. the
 canadian—he mistaken—who signalled whale eastern
 horizon. looking attentively, one might see black back rise and
 fall waves five miles _nautilus_.
 
“ah!” exclaimed ned land, “if board whaler, now a
 meeting give pleasure. one large size. see what
 strength blow-holes throw columns air steam! confound it,
 bound steel plates?”
 
“what, ned,” said i, “you forgotten old ideas of
 fishing?”
 
“can whale-fisher ever forget old trade, sir? can ever tire of
 emotions caused chase?”
 
“you never fished seas, ned?”
 
“never, sir; northern only, much behring davis
 straits.”
 
“then southern whale still unknown you. greenland
 whale hunted time, risk passing
 warm waters equator. whales localised, according
 kinds, certain seas never leave. one of
 creatures went behring davis straits, must simply
 passage one other, either the
 american asiatic side.”
 
“in case, never fished seas, know the
 kind whale frequenting them!”
 
“i told you, ned.”
 
“a greater reason making acquaintance,” said conseil.
 
“look! look!” exclaimed canadian, “they approach: aggravate
 me; know get them!”
 
ned stamped feet. hand trembled, grasped imaginary
 harpoon.
 
“are cetaceans large northern seas?” asked he.
 
“very nearly, ned.”
 
“because seen large whales, sir, whales measuring hundred
 feet. even told hullamoch umgallick, of
 aleutian islands, sometimes hundred fifty feet long.”
 
“that seems exaggeration. creatures only
 balaeaopterons, provided dorsal fins; and, like cachalots, are
 generally much smaller greenland whale.”
 
“ah!” exclaimed canadian, whose eyes never left ocean,
 “they coming nearer; water _nautilus_.”
 
then, returning conversation, said:
 
“you spoke cachalot small creature. heard of
 gigantic ones. intelligent cetacea. said that
 cover seaweed fucus, taken for
 islands. people encamp upon them, settle there; lights fire——”
 
“and build houses,” said conseil.
 
“yes, joker,” said ned land. “and one fine day creature plunges,
 carrying inhabitants bottom sea.”
 
“something like travels sinbad sailor,” replied, laughing.
 
“ah!” suddenly exclaimed ned land, “it one whale; are
 ten—there twenty—it whole troop! able do
 anything! hands feet tied!”
 
“but, friend ned,” said conseil, “why ask captain nemo’s
 permission chase them?”
 
conseil finished sentence ned land lowered himself
 panel seek captain. minutes afterwards two
 appeared together platform.
 
captain nemo watched troop cetacea playing waters a
 mile _nautilus_.
 
“they southern whales,” said he; “there goes fortune whole
 fleet whalers.”
 
“well, sir,” asked canadian, “can chase them, to
 remind old trade harpooner?”
 
“and purpose?” replied captain nemo; “only destroy! have
 nothing whale-oil board.”
 
“but, sir,” continued canadian, “in red allowed us to
 follow dugong.”
 
“then procure fresh meat crew. be
 killing killing’s sake. know privilege reserved for
 man, approve murderous pastime. destroying the
 southern whale (like greenland whale, inoffensive creature),
 traders culpable action, master land. already
 depopulated whole baffin’s bay, annihilating class of
 useful animals. leave unfortunate cetacea alone. plenty
 natural enemies—cachalots, swordfish, sawfish—without you
 troubling them.”
 
captain right. barbarous inconsiderate greed these
 fishermen will one day cause disappearance last whale the
 ocean. ned land whistled “yankee-doodle” teeth, thrust his
 hands pockets, turned back upon us. captain nemo
 watched troop cetacea, and, addressing me, said:
 
“i right saying whales natural enemies enough, without
 counting man. will plenty long. see, m.
 aronnax, eight miles leeward, blackish moving points?”
 
“yes, captain,” replied.
 
“those cachalots—terrible animals, met troops of
 two three hundred. those, cruel, mischievous
 creatures; right exterminating them.”
 
canadian turned quickly last words.
 
“well, captain,” said he, “it still time, interest the
 whales.”
 
“it useless expose one’s self, professor. _nautilus_ will
 disperse them. armed steel spur good master land’s
 harpoon, imagine.”
 
canadian put enough shrug shoulders.
 attack cetacea blows spur! ever heard a
 thing?
 
“wait, m. aronnax,” said captain nemo. “we will show something you
 never yet seen. pity ferocious creatures.
 nothing mouth teeth.”
 
mouth teeth! one better describe macrocephalous
 cachalot, sometimes seventy-five feet long. its
 enormous head occupies one-third entire body. better armed than
 whale, whose upper jaw furnished whalebone, is
 supplied twenty-five large tusks, eight inches long,

_nautilus_ steadily pursuing southerly course, following
 fiftieth meridian considerable speed. wish reach the
 pole? think so, every attempt reach point had
 hitherto failed. again, season far advanced, the
 antarctic regions 13th march corresponds 13th of
 september northern regions, begin equinoctial season.
 14th march saw floating ice latitude 55°, merely pale
 bits debris twenty twenty-five feet long, forming banks over
 curled. _nautilus_ remained surface the
 ocean. ned land, fished arctic seas, familiar with
 icebergs; conseil admired first time. the
 atmosphere towards southern horizon stretched white dazzling
 band. english whalers given name “ice blink.” however
 thick clouds may be, always visible, announces the
 presence ice pack bank. accordingly, larger blocks soon
 appeared, whose brilliancy changed caprices fog. some
 masses showed green veins, long undulating lines had
 traced sulphate copper; others resembled enormous
 amethysts light shining them. reflected light
 day upon thousand crystal facets. others shaded vivid
 calcareous reflections resembled perfect town marble. we
 neared south floating islands increased in
 number importance.
 
60° lat. every pass disappeared. but, seeking carefully, captain
 nemo soon found narrow opening, boldly slipped,
 knowing, however, close behind him. thus, guided this
 clever hand, _nautilus_ passed ice precision
 quite charmed conseil; icebergs mountains, ice-fields or
 smooth plains, seeming limits, drift-ice floating
 ice-packs, plains broken up, called palchs circular, and
 streams made long strips. temperature very
 low; thermometer exposed air marked 2 deg. 3° zero,
 warmly clad fur, expense sea-bear and
 seal. interior _nautilus_, warmed regularly electric
 apparatus, defied intense cold. besides, have
 necessary go yards beneath waves find more
 bearable temperature. two months earlier perpetual

 night, six months darkness these
 circumpolar regions. 15th march latitude of
 new shetland south orkney. captain told formerly
 numerous tribes seals inhabited them; english american
 whalers, rage destruction, massacred old young;
 thus, life animation, left silence

eight o’clock morning 16th march _nautilus_,
 following fifty-fifth meridian, cut antarctic polar circle. ice
 surrounded us sides, closed horizon. captain nemo
 went one opening another, still going higher. express
 astonishment beauties new regions. ice took most
 surprising forms. grouping formed oriental town, with
 innumerable mosques minarets; fallen city thrown the
 earth, were, convulsion nature. whole aspect was
 constantly changed oblique rays sun, lost the
 greyish fog amidst hurricanes snow. detonations falls heard
 sides, great overthrows icebergs, altered whole
 landscape like diorama. often seeing exit, thought were
 definitely prisoners; but, instinct guiding slightest
 indication, captain nemo discover new pass. never
 mistaken saw thin threads bluish water trickling along
 ice-fields; doubt already ventured into
 midst antarctic seas before. 16th march,
 however, ice-fields absolutely blocked road. the
 iceberg itself, yet, vast fields cemented cold. this
 obstacle stop captain nemo: hurled with
 frightful violence. _nautilus_ entered brittle mass like a
 wedge, split frightful crackings. battering ram
 ancients hurled infinite strength. ice, thrown high in
 air, fell like hail around us. power impulsion our
 apparatus made canal itself; times carried away own
 impetus, lodged ice-field, crushing weight, and
 sometimes buried beneath it, dividing simple pitching movement,
 producing large rents it. violent gales assailed us time,
 accompanied thick fogs, which, one end platform
 other, see nothing. wind blew sharply all
 parts compass, snow lay hard heaps had
 break blows pickaxe. temperature always 5
 deg. zero; every outward part _nautilus_ covered with
 ice. rigged vessel entangled blocked up
 gorges. vessel without sails, electricity motive power,
 wanting coal, alone brave high latitudes. length,
 18th march, many useless assaults, _nautilus_ was
 positively blocked. longer either streams, packs, or
 ice-fields, interminable immovable barrier, formed by
 mountains soldered together.
 
“an iceberg!” said canadian me.
 
knew ned land, well navigators had
 preceded us, inevitable obstacle. sun appearing an
 instant noon, captain nemo took observation near possible,
 gave situation 51° 30′ long. 67° 39′ s. lat. had
 advanced one degree antarctic region. liquid

 _nautilus_ lay stretched vast plain, entangled confused blocks.
 sharp points slender needles rising height of
 200 feet; steep shore, hewn axe and
 clothed greyish tints; huge mirrors, reflecting rays of
 sunshine, half drowned fog. desolate face of
 nature stern silence reigned, scarcely broken flapping the
 wings petrels puffins. everything frozen—even noise. the
 _nautilus_ obliged stop adventurous course amid
 fields ice. spite efforts, spite powerful
 means employed break ice, _nautilus_ remained immovable.
 generally, can proceed further, return still open to
 us; return impossible advance, every pass had
 closed behind us; moments stationary, we

 astonishing rapidity. obliged admit captain nemo more

 observing situation time past, said me:
 
“well, sir, think this?”
 
“i think caught, captain.”
 

[illustration] _nautilus_ blocked up
 

“so, m. aronnax, really think _nautilus_ disengage
 itself?”
 
“with difficulty, captain; season already far advanced
 reckon breaking ice.”
 
“ah! sir,” said captain nemo, ironical tone, “you will always be
 same. see nothing difficulties obstacles. affirm that
 can _nautilus_ disengage itself, also can go
 still.”
 
“further south?” asked, looking captain.
 
“yes, sir; shall go pole.”
 
“to pole!” exclaimed, unable repress gesture incredulity.
 
“yes,” replied captain, coldly, “to antarctic pole—to that
 unknown point whence springs every meridian globe. know
 whether can please _nautilus!_”
 
yes, knew that. knew man bold, even rashness. but
 conquer obstacles bristled round south pole,
 rendering inaccessible north, yet been
 reached boldest navigators—was mad enterprise, one
 maniac conceived? came head to
 ask captain nemo ever discovered pole never
 yet trodden human creature?
 
“no, sir,” replied; “but will discover together. others
 failed, will fail. never yet led _nautilus_ far
 southern seas; but, repeat, shall go yet.”
 
“i can well believe you, captain,” said i, slightly ironical tone.
 “i believe you! let us go ahead! obstacles us! let us
 smash iceberg! let us blow up; and, resists, let us give
 _nautilus_ wings fly it!”
 
“over it, sir!” said captain nemo, quietly; “no, it, under
 it!”
 
“under it!” exclaimed, sudden idea captain’s projects
 flashing upon mind. understood; wonderful qualities the
 _nautilus_ going serve us superhuman enterprise.
 
“i see beginning understand one another, sir,” said the
 captain, half smiling. “you begin see possibility—i say
 success—of attempt. impossible ordinary
 vessel easy _nautilus_. continent lies pole,
 must stop continent; if, contrary, pole is
 washed open sea, will go even pole.”
 
“certainly,” said i, carried away captain’s reasoning; “if the
 surface solidified ice, lower depths free
 providential law placed maximum density the
 waters ocean one degree higher freezing-point; and, am
 mistaken, portion iceberg water is
 one four below.”
 
“very nearly, sir; one foot iceberg are

“nothing, sir.”
 
“it even seek greater depths uniform temperature of
 sea-water, brave impunity thirty forty degrees of
 surface cold.”
 
“just so, sir—just so,” replied, getting animated.
 
“the difficulty,” continued captain nemo, “is remaining
 several days without renewing provision air.”
 
“is all? _nautilus_ vast reservoirs; can fill them, and
 will supply us oxygen want.”
 
“well thought of, m. aronnax,” replied captain, smiling. “but, not
 wishing accuse rashness, will first give my
 objections.”
 
“have make?”
 
“only one. possible, exists south pole, it
 may covered; and, consequently, shall unable come the
 surface.”
 
“good, sir! forget _nautilus_ armed a
 powerful spur, send diagonally fields
 ice, open shocks.”
 
“ah! sir, full ideas to-day.”
 
“besides, captain,” added, enthusiastically, “why find
 open south pole well north? frozen
 poles earth coincide, either southern the
 northern regions; and, proved contrary, may
 suppose either continent ocean free ice two
 points globe.”
 
“i think too, m. aronnax,” replied captain nemo. “i wish to
 observe that, made many objections project, you
 now crushing arguments favour!”
 
preparations audacious attempt now began. powerful
 pumps _nautilus_ working air reservoirs and
 storing high pressure. four o’clock, captain nemo announced
 closing panels platform. threw one last look the
 massive iceberg going cross. weather clear,
 atmosphere pure enough, cold great, 12° zero;
 but, wind gone down, temperature unbearable.
 ten men mounted sides _nautilus_, armed pickaxes
 break ice around vessel, soon free. operation
 quickly performed, fresh ice still thin. all
 went below. usual reservoirs filled newly-liberated
 water, _nautilus_ soon descended. taken place with

 compass deviated dial. 900 feet, captain nemo had
 foreseen, floating beneath undulating bottom the
 iceberg. _nautilus_ went lower still—it went depth of
 four hundred fathoms. temperature water surface
 showed twelve degrees, now ten; gained two. need
 say temperature _nautilus_ raised heating
 apparatus much higher degree; every manœuvre accomplished with
 wonderful precision.
 
“we shall pass it, please, sir,” said conseil.
 
“i believe shall,” said, tone firm conviction.
 
open sea, _nautilus_ taken course direct the
 pole, without leaving fifty-second meridian. 67° 30′ 90

“why, captain?”
 
“because orb day described lengthened curves it

“in whose name, captain?”
 
“in own, sir!”

“what matter?” said i, once.
 
“i came ask you, sir,” replied conseil.
 
“confound it!” exclaimed canadian, “i know well enough! the

 will right first time torres straits.”
 
“but,” asked, “has least come surface sea?”
 
“we know,” said conseil.
 
“it easy decide,” answered. consulted manometer. my

“we must ask captain nemo,” said conseil.
 
“but shall find him?” said ned land.
 
“follow me,” said i, companions.

 turned towards me, said, using one expressions the
 torres straits:
 
“an incident, captain?”
 
“no, sir; accident time.”
 
“serious?”
 
“perhaps.”
 
“is danger immediate?”
 
“no.”
 
“the _nautilus_ stranded?”
 
“yes.”
 
“and happened—how?”
 
“from caprice nature, ignorance man. mistake
 made working. prevent equilibrium from
 producing effects. may brave human laws, resist
 natural ones.”
 
captain nemo chosen strange moment uttering this
 philosophical reflection. whole, answer helped little.
 
“may ask, sir, cause accident?”
 
“an enormous block ice, whole mountain, turned over,” he
 replied. “when icebergs undermined base warmer water or
 reiterated shocks centre gravity rises, whole thing
 turns over. happened; one blocks, fell,

“but can get _nautilus_ emptying reservoirs, that

“that, sir, done moment. can hear pump
 working. look needle manometer; shows the
 _nautilus_ rising, block ice floating it; and,
 obstacle stops ascending motion, position be
 altered.”
 
indeed, _nautilus_ still held position starboard;
 doubtless right block stopped. this

“at last righted!” exclaimed.
 
“yes,” said captain nemo, going door saloon.
 
“but floating?” asked.
 
“certainly,” replied; “since reservoirs empty; and, when

“how beautiful! beautiful!” cried conseil.
 
“yes,” said, “it wonderful sight. not, ned?”
 
“yes, confound it! yes,” answered ned land, “it superb! mad at

“we going backwards?” said conseil.
 
“yes,” replied. “this end tunnel can egress.”
 
“and then?”
 
“then,” said i, “the working easy. must go back again, go out

speaking thus, wished appear confident really was.
 retrograde motion _nautilus_ increasing; and,
 reversing screw, carried us great speed.
 
“it will hindrance,” said ned.
 
“what matter, hours less, provided get at

“yes,” repeated ned land, “provided get last!”
 
short time walked saloon library. companions

 eyes overran mechanically. quarter hour after, conseil,
 approaching me, said, “is reading interesting, sir?”
 
“very interesting!” replied.
 
“i think so, sir. book reading.”
 
“my book?”

“stay here, friends,” said i, detaining them. “let us remain

“as please, sir,” conseil replied.
 
hours passed. often looked instruments hanging the

“our course barred southward?” asked.
 
“yes, sir. iceberg shifted closed every outlet.”
 
“we blocked then?”
 
“yes.”
 



chapter xvi
 want air
 

thus around _nautilus_, below, impenetrable wall

 countenance resumed habitual imperturbability.
 
“gentlemen,” said calmly, “there two ways dying the
 circumstances placed.” (this puzzling person the
 air mathematical professor lecturing pupils.) “the first is
 crushed; second die suffocation. speak of
 possibility dying hunger, supply provisions the
 _nautilus_ will certainly last longer shall. let us, then,
 calculate chances.”
 
“as suffocation, captain,” replied, “that feared,
 reservoirs full.”
 
“just so; will yield two days’ supply air. now, for
 thirty-six hours hidden water, already the
 heavy atmosphere _nautilus_ requires renewal. forty-eight
 hours reserve will exhausted.”
 
“well, captain, can delivered forty-eight hours?”
 
“we will attempt it, least, piercing wall surrounds us.”
 
“on side?”
 
“sound will tell us. going run _nautilus_ aground the
 lower bank, men will attack iceberg side is
 least thick.”
 
captain nemo went out. soon discovered hissing noise the
 water entering reservoirs. _nautilus_ sank slowly, and
 rested ice depth 350 yards, depth lower
 bank immersed.
 
“my friends,” said, “our situation serious, rely your
 courage energy.”
 
“sir,” replied canadian, “i ready anything general
 safety.”
 
“good! ned,” held hand canadian.
 
“i will add,” continued, “that, handy pickaxe as
 harpoon, can useful captain, can command my
 services.”
 
“he will refuse help. come, ned!”
 
led room crew _nautilus_ putting on
 cork-jackets. told captain ned’s proposal, he
 accepted. canadian put sea-costume, ready soon as
 companions. ned dressed, re-entered drawing-room,
 panes glass open, and, posted near conseil, i
 examined ambient beds supported _nautilus_. instants
 after, saw dozen crew set foot bank ice, and
 among ned land, easily known stature. captain nemo with
 them. proceeding dig walls, took soundings, be
 sure working right direction. long sounding lines sunk
 side walls, fifteen yards stopped by
 thick wall. useless attack ceiling-like
 surface, since iceberg measured 400 yards in
 height. captain nemo sounded lower surface. ten yards of
 wall separated us water, great thickness the
 ice-field. necessary, therefore, cut piece equal in
 extent waterline _nautilus_. 6,000 cubic
 yards detach, dig hole descend the
 ice-field. work begun immediately carried with
 indefatigable energy. instead digging round _nautilus_ which
 involved greater difficulty, captain nemo immense
 trench made eight yards port-quarter. men set to
 work simultaneously screws several points its
 circumference. presently pickaxe attacked compact matter
 vigorously, large blocks detached mass. curious
 effect specific gravity, blocks, lighter water, fled, so
 speak, vault tunnel, increased thickness at
 top proportion diminished base. mattered
 little, long lower part grew thinner. two hours’ hard
 work, ned land came exhausted. comrades replaced by
 new workers, conseil joined. second lieutenant the
 _nautilus_ superintended us. water seemed singularly cold, i
 soon got warm handling pickaxe. movements free enough,
 although made pressure thirty atmospheres. i
 re-entered, working two hours, take food rest, i
 found perceptible difference pure fluid the
 rouquayrol engine supplied atmosphere _nautilus_,
 already charged carbonic acid. air renewed for
 forty-eight hours, vivifying qualities considerably
 enfeebled. however, lapse twelve hours, raised a
 block ice one yard thick, marked surface, 600
 cubic yards! reckoning took twelve hours accomplish this
 much take five nights four days bring enterprise
 satisfactory conclusion. five nights four days! have
 air enough two days reservoirs! “without taking into
 account,” said ned, “that, even get infernal prison,
 shall also imprisoned iceberg, shut all
 possible communication atmosphere.” true enough! could
 foresee minimum time necessary deliverance? we
 might suffocated _nautilus_ regain surface of
 waves? destined perish ice-tomb, those
 enclosed? situation terrible. everyone looked the
 danger face, determined duty last.
 
expected, night new block yard square carried
 away, still sank immense hollow. morning
 when, dressed cork-jacket, traversed slushy mass a
 temperature six seven degrees zero, remarked the
 side walls gradually closing in. beds water farthest from
 trench, warmed men’s work, showed tendency
 solidification. presence new imminent danger, what
 become chances safety, hinder the
 solidification liquid medium, burst partitions
 _nautilus_ like glass?
 
tell companions new danger. good of
 damping energy displayed painful work escape? but
 went board again, told captain nemo grave
 complication.
 
“i know it,” said, calm tone counteract most
 terrible apprehensions. “it one danger more; see way of
 escaping it; chance safety go quicker than
 solidification. must beforehand it, all.”
 
day several hours used pickaxe vigorously. work
 kept up. besides, work quit _nautilus_, breathe
 directly pure air drawn reservoirs, supplied our
 apparatus, quit impoverished vitiated atmosphere.
 towards evening trench dug one yard deeper. returned on
 board, nearly suffocated carbonic acid air
 filled—ah! chemical means drive away this
 deleterious gas. plenty oxygen; water contained a
 considerable quantity, dissolving powerful piles, it
 restore vivifying fluid. thought well it; of
 good that, since carbonic acid produced respiration
 invaded every part vessel? absorb it, necessary to
 fill jars caustic potash, shake incessantly. now
 substance wanting board, nothing replace it. on
 evening, captain nemo open taps reservoirs,
 let pure air interior _nautilus;_ without this
 precaution get rid sense suffocation. next
 day, march 26th, resumed miner’s work beginning fifth yard.
 side walls lower surface iceberg thickened visibly.
 evident meet _nautilus_ able to
 disengage itself. despair seized instant; pickaxe nearly
 fell hands. good digging must be
 suffocated, crushed water turning stone?—a
 punishment ferocity savages even have
 invented! just captain nemo passed near me. touched hand and
 showed walls prison. wall port advanced at
 least four yards hull _nautilus_. captain
 understood me, signed follow him. went board. took
 cork-jacket accompanied drawing-room.
 
“m. aronnax, must attempt desperate means, shall be
 sealed solidified water cement.”
 
“yes; done?”
 
“ah! _nautilus_ strong enough bear pressure without
 crushed!”
 
“well?” asked, catching captain’s idea.
 
“do understand,” replied, “that congelation water
 will help us? see solidification, burst
 field ice imprisons us, as, freezes, it
 bursts hardest stones? perceive an
 agent safety instead destruction?”
 
“yes, captain, perhaps. but, whatever resistance crushing the
 _nautilus_ possesses, support terrible pressure, and
 flattened like iron plate.”
 
“i know it, sir. therefore must reckon aid nature, but
 exertions. must stop solidification. will
 side walls pressed together; ten feet water
 behind _nautilus_. congelation gains us all
 sides.”
 
“how long will air reservoirs last us breathe on
 board?”
 
captain looked face. “after to-morrow will empty!”
 
cold sweat came me. however, astonished at
 answer? march 22, _nautilus_ open polar seas. we
 26°. five days lived reserve board. and
 left respirable air must kept workers. even
 now, write, recollection still vivid involuntary
 terror seizes lungs seem without air. meanwhile,
 captain nemo reflected silently, evidently idea struck him;
 seemed reject it. last, words escaped lips:
 
“boiling water!” muttered.
 
“boiling water?” cried.
 
“yes, sir. enclosed space relatively confined.
 jets boiling water, constantly injected pumps,
 raise temperature part stay congelation?”
 
“let us try it,” said resolutely.
 
“let us try it, professor.”
 
thermometer stood 7° outside. captain nemo took the
 galleys, vast distillatory machines stood furnished the
 drinkable water evaporation. filled water, all
 electric heat piles thrown worms bathed in
 liquid. minutes water reached 100°. directed
 towards pumps, fresh water replaced proportion. the
 heat developed troughs cold water, drawn from
 gone machines, came boiling into
 body pump. injection begun, three hours after
 thermometer marked 6° zero outside. one degree gained.
 two hours later thermometer marked 4°.
 
“we shall succeed,” said captain, anxiously
 watched result operation.
 
“i think,” answered, “that shall crushed. more
 suffocation fear.”
 
night temperature water rose 1° zero.
 injections carry higher point. but, the
 congelation sea-water produces least 2°, least
 reassured dangers solidification.
 
next day, march 27th, six yards ice cleared, twelve
 feet remaining cleared away. yet forty-eight
 hours’ work. air renewed interior the
 _nautilus_. day make worse. intolerable weight
 oppressed me. towards three o’clock evening feeling rose to
 violent degree. yawns dislocated jaws. lungs panted they
 inhaled burning fluid, became rarefied more. a
 moral torpor took hold me. powerless, almost unconscious. my
 brave conseil, though exhibiting symptoms suffering the
 manner, never left me. took hand encouraged me, i
 heard murmur, “oh! breathe, leave more
 air master!”
 
tears came eyes hearing speak thus. situation to
 intolerable interior, haste gladness would
 put cork-jackets work turn! pickaxes sounded the
 frozen ice-beds. arms ached, skin torn hands. but

“what!” said conseil; “cuttlefish, real cuttlefish cephalopod

“in church!” cried canadian.
 
“yes; friend ned. picture representing poulp question.”
 
“good!” said ned land, bursting laughing.

“what fact?” asked ned land.
 
“this it. 1861, north-east teneriffe, nearly in

next day, 1st june, _nautilus_ continued same

 captain nemo took sun’s altitude done day before. the
 beautiful, sky clear. eight miles east, a
 large steam vessel discerned horizon. flag fluttered

 sun passed meridian, captain nemo took sextant, and
 watched great attention. perfect rest water greatly

 patriot ship, told first coldly, emotion this
 strange man pronounced last words, name avenger, the
 significance escape me, impressed deeply
 mind. eyes leave captain, who, hand
 stretched sea, watching glowing eye glorious
 wreck. perhaps never know was, whence came, or
 going to, saw man move, apart the
 _savant_. common misanthropy shut captain nemo and
 companions within _nautilus_, hatred, either monstrous or
 sublime, time never weaken. hatred still seek for
 vengeance? future soon teach that. _nautilus_ was
 rising slowly surface sea, form avenger

“what ship, ned?”
 
“by rigging, height lower masts,” said canadian,
 “i bet ship-of-war. may reach us; and, necessary, sink
 cursed _nautilus_.”
 
“friend ned,” replied conseil, “what harm can _nautilus?_
 can attack beneath waves? can cannonade us bottom
 sea?”
 
“tell me, ned,” said i, “can recognise country belongs
 to?”
 
canadian knitted eyebrows, dropped eyelids, screwed up
 corners eyes, moments fixed piercing look
 upon vessel.
 
“no, sir,” replied; “i tell nation belongs to, for
 shows colours. can declare man-of-war, long
 pennant flutters main mast.”
 
quarter hour watched ship steaming towards
 us. not, however, believe see _nautilus_

“sir,” said ned land, “if vessel passes within mile us i

reply canadian’s suggestion, continued watching
 ship. whether english, french, american, russian, be
 sure take us reach her. presently white smoke
 burst fore part vessel; seconds after, water,
 agitated fall heavy body, splashed stern the
 _nautilus_, shortly afterwards loud explosion struck ear.
 
“what! firing us!” exclaimed.
 
“so please you, sir,” said ned, “they recognised unicorn, and
 firing us.”
 
“but,” exclaimed, “surely can see men the
 case?”
 
“it is, perhaps, that,” replied ned land, looking me.
 
whole flood light burst upon mind. doubtless knew now how
 believe stories pretended monster. doubt, board the
 _abraham lincoln_, canadian struck harpoon,
 commander farragut recognised supposed narwhal submarine

 so; every now seeking engine of

 attacked vessel? man buried coral cemetery, not
 victim shock caused _nautilus?_ yes, repeat it,
 must so. one part mysterious existence captain nemo had
 unveiled; and, identity recognised, least,
 nations united longer hunting chimerical
 creature, man vowed deadly hatred them. the
 formidable past rose me. instead meeting friends board the
 approaching ship, expect pitiless enemies. shot
 rattled us. struck ricochetted, losing
 distance. none touched _nautilus_. vessel

 cannonade, captain nemo appear platform; but, one of
 conical projectiles struck shell _nautilus_, it
 fatal. canadian said, “sir, must we
 can get dilemma. let us signal them. will then,
 perhaps, understand honest folks.”
 
ned land took handkerchief wave air; scarcely
 displayed it, struck iron hand, fell, in
 spite great strength, upon deck.
 
“fool!” exclaimed captain, “do wish pierced spur
 _nautilus_ hurled vessel?”
 
captain nemo terrible hear; still terrible see.
 face deadly pale, spasm heart. instant it
 must ceased beat. pupils fearfully contracted. did
 speak, roared, as, body thrown forward, wrung the
 canadian’s shoulders. then, leaving him, turning ship of
 war, whose shot still raining around him, exclaimed, a
 powerful voice, “ah, ship accursed nation, know am! i
 want colours know by! look! will show you
 mine!”
 
fore part platform captain nemo unfurled black
 flag, similar one placed south pole. that
 moment shot struck shell _nautilus_ obliquely, without
 piercing it; and, rebounding near captain, lost sea. he
 shrugged shoulders; and, addressing me, said shortly, “go down, you
 companions, go down!”
 
“sir,” cried, “are going attack vessel?”
 
“sir, going sink it.”
 
“you will that?”
 
“i shall it,” replied coldly. “and advise judge me,
 sir. fate shown seen. attack has
 begun; go down.”
 
“what vessel?”
 
“you know? well! much better! nationality to

obey. fifteen sailors surrounded captain,
 looking implacable hatred vessel nearing them. one could
 feel desire vengeance animated every soul. went down
 moment another projectile struck _nautilus_, heard the
 captain exclaim:
 
“strike, mad vessel! shower useless shot! then, will not
 escape spur _nautilus_. shall
 perish! ruins mingle avenger!”
 
reached room. captain second remained the
 platform. screw set motion, _nautilus_, moving with
 speed, soon beyond reach ship’s guns. pursuit
 continued, captain nemo contented keeping his
 distance.
 
four afternoon, longer able contain my
 impatience, went central staircase. panel open, i
 ventured platform. captain still walking down
 agitated step. looking ship, five or
 six miles leeward.
 
going round like wild beast, and, drawing eastward, he
 allowed pursue. attack. perhaps still
 hesitated? wished mediate more. scarcely spoken,
 captain nemo imposed silence, saying:
 
“i law, judge! oppressed, the
 oppressor! lost loved, cherished, and
 venerated—country, wife, children, father, mother. saw all
 perish! hate there! say more!”
 
cast last look man-of-war, putting steam, and
 rejoined ned conseil.
 
“we will fly!” exclaimed.
 
“good!” said ned. “what vessel?”
 
“i know; but, whatever is, will sunk night. in
 case, better perish it, made accomplices a
 retaliation justice judge.”
 
“that opinion too,” said ned land, coolly. “let us wait for
 night.”
 
night arrived. deep silence reigned board. compass showed that
 _nautilus_ altered course. surface,
 rolling slightly. companions resolved fly vessel
 near enough either hear us see us; moon,
 full two three days, shone brightly. board
 ship, prevent blow threatened it, we
 could, least would, circumstances allow.
 several times thought _nautilus_ preparing attack; but
 captain nemo contented allowing adversary approach,
 fled it.

 ned land thrown sea, forced to
