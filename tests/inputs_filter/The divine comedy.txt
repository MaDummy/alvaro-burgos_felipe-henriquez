hell
 inferno
 



canto i
 

midway mortal life,
 found gloomy wood, astray
 gone path direct: e’en tell
 easy task, savage wild
 forest, robust rough growth,
 remember only, dismay
 renews, bitterness far death.
 yet discourse good befell,
 else will relate discover’d there.
 first enter’d scarce can say,
 sleepy dullness instant weigh’d
 senses down, true path left,
 mountain’s foot reach’d, clos’d
 valley, pierc’d heart dread,
 look’d aloft, saw shoulders broad
 already vested planet’s beam,
 leads wanderers safe every way.
 
little respite fear,
 heart’s recesses deep lain,
 night, pitifully pass’d:
 man, difficult short breath,
 forespent toiling, ’scap’d shore,
 turns perilous wide waste, stands
 gaze; e’en spirit, yet fail’d
 struggling terror, turn’d view straits,
 none hath pass’d liv’d. weary frame
 short pause recomforted, again
 journey’d lonely steep,
 
hinder foot still firmer. scarce ascent
 began, when, lo! panther, nimble, light,
 cover’d speckled skin, appear’d,
 nor, saw me, vanish’d, rather strove
 check onward going; ofttimes
 purpose retrace steps turn’d.
 
hour morning’s prime, way
 aloft sun ascended stars,
 rose, love divine first mov’d
 fair works: joyous hope
 things conspir’d fill me, gay skin
 swift animal, matin dawn
 sweet season. soon joy chas’d,
 new dread succeeded, view
 lion came, ’gainst me, appear’d,
 
head held aloft hunger-mad,
 e’en air fear-struck. she-wolf
 heels, leanness seem’d
 full wants, many land hath made
 disconsolate ere now. fear
 o’erwhelmed me, sight appall’d,
 height hope lost. one,
 gain elated, sees time
 unwares gone, inwardly
 mourns heart-griping anguish; i,
 haunted fell beast, never peace,
 coming o’er me, degrees
 impell’d sun silence rests.
 
lower space backward step
 fell, ken discern’d form one one,
 whose voice seem’d faint long disuse speech.
 great desert espied,
 “have mercy me!” cried aloud,
 “spirit! living man! e’er thou be!”
 
answer’d: “now man, man was,
 born lombard parents, mantuana both
 country, power julius yet
 scarcely firm. rome life past
 beneath mild augustus, time
 fabled deities false. bard
 i, made anchises’ upright son
 subject song, came troy,
 flames prey’d ilium’s haughty towers.
 thou, say wherefore perils past
 return’st thou? wherefore pleasant mount
 ascendest, cause source delight?”
 “and art thou virgil, well-spring,
 copious floods eloquence
 issued?” front abash’d replied.
 “glory light tuneful train!
 may avail long zeal
 sought thy volume, love immense
 conn’d o’er. master thou guide!
 thou alone deriv’d
 style, beauty fame
 exalts me. see beast, fled.
 save her, thou illustrious sage!
 
“for every vein pulse throughout frame
 hath made tremble.” he, soon saw
 weeping, answer’d, “thou must needs
 another way pursue, thou wouldst ’scape
 savage wilderness. beast,
 thou criest, way will suffer none
 pass, less hindrance makes death:
 bad accursed kind,
 never sated ravenous will,
 still food craving before.
 many animal wedlock vile
 fastens, shall yet many more,
 greyhound come, shall destroy
 sharp pain. will life support
 earth base metals, love,
 wisdom, virtue, land shall be
 land ’twixt either feltro. might
 shall safety italia’s plains arise,
 whose fair realm, camilla, virgin pure,
 nisus, euryalus, turnus fell.
 incessant chase every town
 shall worry, hell length
 restore her, thence envy first let loose.
 thy profit pond’ring now devise,
 thou mayst follow me, thy guide
 will lead thee hence eternal space,
 thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, see
 spirits old tormented, invoke
 second death; next view, dwell
 content fire, hope come,
 whene’er time may be, among blest,
 whose regions thou desire
 t’ ascend, spirit worthier i
 must lead thee, whose charge, depart,
 thou shalt left: almighty king,
 reigns above, rebel law,
 adjudges me, therefore hath decreed,
 city none come.
 parts hath sway; rules, holds
 citadel throne. happy those,
 chooses!” few:
 “bard! god, thou didst adore,
 beseech thee (that ill worse
 may escape) lead me, thou saidst,
 saint peter’s gate may view, those
 thou tell’st, dismal plight.”
 
onward mov’d, close steps pursu’d.
 



canto ii
 

now day departing, air,
 imbrown’d shadows, toils releas’d
 animals earth; alone
 prepar’d conflict sustain,
 sad pity, perilous road,
 unerring memory shall retrace.
 
muses! high genius! now vouchsafe
 aid! mind! saw hast kept
 safe written record, thy worth
 eminent endowments come proof.
 
thus began: “bard! thou art guide,
 consider well, virtue me
 sufficient, ere high enterprise
 thou trust me. thou hast told silvius’ sire,
 yet cloth’d corruptible flesh, among
 th’ immortal tribes entrance, there
 sensible present. yet heaven’s great lord,
 almighty foe ill, favour shew’d,
 contemplation high effect,
 issue forth,
 seems reason’s judgment well deserv’d:
 sith rome, rome’s empire wide,
 heaven’s empyreal height chosen sire:
 which, truth spoken, ordain’d
 ’stablish’d holy place, sits
 great peter’s sacred chair succeeds.

 learn’d things, victory gave rise
 papal robe. after-times
 chosen vessel also travel’d there,
 bring us back assurance faith,
 entrance salvation’s way.
 i, presume? who
 permits it? aeneas paul.
 deem worthy, none else
 will deem me. i, voyage then
 venture, fear will folly end.
 thou, art wise, better meaning know’st,
 can speak.” one, unresolves
 hath late resolv’d, new thoughts
 changes purpose, first intent
 remov’d; e’en dun coast,
 wasting thought enterprise, first
 eagerly embrac’d. “if right thy words
 scan,” replied shade magnanimous,
 “thy soul vile fear assail’d, oft
 overcasts man, recoils
 noblest resolution, like beast
 false semblance twilight gloom.
 terror thou mayst free thyself,
 will instruct thee came, what
 heard instant, thee
 grief touch’d first. among tribe,
 rest suspended, dame, blest
 lovely, besought command,
 call’d me; eyes brighter star
 day; gentle voice soft
 angelically tun’d speech address’d:
 “o courteous shade mantua! thou whose fame
 yet lives, shall live long nature lasts!
 friend, fortune myself,
 wide desert road met
 hindrance great, fear turn’d.
 now much dread lest past help stray’d,
 ris’n late relief,
 heaven heard. speed now,
 thy eloquent persuasive tongue,
 means deliverance meet,
 assist him. will comfort spring.
 now bid thee errand forth
 beatrice; place come.
 
(note: beatrice. use word, is
 pronounced italian, consisting four
 syllables, third long one.) revisited joy. love
 brought thence,
 prompts speech. master’s sight
 stand, thy praise oft will tell.”
 
silent, thus began:
 “o lady! whose influence alone,
 mankind excels whatever contain’d
 within heaven hath smallest orb,
 thy command delights me, obey,
 done already, seem late.
 need hast thou farther speak thy will;
 yet tell reason, thou art loth
 leave ample space, return
 thou burnest, centre beneath.”
 
then: “since thou deeply wouldst inquire,
 will instruct thee briefly, dread
 hinders entrance here. things alone
 fear’d, whence evil may proceed,
 none else, none terrible beside.
 fram’d god, thanks grace!
 suff’rance misery
 touches not, flame fierce fire
 assails me. high heaven blessed dame
 besides, mourns effectual grief

 god’s stern judgment will inclines.”
 lucia calling, thus bespake:
 “now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid
 commend thee.” word
 sped lucia, cruelty foe,
 coming place, abode
 seated rachel, ancient days,
 thus address’d me: “thou true praise god!
 beatrice! thy succour lent

 thy sake multitude admires?
 dost thou hear pitiful wail,

 swoln mightier sea, struggling holds?”
 ne’er among men speed

 words spoken, came here,
 blessed seat, trusting force

 well mark’d it, honour brings.”
 
“when ended, bright beaming eyes

 redoubled zeal serve thee. will’d,
 thus come: sav’d thee beast,

 prevented. comes o’er thee then?
 why, dost thou hang back? thy breast
 harbour vile fear? hast courage there

 thy safety plan, e’en court heaven;
 much certain good words forebode.”
 
florets, frosty air night
 bent clos’d, day blanch’d leaves,
 rise unfolded spiry stems;
 fainting vigour new restor’d,
 heart kindly courage ran,
 one undaunted soon replied:
 “o full pity she, undertook
 succour! thou kind didst perform
 soon true behest! desire
 thou hast dispos’d renew voyage,
 first purpose fully resum’d.
 lead on: one will us both.
 thou art guide, master thou, lord.”
 
spake i; onward mov’d,
 enter’d deep woody way.
 



canto iii
 

“through pass city woe:
 pass eternal pain:
 among people lost aye.
 justice founder fabric mov’d:
 rear task power divine,
 supremest wisdom, primeval love.
 things create none, save things
 eternal, eternal endure.
 
“all hope abandon ye enter here.”
 
characters colour dim mark’d
 portal’s lofty arch inscrib’d:
 whereat thus: “master, words import
 hard meaning.” one prepar’d replied:
 “here thou must distrust behind thee leave;
 vile fear extinguish’d. come
 told thee shall see souls
 misery doom’d, intellectual good
 lost.” hand stretch’d forth
 mine, pleasant looks, whence cheer’d,
 secret place led on.
 
sighs lamentations loud moans
 resounded air pierc’d star,
 e’en wept entering. various tongues,
 horrible languages, outcries woe,
 accents anger, voices deep hoarse,
 hands together smote swell’d sounds,
 made tumult, ever whirls
 round air solid darkness stain’d,
 like sand whirlwind flies.
 
then, error yet encompass’d, cried:
 “o master! hear? race
 these, seem overcome woe?”
 
thus me: “this miserable fate
 suffer wretched souls those, liv’d
 without praise blame, ill band
 angels mix’d, rebellious prov’d
 yet true god, themselves
 only. bounds heaven drove forth,
 impair lustre, depth
 hell receives them, lest th’ accursed tribe
 glory thence exultation vain.”
 
then: “master! doth aggrieve thus,
 lament loud?” straight replied:
 “that will tell thee briefly. death
 hope may entertain: blind life
 meanly passes, lots
 envy. fame world hath none,
 suffers; mercy justice scorn both.
 speak them, look, pass by.”
 
i, straightway look’d, beheld flag,
 whirling ran around rapidly,
 pause obtain’d: following came
 long train spirits, ne’er
 thought, death many despoil’d.
 
recogniz’d, saw
 knew shade him, base fear
 yielding, abjur’d high estate. forthwith
 understood certain tribe
 ill spirits god displeasing
 foes. wretches, ne’er lived,
 went nakedness, sorely stung
 wasps hornets, bedew’d cheeks
 blood, mix’d tears dropp’d feet,
 disgustful worms gather’d there.
 
looking farther onwards beheld
 throng upon shore great stream:
 whereat thus: “sir! grant now know
 view, whence impell’d seem
 eager pass o’er, discern
 blear light?” thus few:
 “this shalt thou know, soon steps arrive
 beside woeful tide acheron.”
 
eyes downward cast fill’d shame,
 fearing words offensive ear,
 till reach’d river, speech
 abstain’d. lo! toward us bark
 comes old man hoary white eld,
 
crying, “woe wicked spirits! hope not
 ever see sky again. come
 take shore across,
 eternal darkness, dwell
 fierce heat ice. thou, there
 standest, live spirit! get thee hence, leave
 dead.” soon beheld
 left not, “by way,” said he,
 “by haven shalt thou come shore,
 passage; thee nimbler boat
 must carry.” thus spake guide:
 “charon! thyself torment not: ’t will’d,
 will power one: ask thou more.”
 
straightway silence fell shaggy cheeks
 boatman o’er livid lake,
 around whose eyes glar’d wheeling flames. meanwhile
 spirits, faint naked, color chang’d,
 gnash’d teeth, soon cruel words
 heard. god parents blasphem’d,
 human kind, place, time, seed
 engender give birth.
 
together sorely wailing drew
 curs’d strand, every man must pass
 fears god. charon, demoniac form,
 eyes burning coal, collects all,
 beck’ning, each, lingers, oar
 strikes. fall light autumnal leaves,
 one still another following, till bough
 strews honours earth beneath;
 
e’en like manner adam’s evil brood
 cast one one shore,
 beck, falcon call.
 
thus go umber’d wave,
 ever opposing bank
 landed, side another throng
 still gathers. “son,” thus spake courteous guide,
 “those, die subject wrath god,
 together come every clime,
 o’erpass river loth:
 heaven’s justice goads on, fear
 turn’d desire. hence ne’er hath past
 good spirit. thee charon complain,
 now mayst thou know import words.”
 
said, gloomy region trembling shook
 terribly, yet clammy dews
 fear chills brow. sad earth gave blast,
 that, lightening, shot forth vermilion flame,
 senses conquer’d quite, i
 dropp’d, one sudden slumber seiz’d.
 



canto iv
 

broke deep slumber brain crash
 heavy thunder, shook myself,
 one main force rous’d. risen upright,
 rested eyes mov’d around, search’d
 fixed ken know place was,
 wherein stood. certain brink
 found lamentable vale,
 dread abyss, joins thund’rous sound
 plaints innumerable. dark deep,
 thick clouds o’erspread, mine eye vain

“now let us blind world beneath
 descend;” bard began pale look:
 “i go first, thou shalt follow next.”
 
alter’d hue perceiving, thus:
 “how may speed, thou yieldest dread,
 still art wont comfort doubt?”
 
then: “the anguish race below

 mistakest. let us on. length way

 ent’ring led bounds

 here, mine ear note, plaint heard
 except sighs, made th’ eternal air
 tremble, caus’d tortures, grief
 felt multitudes, many vast,

piercing secret purport speech,
 answer’d: “i new estate,

 still passing wood; name

 distant, far part

 place possess’d. “o thou, every art

 honour, separate rest?”
 
answer’d: “the renown great names
 echoes world above, acquires
 favour heaven, holds thus advanc’d.”
 meantime voice heard: “honour bard
 sublime! shade returns left us late!”
 sooner ceas’d sound, beheld
 four mighty spirits toward us bend steps,
 semblance neither sorrowful glad.
 
thus master kind began: “mark him,

beheld united bright school

 o’er others like eagle soars.
 together short discourse held,

canto v
 

first circle descended thus
 second, which, lesser space
 embracing, much grief contains
 provoking bitter moans. there, minos stands
 grinning ghastly feature: he, all
 enter, strict examining crimes,
 
gives sentence, dismisses beneath,
 according foldeth around:
 comes th’ ill fated soul,
 confesses; judge severe
 sins, considering place hell

“o thou! residence woe

 “note thou, nearer us approach.
 
“then love carries along,

sense reviving, erewhile droop’d
 pity kindred shades, whence grief
 o’ercame wholly, straight around see
 new torments, new tormented souls, way
 soe’er move, turn, bend sight.
 third circle arrive, show’rs
 ceaseless, accursed, heavy, cold, unchang’d
 ever, kind degree.
 large hail, discolour’d water, sleety flaw
 dun midnight air stream’d amain:
 stank land whereon tempest fell.
 
cerberus, cruel monster, fierce strange,
 wide threefold throat barks dog
 multitude immers’d beneath.
 eyes glare crimson, black unctuous beard,
 belly large, claw’d hands, which
 tears spirits, flays them, limbs
 piecemeal disparts. howling spread, curs,
 rainy deluge, one side
 screening, oft roll round,
 wretched, godless crew. great worm
 descried us, savage cerberus, op’d

we, o’er shades thrown prostrate brunt
 heavy tempest passing, set feet
 upon emptiness, substance seem’d.
 
along earth extended lay
 save one, sudden rais’d sit,
 soon way saw us pass. “o thou!”
 cried, “who infernal shades art led,
 own, thou know’st me. thou wast fram’d
 ere frame broken.” replied:
 “the anguish thou endur’st perchance takes
 thy form remembrance, seems
 saw thee never. inform
 thou art, place sad
 art set, torment, although
 greater, disgustful none

“thy city heap’d envy brim,

 wont name ciacco. sin
 glutt’ny, damned vice, beneath rain,
 e’en thou see’st, fatigue worn;
 sole spirit woe: these
 like crime incurr’d like punishment.”
 
said, speech resum’d:
 “ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves much,
 even tears. tell me, thou know’st,
 shall length befall citizens
 divided city; whether just one
 inhabit there: tell cause,
 whence jarring discord hath assail’d thus?”
 
then: “after long striving will come
 blood; wild party woods
 will chase much injury forth.

canto i
 

midway mortal life,
 found gloomy wood, astray
 gone path direct: e’en tell
 easy task, savage wild
 forest, robust rough growth,
 remember only, dismay
 renews, bitterness far death.
 yet discourse good befell,
 else will relate discover’d there.
 first enter’d scarce can say,
 sleepy dullness instant weigh’d
 senses down, true path left,
 mountain’s foot reach’d, clos’d
 valley, pierc’d heart dread,
 look’d aloft, saw shoulders broad
 already vested planet’s beam,
 leads wanderers safe every way.
 
little respite fear,
 heart’s recesses deep lain,
 night, pitifully pass’d:
 man, difficult short breath,
 forespent toiling, ’scap’d shore,
 turns perilous wide waste, stands
 gaze; e’en spirit, yet fail’d
 struggling terror, turn’d view straits,
 none hath pass’d liv’d. weary frame
 short pause recomforted, again
 journey’d lonely steep,
 
hinder foot still firmer. scarce ascent
 began, when, lo! panther, nimble, light,
 cover’d speckled skin, appear’d,
 nor, saw me, vanish’d, rather strove
 check onward going; ofttimes
 purpose retrace steps turn’d.
 
hour morning’s prime, way
 aloft sun ascended stars,
 rose, love divine first mov’d
 fair works: joyous hope
 things conspir’d fill me, gay skin
 swift animal, matin dawn
 sweet season. soon joy chas’d,
 new dread succeeded, view
 lion came, ’gainst me, appear’d,
 
head held aloft hunger-mad,
 e’en air fear-struck. she-wolf
 heels, leanness seem’d
 full wants, many land hath made
 disconsolate ere now. fear
 o’erwhelmed me, sight appall’d,
 height hope lost. one,
 gain elated, sees time
 unwares gone, inwardly
 mourns heart-griping anguish; i,
 haunted fell beast, never peace,
 coming o’er me, degrees
 impell’d sun silence rests.
 
lower space backward step
 fell, ken discern’d form one one,
 whose voice seem’d faint long disuse speech.
 great desert espied,
 “have mercy me!” cried aloud,
 “spirit! living man! e’er thou be!”
 
answer’d: “now man, man was,
 born lombard parents, mantuana both
 country, power julius yet
 scarcely firm. rome life past
 beneath mild augustus, time
 fabled deities false. bard
 i, made anchises’ upright son
 subject song, came troy,
 flames prey’d ilium’s haughty towers.
 thou, say wherefore perils past
 return’st thou? wherefore pleasant mount
 ascendest, cause source delight?”
 “and art thou virgil, well-spring,
 copious floods eloquence
 issued?” front abash’d replied.
 “glory light tuneful train!
 may avail long zeal
 sought thy volume, love immense
 conn’d o’er. master thou guide!
 thou alone deriv’d
 style, beauty fame
 exalts me. see beast, fled.
 save her, thou illustrious sage!
 
“for every vein pulse throughout frame
 hath made tremble.” he, soon saw
 weeping, answer’d, “thou must needs
 another way pursue, thou wouldst ’scape
 savage wilderness. beast,
 thou criest, way will suffer none
 pass, less hindrance makes death:
 bad accursed kind,
 never sated ravenous will,
 still food craving before.
 many animal wedlock vile

 “bard! god, thou didst adore,
 beseech thee (that ill worse

onward mov’d, close steps pursu’d.

 horrible languages, outcries woe,
 accents anger, voices deep hoarse,
 hands together smote swell’d sounds,
 made tumult, ever whirls

then, error yet encompass’d, cried:
 “o master! hear? race

thus me: “this miserable fate

 “that will tell thee briefly. death

straightway silence fell shaggy cheeks
