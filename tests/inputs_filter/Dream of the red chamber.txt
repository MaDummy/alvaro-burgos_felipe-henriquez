 combine, furthermore, design giving word warning my
 readers.
 
reader, can suggest whence story begins?
 
narration may border limits incoherency triviality,
 possesses considerable zest. begin.
 
empress nü wo, (the goddess works,) fashioning blocks of
 stones, repair heavens, prepared, ta huang hills
 wu ch'i cave, 36,501 blocks rough stone, twelve chang in
 height, twenty-four chang square. stones, empress wo
 used 36,500; one single block remained above,
 without turned account. cast ch'ing keng
 peak. stone, strange say, undergone process of
 refinement, attained nature efficiency, could, innate
 powers, set motion able expand contract.
 
became aware whole number blocks made use
 repair heavens, alone destitute the
 necessary properties unfit attain selection, it
 forthwith felt within vexation shame, day night, it
 gave way anguish sorrow.
 
one day, lamented lot, suddenly caught sight, great
 distance, buddhist bonze taoist priest coming towards that
 direction. appearance uncommon, easy manner remarkable.
 drew near ch'ing keng peak, sat ground to
 rest, began converse. noticing block newly-polished
 brilliantly clear, moreover contracted dimensions, and
 become larger pendant fan, greatly filled
 admiration. buddhist priest picked up, laid the
 palm hand.
 
"your appearance," said laughingly, "may well declare a
 supernatural object, lack inherent quality is
 necessary inscribe characters you, every one who
 shall see may recognise remarkable thing. and
 subsequently, will taken country honour and
 affluence will reign, family cultured mind official
 status, land flowers trees shall flourish with
 luxuriance, town refinement, renown glory; once
 will there..."
 
stone listened intense delight.
 
"what characters may ask," consequently inquired, "will you
 inscribe? place will taken to? pray, pray explain in
 lucid terms." "you inquisitive," bonze replied, a
 smile, "in days come certainly understand everything." having
 concluded words, forthwith put stone sleeve, and
 proceeded leisurely journey, company taoist priest.
 whither, however, took stone, divulged. can be
 known many centuries ages elapsed, taoist priest, k'ung
 k'ung name, passed, researches eternal reason
 quest immortality, ta huang hills, wu ch'i cave
 ch'ing keng peak. suddenly perceiving large block stone, the
 surface traces characters giving, connected form,
 various incidents fate, clearly deciphered, k'ung
 k'ung examined first last. they, fact, explained how
 block worthless stone originally devoid the
 properties essential repairs heavens, be
 transmuted human form introduced mang mang high lord,
 miao miao, divine, world mortals, would
 led bank (across san sara). surface, the
 record spot fall, place birth, well
 various family trifles trivial love affairs young ladies,
 verses, odes, speeches enigmas still complete; name of
 dynasty year reign obliterated, be
 ascertained.
 
obverse, also following enigmatical verses:
 
lacking virtues meet azure skies mend,
 vain mortal world full many year wend,
 former life facts be,
 will tradition strange record me?
 
k'ung k'ung, taoist, pondered lines while,
 became aware stone history kind.
 
"brother stone," forthwith said, addressing stone, "the concerns
 past days recorded possess, according account, a
 considerable amount interest, reason
 inscribed, intent soliciting generations hand down
 remarkable occurrences. opinion, lack, the
 first place, data means establish name the
 emperor year reign; and, second place, these
 constitute record excellent policy, adopted high
 worthies high loyal statesmen, government state, in
 rule public morals. contents simply treat certain number
 maidens, exceptional character; either love affairs or
 infatuations, small deserts insignificant talents; and
 transcribe whole collection them, would,
 nevertheless, estimated book exceptional worth."
 
"sir priest," stone replied assurance, "why so
 excessively dull? dynasties recorded rustic histories, which
 written age age, have, fain think, invariably
 assumed, false pretences, mere nomenclature and
 t'ang dynasties. differ events inscribed block,
 borrow customary practice, but, based own
 experiences natural feelings, present, contrary, novel and
 unique character. besides, pages rustic histories,
 either aspersions upon sovereigns statesmen, strictures
 upon individuals, wives, daughters, deeds of
 licentiousness violence numerous computed. indeed,
 one kind loose literature, wantonness pollution
 work easy havoc upon youth.
 
"as regards works, characters scholars beauties
 delineated allusions repeatedly wen chün, their
 theme every page tzu chien; thousand volumes present no
 diversity; thousand characters counterpart each
 other. more, works, throughout pages, cannot
 help bordering extreme licence. authors, however, other
 object view give utterance sentimental odes and
 elegant ballads own, reason fictitiously
 invented names surnames men women, necessarily
 introduced, addition, low characters, should, like buffoon
 play, create excitement plot.
 
"still loathsome kind pedantic profligate literature,
 perfectly devoid natural sentiment, full self-contradictions;
 and, fact, contrast maidens work, have,
 half lifetime, seen eyes heard own

 heroes heroines works former ages, yet perusal the
 motives issues experiences, may likewise afford matter
 sufficient banish dulness, break spell melancholy.
 
"as regards several stanzas doggerel verse, may evoke

"in pages, scenes depicting anguish separation, the

"my object men may, drinking bout, after
 wake sleep need relaxation pressure of
 business, take light literature, expunge traces
 antiquated books, obtain new kind distraction, they
 may also lay long life well energy strength; bears
 point similarity works, whose designs false, whose
 course immoral. now, sir priest, views subject?"
 
k'ung k'ung pondered words, had
 listened intently, re-perused, throughout, record stone; and
 finding general purport consisted nought else a
 treatise love, likewise accurate transcription facts,
 without least taint profligacy injurious times, he
 thereupon copied contents, beginning end, intent of
 charging world hand strange story.
 
hence k'ung k'ung, taoist, consequence his
 perception, (in state of) abstraction, passion, generation,
 passion, voluptuousness, transmission this
 voluptuousness passion, apprehension, means passion,
 unreality, forthwith altered name "ch'ing tseng"
 (the voluptuous bonze), changed title "the memoir stone"
 (shih-t'ou-chi,) "ch'ing tseng lu," record the
 voluptuous bonze; k'ung mei-chi tung lu gave name of
 "feng yüeh pao chien," "the precious mirror voluptuousness." later
 years, owing devotion tsao hsüeh-ch'in tao hung study,
 ten years perusal revision work, additions and
 modifications effected five times, affix index the
 division periods chapters, book entitled "chin
 ling shih erh ch'ai," "the twelve maidens chin ling." stanza was
 furthermore composed purpose. then, other, the
 origin record stone. poet says appositely:--
 
pages full silly litter,
 tears handful sour bitter;
 fool author hold,
 zest can unfold?
 
now understood causes brought record the
 stone, not, yet, aware characters depicted,
 circumstances related surface block, reader,
 please lend ear narrative stone, runs as
 follows:--
 
old days, land south east lay low. south-east part
 world, situated walled town, ku name. within the
 walls locality, called ch'ang men, others
 throughout mortal world, centre, held second, not
 first place fashion life. beyond ch'ang men a
 street called shih-li-chieh (ten _li_ street); street lane,
 jen ch'ing lane (humanity purity); lane stood old
 temple, account diminutive dimensions, called, by
 general consent, gourd temple. next door temple lived the
 family district official, chen surname, fei name, and
 shih-yin style. wife, née feng, possessed worthy virtuous
 disposition, clear perception moral propriety good
 conduct. family, though actual possession excessive
 affluence honours, was, nevertheless, district, conceded to
 clan well-to-do standing. chen shih-yin a
 contented unambitious frame mind, entertained hankering
 official distinction, day day life took
 delight gazing flowers, planting bamboos, sipping wine and
 conning poetical works, fact, indulgence these
 pursuits, happy supernatural being.
 
one thing alone marred happiness. lived half century
 had, yet, male offspring around knees. one only
 child, daughter, whose infant name ying lien. just three
 years age. long summer day, heat intense,
 shih-yin sat leisurely library. feeling hand tired, he
 dropped book held, leant head teapoy, fell asleep.
 
sudden, state unconsciousness, seemed he
 betaken foot spot whither not
 discriminate. unexpectedly espied, opposite direction, two
 priests coming towards him: one buddhist, taoist. as
 advanced kept conversation engaged.
 "whither purpose taking object brought away?" he
 heard taoist inquire. question buddhist replied a
 smile: "set mind ease," said; "there's now maturity plot
 general character involving mundane pleasures, will presently
 come denouement. whole number votaries voluptuousness
 have, yet, quickened entered world, mean to
 avail occasion introduce object among their
 number, give chance go span human
 existence." "the votaries voluptuousness days will naturally
 endure ills life course the
 mortal world," taoist remarked; "but when, wonder, will they
 spring existence? place will descend?"
 
"the account circumstances," bonze ventured reply, "is
 enough make laugh! amount this: existed the
 west, bank ling (spiritual) river, side san
 sheng (thrice-born) stone, blade chiang chu (purple pearl)
 grass. time block stone was,
 consequent upon rejection goddess works, also left to
 ramble wander gratification, roam at
 pleasure every place. one day came within precincts of
 ching huan (monitory vision) fairy; fairy, cognizant the
 fact stone history, detained it, therefore, reside at
 ch'ih hsia (purple clouds) palace, apportioned duties
 attendant shen ying, fairy ch'ih hsia palace.
 
"this stone would, however, often stroll along banks ling
 river, sight blade spiritual grass been
 filled admiration, it, day day, moistened roots sweet
 dew. purple pearl grass, outset, tarried months and
 years; later period imbued essence and
 luxuriance heaven earth, incessantly received the
 moisture nurture sweet dew, divested itself, course of
 time, form grass; assuming, lieu, human nature, which
 gradually became perfected person girl.
 
"every day wont wander beyond confines li hen

 (hidden love) fruit--when thirsty drank kuan ch'ou (discharged
 sorrows,) water. having, however, time, shewn her
 gratitude virtue nurture lavished upon her, result was
 natural resolve heart upon constant and
 incessant purpose make suitable acknowledgment.
 
"i been," often commune within herself, "the recipient of
 gracious bounty rain dew, possess water was
 lavished upon repay it! ever descend world
 form human being, will also betake thither, along
 it; can means making restitution it,
 tears whole lifetime, may able make adequate
 return."
 
"this resolution will evolve descent world so
 many pleasure-bound spirits retribution experience of
 fantastic destinies; crimson pearl blade will also among the
 number. stone still lies original place, not
 take along tribunal monitory vision
 fairy, place behalf name record, should
 descend world, company spirits passion, and
 bring plot issue?"
 
"it indeed ridiculous," interposed taoist. "never i
 heard even mention restitution means tears! should
 avail opportunity likewise go down
 world? successful effecting salvation of
 them, will work meritorious virtuous?"
 
"this proposal," remarked buddhist, "is quite harmony own
 views. come along palace monitory vision
 fairy, let us deliver good-for-nothing object, done
 it! company pleasure-bound spirits wrath descend
 human existence, can enter world. half them
 already fallen dusty universe, whole number of
 not, yet, come together."
 
"such case," taoist acquiesced, "i ready follow you,
 whenever please go."
 
return chen shih-yin. heard every one words
 distinctly, refrain forthwith stepping forward and
 paying homage. "my spiritual lords," said, smiled, "accept my
 obeisance." buddhist taoist priests lost time responding
 compliment, exchanged usual salutations. "my
 spiritual lords," shih-yin continued; "i just heard the
 conversation passed you, causes effects, a
 conversation like mortals forsooth listened to;
 younger brother sluggish intellect, lucidly
 fathom import! yet dulness simplicity graciously
 dispelled, younger brother may, listening minutely, with
 undefiled ear careful attention, certain degree aroused a
 sense understanding; more, possibly find means of
 escaping anguish sinking hades."
 
two spirits smiled, "the conversation," added, "refers the
 primordial scheme divulged proper season; but,
 time comes, mind forget us two, will readily be
 able escape fiery furnace."
 
shih-yin, reply, felt difficult make further
 inquiries. "the primordial scheme," however remarked smiling,
 "cannot, course, divulged; manner thing, wonder, is
 good-for-nothing object alluded short back? may not
 allowed judge myself?"
 
"this object ask," buddhist bonze responded, "is
 intended, may tell you, fate just glanced you." with
 words produced it, handed shih-yin.
 
shih-yin received it. scrutiny found it, fact, a
 beautiful gem, lustrous clear traces characters on
 surface distinctly visible. characters inscribed consisted
 four "t'ung ling pao yü," "precious gem spiritual perception."
 obverse, also several columns minute words, was
 just act looking intently, buddhist once
 expostulated.
 
"we already reached," exclaimed, "the confines vision."
 snatching violently hands, walked away taoist,
 lofty stone portal, face appeared large type
 four characters: "t'ai hsü huan ching," "the visionary limits the
 great void." side scroll lines:
 
falsehood stands truth, truth likewise becomes false,
 naught made aught, aught changes naught.
 
shih-yin meant also follow side, but, was
 make one step forward, suddenly heard crash, just if
 mountains fallen ruins, earth sunk into
 destruction. shih-yin uttered loud shout, looked strained
 eye; see fiery sun shining, glowing rays,
 banana leaves drooped heads. time, half the
 circumstances connected dream had, already slipped
 memory.
 
also noticed nurse coming towards ying lien arms.
 shih-yin's eyes daughter appeared even beautiful, a
 bright gem, precious, lovable. forthwith stretching his
 arms, took over, and, held embrace, coaxed
 play while; brought the
 street see great stir occasioned procession going
 past.
 
come in, caught sight two priests, one a
 taoist, buddhist, coming hither opposite direction.
 buddhist head covered mange, went barefooted. the
 taoist limping foot, hair dishevelled.
 
like maniacs, jostled along, chattering laughing drew
 near.
 
soon reached shih-yin's door, perceived with
 ying lien arms, bonze began weep aloud.
 
turning towards shih-yin, said him: "my good sir, need you
 carry embrace living luckless thing, will involve
 father mother trouble?"
 
words escape shih-yin's ear; persuaded they
 amounted raving talk, paid heed whatever bonze.
 
"part give me," buddhist still went say.
 
shih-yin restrain annoyance; hastily pressing his
 daughter closer him, intent upon going in, bonze
 pointed hand him, burst loud fit laughter.
 
gave utterance four lines follow:
 
indulge tender daughter laughed inane;
 vain face snow, oh mirror! will evanescent wane,
 festival lanterns gone by, guard 'gainst doom,
 'tis time flames will kindle, fire will consume.
 
shih-yin understood distinctly full import heard; his
 heart still full conjectures. inquire and
 were, heard taoist remark,--"you cannot
 speed together; let us now part company, us will then
 able go business. lapse three ages, i
 shall pei mang mount, waiting you; can, our
 reunion, betake visionary confines great void,
 cancel name stone records."
 
"excellent! first rate!" exclaimed bonze. conclusion of
 words, two men parted, going way, trace
 seen them.
 
"these two men," shih-yin pondered within heart, "must had
 many experiences, really made inquiries of
 them; juncture indulge regret anyhow late."
 
shih-yin gave way foolish reflections, suddenly
 noticed arrival penniless scholar, chia surname, hua by
 name, shih-fei style yü-ts'un nickname, taken his
 quarters gourd temple next door. chia yü-ts'un was
 originally denizen hu-chow, also literary official
 parentage, born youngest stock, possessions
 paternal maternal ancestors completely exhausted, and
 parents relatives dead, remained sole only
 survivor; and, found residence native place no
 avail, therefore entered capital search reputation,
 enable put family estate proper standing. he
 arrived place since year last, had, is
 more, lived along straitened circumstances. made the
 temple temporary quarters, earned living daily occupying
 composing documents writing letters customers. thus
 shih-yin constant relations him.
 
soon yü-ts'un perceived shih-yin, lost time saluting him.
 "my worthy sir," observed forced smile; "how are
 leaning door looking out? perchance news
 astir streets, public places?"
 
"none whatever," replied shih-yin, returned smile. "just a
 back, young daughter sobs, coaxed to
 amuse her. just now without anything whatever attend to, so
 that, dear brother chia, come just nick time. please walk
 mean abode, let us endeavour, other's company, to
 away long summer day."
 
made remark, bade servant take daughter in,
 he, hand-in-hand yü-ts'un, walked library, a
 young page served tea. hardly exchanged sentences, when
 one household came in, flying haste, announce mr. yen
 come pay visit.
 
shih-yin stood up. "pray excuse rudeness," remarked
 apologetically, "but sit down; shall shortly rejoin you, enjoy
 pleasure society." "my dear sir," answered yü-ts'un, he
 got up, also conceding way, "suit convenience. often
 honour guest, will matter wait a
 little?" apologies yet spoken, shih-yin had
 already walked front parlour. absence, yü-ts'un
 occupied turning pages poetical work to
 dispel ennui, suddenly heard, outside window, woman's
 cough. yü-ts'un hurriedly got looked out. saw glance that
 servant girl engaged picking flowers. deportment out
 common; eyes bright, eyebrows well defined. though
 perfect beauty, possessed nevertheless charms sufficient to
 arouse feelings. yü-ts'un unwittingly gazed fixed eye.
 waiting-maid, belonging chen family, done picking
 flowers, point going in, sudden raised
 eyes became aware presence person inside the
 window, whose head-gear consisted turban tatters, his
 clothes worse wear. spite poverty, was
 naturally endowed round waist, broad back, fat face, square
 mouth; added this, eyebrows swordlike, eyes resembled
 stars, nose straight, cheeks square.
 
servant girl turned away hurry made escape.
 
"this man burly strong," communed within herself, "yet the
 time got poor attire, must, expect, one else
 man, whose name chia yü-ts'un like, time time
 referred master, repeatedly wished give a
 helping hand, failed find favourable opportunity. as
 related family connexion friend straits, i
 feel certain person he. strange say, my
 master remarked man will, certainty, not
 always continue state destitution."
 
indulged train thought, restrain herself
 turning head round twice.
 
yü-ts'un perceived looked back, readily interpreted
 sign heart thoughts him, was
 frantic irrepressible joy.
 
"this girl," mused, "is, doubt, keen-eyed eminently shrewd,
 one world seen me."
 
servant youth, short time, came room; when
 yü-ts'un made inquiries found guests the
 front parlour detained dinner, well wait
 longer, promptly walked away side passage a
 back door.
 
guests taken leave, shih-yin go back to
 rejoin yü-ts'un, come know already left.
 
time mid-autumn festivities drew near; shih-yin, the
 family banquet over, separate table laid library, and
 crossed over, moonlight, far temple invited
 yü-ts'un come round.
 
fact yü-ts'un, ever since day seen the
 girl chen family turn twice round glance him, flattered
 friendly disposed towards him, incessantly
 fostered fond thoughts heart. day, which
 happened mid-autumn feast, not, gazed the
 moon, refrain cherishing remembrance. hence gave
 vent pentameter verses:
 
alas! yet divined lifelong wish,
 anguish ceaseless comes upon anguish
 came, sad heart, brow frowned;
 went, oft head look turned round.
 facing breeze, shadow doth watch,
 meet moonlight night match?
 lustrous rays wish read
 soon alight upon beauteous head!
 
yü-ts'un having, recitation, recalled mind that
 throughout lifetime literary attainments adverse fate
 met opportunity (of reaping distinction), went rub
 brow, raised eyes skies, heaved deep sigh
 intoned couplet aloud:
 
gem cask high price seeks,
 pin case take wing waits.
 
luck it, shih-yin moment approaching, upon
 hearing lines, said smile: "my dear yü-ts'un, really your
 attainments ordinary capacity."
 
yü-ts'un lost time smiling replying. "it presumption
 part think so," observed. "i simply random humming a
 verses composed former writers, reason laud
 excessive degree? what, dear sir, owe the
 pleasure visit?" went inquire. "tonight," replied
 shih-yin, "is mid-autumn feast, generally known full-moon
 festival; help thinking living, worthy
 brother are, mere stranger buddhist temple, not
 experience feeling loneliness. have, express
 purpose, prepared small entertainment, will pleased will
 come mean abode glass wine. wonder whether you
 will entertain favourably modest invitation?" yü-ts'un, after
 listening proposal, put forward refusal sort; but
 remarked complacently: "being recipient marked attention,
 can presume repel generous consideration?"
 
gave expression words, walked then, in
 company shih-yin, came court front
 library. minutes, tea over.
 
cups dishes laid early hour, needless to
 say wines luscious; fare sumptuous.
 
two friends took seats. first leisurely replenished
 glasses, quietly sipped wine; as, little little,
 entered conversation, good cheer grew genial, and
 unawares glasses began fly round, cups exchanged.
 
hour, every house neighbourhood, sounded fife
 lute, inmates indulged music singing. head,
 orb radiant moon shone all-pervading splendour, and
 steady lustrous light, two friends, exuberance
 increased, drained cups dry soon reached lips.
 
yü-ts'un, stage collation, considerably the
 influence wine, vehemence high spirits was
 irrepressible. gazed moon, fostered thoughts, which
 gave vent recital double couplet.
 
'tis time three meets five, selene globe!
 pure rays fill court, jadelike rails enrobe!
 lo! heavens disk view doth now arise,
 earth gaze men lift eyes.
 
"excellent!" cried shih-yin loud voice, heard these
 lines; "i repeatedly maintained impossible to
 remain long inferior any, now verses recited a
 prognostic rapid advancement. already evident that, before
 long, will extend footsteps far clouds! must
 congratulate you! must congratulate you! let me, hands,
 pour glass wine pay compliments."
 
yü-ts'un drained cup. "what say," explained he
 suddenly heaved sigh, "is maudlin talk man the
 effects wine. far subjects present set the
 examinations go, could, perchance, also well able enter
 list, send name candidate; have, just now,
 means whatever make provision luggage travelling
 expenses. distance shen ching long one, not
 depend upon sale papers composition essays find the
 means getting there."
 
shih-yin gave time conclude. "why speak this
 sooner?" interposed haste. "i long entertained this
 suspicion; as, whenever met you, conversation never
 broached, presume make officious. the
 state affairs just now, lack, admit, literary qualification, but
 two subjects friendly spirit pecuniary means, have,
 nevertheless, experience. moreover, rejoice next year is
 just season triennial examinations, start for
 capital despatch; tripos next spring, will,
 carrying prize, able justice proficiency can
 boast of. regards travelling expenses items, the
 provision everything necessary self will not
 render nugatory mean acquaintance me."
 
forthwith, directed servant lad go pack fifty
 taels pure silver two suits winter clothes.
 
"the nineteenth," continued, "is propitious day, should
 lose time hiring boat starting journey westwards.
 when, eminent talents, shall soared high lofty
 position, meet next winter, will occasion be
 extremely felicitous?"
 
yü-ts'un accepted money clothes scanty expression of
 gratitude. fact, paid thought whatever gifts, went
 on, drinking wine, chattered laughed.
 
third watch day already struck the
 two friends parted company; shih-yin, seeing yü-ts'un off,
 retired room slept, one sleep through, never waking
 sun well skies.
 
remembering occurrence previous night, meant write a
 couple letters recommendation yü-ts'un take along him
 capital, enable him, handing mansions

 accordingly despatched servant ask come round, man

shih-yin hearing message alternative banish the
 subject thoughts.
 
comfortable circumstances, time indeed goes easy stride. soon
 drew near also happy festival 15th 1st moon, and
 shih-yin told servant huo ch'i take ying lien see the

middle night, huo ch'i hard pressed, he
 forthwith set ying lien doorstep certain house. he
 felt relieved, came back take up, failed find anywhere

 search throughout half night; even dawn day, had
 discovered clue whereabouts. huo ch'i, lacking, the
 hand, courage go back face master, promptly made
 escape native village.
 
shih-yin--in fact, husband well wife--seeing their
 child come home whole night, readily concluded that
 mishap must befallen her. hastily despatched several
 servants go search her, one returned report that
 neither vestige tidings her.
 
couple child, meridian their

 acquiring fallow land dilapidated house.

 while, others, behind back, contrary expressed
 indignation improvidence mode living, and
 sole delight eating playing lazy.
 
shih-yin, aware want harmony father-in-law, not
 help giving way, heart, feelings regret pain. in
 addition this, fright vexation undergone the
 year before, anguish suffering (he endure), had
 already worked havoc (on constitution); man advanced in
 years, assailed joint attack poverty disease, at
 length gradually began display symptoms decline.
 
strange coincidence, he, day, came leaning staff and
 considerable strain, far street little relaxation,
 suddenly caught sight, approaching side, taoist
 priest crippled foot; maniac appearance repulsive, his
 shoes straw, dress tatters, muttering several sentiments
 effect:
 
men spiritual life know good,
 fame disregard ne'er succeed!
 old till now statesmen they?
 waste lie graves, heap grass, extinct.
 men spiritual life know good,
 forget gold, silver, ill succeed!
 life grudge hoardings scant,
 plenty come, eyelids close.
 men spiritual life hold good,
 yet forget wives, maids, ne'er succeed!
 speak grateful love lives lord,
 dead lord, another pursue.
 men spiritual life know good,
 sons grandsons forget never succeed!
 old till now parents soft many,
 filial sons grandsons seen?
 
shih-yin upon hearing words, hastily came priest, "what
 glibly holding forth?" inquired. "all hear a
 lot hao liao (excellent, finality.")
 
"you may well heard two words 'hao liao,'" answered taoist
 smile, "but can said fathomed meaning? you
 know things world excellent, have
 attained finality; attained finality, excellent;
 attained finality, excellent; if
 excellent, attain finality. song is
 entitled excellent-finality (hao liao)."
 
shih-yin gifted natural perspicacity enabled him, as
 soon heard remarks, grasp spirit.
 
"wait while," therefore said smilingly; "let unravel this
 excellent-finality song yours; mind?"
 
"please means go interpretation," urged taoist;
 whereupon shih-yin proceeded strain:
 
sordid rooms vacant courts,
 replete years gone beds statesmen lay;
 parched grass withered banian trees,
 halls song dance!
 spiders' webs carved pillars intertwine,
 green gauze now also pasted straw windows!
 cosmetic fresh concocted powder just scented;
 hair temple become white like hoarfrost!
 yesterday tumulus yellow earth buried bleached bones,
 to-night red silk curtain reclines couple!
 gold fills coffers, silver fills boxes,
 twinkle, beggars will abuse you!
 deplore life others long,
 forget approaching death!
 educate sons propriety,
 may day, 'tis hard say become thieves;
 though choose (your fare home) fatted beam,

 yesterday, poor fellow, felt cold tattered coat,
 to-day, despise purple embroidered dress long!
 confusion reigns far wide! just sung part, come on
 boards,
 instead yours, recognise another native land;
 utter perversion!
 one word, comes make wedding clothes others!
 (we sow others reap.)
 
crazy limping taoist clapped hands. "your interpretation is
 explicit," remarked hearty laugh, "your interpretation is
 explicit!"
 
shih-yin promptly said nothing than,--"walk on;" seizing the
 stole taoist's shoulder, flung own. not,
 however, return home, leisurely walked away, company the
 eccentric priest.
 
report disappearance bruited abroad, plunged
 whole neighbourhood commotion; converted piece of

"the face officer seem familiar," argued within
 herself; "just seen somewhere ere this."

 desolation void family circle (round knees).
 
proceed. yü-ts'un, sojourning inn, unexpectedly
 laid violent chill. finding recovery, funds
 sufficient pay expenses, thinking looking out
 house find resting place suddenly came
 across two friends acquainted new salt commissioner. knowing
 official desirous find tutor instruct his
 daughter, lost time recommending yü-ts'un, moved the
 yamên.
 
female pupil youthful years delicate physique, that
 lessons irregular. besides herself, two waiting
 girls, remained attendance hours study, that
 yü-ts'un spared considerable trouble suitable opportunity
 attend improvement health.
 
twinkle, another year slipped by, least expected,
 mother ward, née chia, carried away short
 illness. pupil (during mother's sickness) dutiful her
 attendance, prepared medicines use. (and her
 death,) went deepest mourning prescribed rites, and
 gave way excess grief that, naturally delicate was,
 old complaint, account, broke anew.
 
unable considerable time prosecute studies, yü-ts'un
 lived leisure duties attend to. whenever therefore the
 wind genial sun mild, wont stroll random, after
 done meals.
 
particular day, he, accident, extended walk beyond
 suburbs, desirous contemplate nature rustic
 scenery, he, listless step, came spot encircled hills
 streaming pools, luxuriant clumps trees thick groves of
 bamboos. nestling dense foliage stood temple. doors and
 courts ruins. walls, inner outer, disrepair. an
 inscription tablet testified temple spiritual
 perception. sides door also pair old and
 dilapidated scrolls following enigmatical verses.
 
behind ample is, yet retract hand, mind heeds not,

 mortal vision lies path, comes turn will.
 
"these two sentences," yü-ts'un pondered perusal, "although simple
 language, profound signification. previous this
 visited many spacious temple, located hills note, never have
 beheld inscription referring anything kind. meaning
 contained words must, feel certain, owe origin the
 experiences person other; saying. why
 go inquire myself?"
 
upon walking in, glance caught sight one else, a
 aged bonze, unkempt appearance, cooking rice. yü-ts'un
 perceived paid notice, went asked one or
 two questions, old priest dull hearing dotard,
 lost teeth, tongue blunt, made most
 irrelevant replies.
 
yü-ts'un lost patience him, withdrew the
 compound intention going far village public house
 drink two, enhance enjoyment rustic
 scenery. easy stride, accordingly walked place.
 scarcely passed threshold public house, he
 perceived one among visitors sitting
 sipping wine divan, jump come greet him, with
 face beaming laughter.
 
"what strange meeting! strange meeting!" exclaimed aloud.
 
yü-ts'un speedily looked him, (and remembered) person had,
 past days, carried business curio establishment the
 capital, surname leng style tzu-hsing.
 
mutual friendship existed sojourn, in
 days yore, capital; yü-ts'un entertained the
 highest opinion leng tzu-hsing, man action great
 abilities, leng tzu-hsing, hand, borrowed the
 reputation refinement enjoyed yü-ts'un, two consequently
 along lived perfect harmony companionship.
 
"when get here?" yü-ts'un eagerly inquired also smilingly. "i
 least aware arrival. unexpected meeting is
 positively strange piece good fortune."
 
"i went home," tzu-hsing replied, "about close last year, now
 bound capital, passed way to
 look friend mine talk matters over. kindness
 press stay couple days longer, after
 urgent business attend to, tarrying days, but
 purpose starting middle moon. friend busy to-day,
 roamed listlessly far here, never dreaming a
 fortunate meeting."
 
speaking, made yü-ts'un sit table, ordered
 fresh supply wine eatables; two friends chatted of
 one thing another, slowly sipped wine.
 
conversation ran occurred separation, and
 yü-ts'un inquired, "is news kind capital?"
 
"there's nothing new whatever," answered tzu-hsing. "there one thing
 however: family one worthy kinsmen, name
 yourself, trifling, yet remarkable, occurrence taken
 place."
 
"none kindred reside capital," rejoined yü-ts'un a
 smile. "to can alluding?"
 
"how can people surname belong
 one clan?" remarked tzu-hsing, sarcastically.
 
"in whose family?" inquired yü-ts'un.
 
"the chia family," replied tzu-hsing smiling, "whose quarters the
 jung kuo mansion, reflect discredit upon lintel
 door, venerable friend."
 
"what!" exclaimed yü-ts'un, "did affair take place family?
 begin reckoning, find members clan be
 anything limited number. since time ancestor chia fu,
 lived eastern dynasty occupied throne, the
 branches family numerous flourishing; now
 found every single province, could, accuracy,
 ascertain whereabouts? regards jung-kuo branch in
 particular, names fact inscribed register as
 own, rich exalted are, never presumed to
 claim relatives, become more
 estranged."
 
"don't make assertions," tzu-hsing remarked sigh, "the
 present two mansions jung ning alike also suffered
 reverses, come state days yore."
 
"up day, two households ning jung," yü-ts'un
 suggested, "still maintain large retinue people, can
 met reverses?"
 
"to explain indeed long story," said leng tzu-hsing.
 "last year," continued yü-ts'un, "i arrived chin ling, i
 entertained wish visit remains interest six
 dynasties, day entered walled town shih t'ou, i
 passed entrance old residence. east side the
 street, stood ning kuo mansion; west jung kuo mansion;
 two, adjoining do, cover fact well-nigh
 half whole length street. outside front gate
 everything was, true, lonely deserted; glance into
 interior enclosing wall, perceived halls,
 pavilions, two-storied structures porches presented still majestic
 lofty appearance. even flower garden, extends the
 whole area back grounds, trees rockeries, also
 possessed day air luxuriance freshness, betrayed
 signs ruined decrepid establishment."
 
"you good fortune starting life graduate,"
 explained tzu-tsing smiled, "and yet aware saying
 uttered one old: centipede even dead lie
 stiff. (these families) may, according version, the
 prosperity former years, but, compared family ordinary
 official, condition anyhow presents difference. late the
 number inmates has, day day, increase; their
 affairs become daily numerous; masters servants, high
 low, live ease respectability many are; of
 exercise forethought, make provision, not
 even one. daily wants, extravagances, their
 expenditure, also unable adapt circumstances
 practise economy; (so though) present external framework
 may suffered considerable collapse, purses have
 anyhow begun feel exhausting process! mere trifle.
 another serious matter. one ever believe in
 families official status, clan education culture,
 sons grandsons present age each
 (succeeding) generation standard former?"
 
yü-ts'un, listened remarks, observed: "how ever can it
 possible families education refinement can observe
 system training nurture excellent? concerning
 branches, position say anything; but
 restricting two mansions jung ning, those
 which, others, education children is
 methodical."
 
"i just now alluding none two establishments,"
 tzu-hsing observed sigh; "but let tell all. days of
 yore, duke ning kuo duke jung kuo two uterine
 brothers. ning duke elder; four sons. death
 duke ning kuo, eldest son, chia tai-hua, came the
 title. also two sons; eldest, whose name hu, died at
 age eight nine; survivor, second son, chia

 happily, had, early age, left son, chia chen, behind the
 lay world, father, engrossed whole heart the

 title him. parent is, besides, willing return the
 original family seat, lives outside walls capital,
 foolishly hobnobbing taoist priests. mr. chen also

 now, came manner. demise jung duke, the

 favour, conferred upon mr. cheng brevet rank second class
 assistant secretary (of board), commanded enter board

 office second class secretary. mr. cheng's wife, nèe wang,
 first gave birth called chia chu, became licentiate in
 fourteenth year. barely twenty, married, fell ill died

 daughter, came world, strange coincidence, the
 first day year. unexpected (pleasure) birth,
 succeeding year, another son, who, still remarkable say,
 had, time birth, piece variegated crystal-like
 brilliant jade mouth, yet visible outlines of
 several characters. now, tell me, novel strange
 occurrence? eh?"
 
"strange indeed!" exclaimed yü-ts'un smile; "but presume the
 coming experiences will mean."
 
tzu-hsing gave faint smile. "one all," remarked, "entertain the
 idea. hence mother doats upon like upon a
 precious jewel. day first birthday, mr. cheng readily
 entertained wish put bent inclinations test, and
 placed child kinds things, without number, to

yü-ts'un, whose countenance suddenly assumed stern air, promptly
 interrupted conversation. "it quite follow," suggested.
 "you people don't, regret say, understand destiny this

tzu-hsing upon perceiving weighty import propounded,
 "please explain," asked hastily, "the drift (of argument)." to
 yü-ts'un responded: "of human beings created operation

outward appearance may pleasing highest degree, but
 yet easy matter fathom lay beneath it.

roundelays run follows:

"you gone changed clothes," observed dowager lady chia,
 "before introduced distant guest. yet salute

two arched eyebrows, thick clustered smoke, bore certain not
 pronounced frowning wrinkle. pair eyes, which
 possessed cheerful, yet one say, sad expression,
 overflowing sentiment. face showed prints sorrow stamped
 two dimpled cheeks. beautiful, whole frame was

 lovely flower reflected water. gait resembled frail willow,

pao-yü, concluded scrutiny her, put smile said,
 "this cousin already seen days gone by."
 
"there nonsense," exclaimed lady chia,
 sneeringly; "how seen before?"
 
"though may seen her, ere this," observed pao-yü a
 smirk, "yet look face, seems familiar, my
 mind, appear old acquaintances; just if,
 fact, now meeting long separation."
 
"that will do! will do!" remarked dowager lady chia; "such being
 case, will intimate."
 
pao-yü, thereupon, went tai-yü, taking seat next her,
 continued look intentness good long
 while.
 
"have read books, cousin?" asked.
 
"i yet," replied tai-yü, "read books, been

"what worthy name, cousin?" pao-yü went ask; whereupon
 tai-yü speedily told name.
 
"your style?" inquired pao-yü; question tai-yü replied, "i have

"i'll give style," suggested pao-yü smilingly; "won't double
 style 'p'in p'in,' 'knitting brows,' well?"
 
"from part standard books come?" t'an ch'un
 hastily interposed.
 
"it stated thorough research state creation from
 remote ages present day," pao-yü went explain, "that, in
 western quarter, exists stone, called tai, (black,) which
 can used, lieu ink, blacken eyebrows with. besides the
 eyebrows cousin taper way, contracted, so
 selection two characters appropriate, isn't
 it?"
 
"this just another plagiarism, fear," observed t'an ch'un, an
 ironic smirk.
 
"exclusive four books," pao-yü remarked smilingly, "the majority
 works plagiarised; i, perchance, plagiarise?
 got jade not?" went inquire, addressing tai-yü,
 (to discomfiture) make meant.
 
"it's jade himself," tai-yü forthwith reasoned within
 mind, "that asks whether one not.--no; haven't
 one," replied. "that jade besides rare object, how
 every one one?"
 
soon pao-yü heard remark, burst fit of
 raving complaint, unclasping gem, dashed disdainfully
 floor. "rare object, indeed!" shouted, heaped invective
 it; "it idea discriminate excellent mean,
 among human beings; tell me, perception not? too
 can without rubbish!"
 
those, stood below, startled; body pressed
 forward, vying pick gem.
 
dowager lady chia distressed clasped pao-yü her
 embrace. "you child wrath," exclaimed. "when get a
 passion, easy enough beat abuse people; what
 makes fling away stem life?"
 
pao-yü's face covered traces tears. "all cousins
 here, senior well junior," rejoined, sobbed, "have no
 gem, one, fun it, maintain!
 now comes angelic sort cousin, none, that
 clear enough profitable thing."
 
dowager lady chia hastened coax him. "this cousin yours," she
 explained, "would, former circumstances, come a
 jade; aunt felt unable, lay her
 death-bed, reconcile separation cousin, that
 absence remedy, forthwith took gem belonging to

 place, fulfilment rites burying living the

 second place, spirit aunt might also, time

uttered words, speedily took jade the
 hand waiting-maid, fastened him.
 
pao-yü heard explanation, indulged reflection, could
 even advance arguments.
 
nurse came moment inquired tai-yü's quarters, and
 dowager lady chia added, "shift pao-yü along me, the
 warm room suite apartments, put mistress, miss lin,
 temporarily green gauze house; rest winter is
 over, repairs taken hand spring rooms, an
 additional wing can put take quarters in."
 
"my dear ancestor," ventured pao-yü; "the bed occupy outside green

"well, right," observed dowager lady chia, consideration;
 "but let one nurse, well waiting-maid to
 attend you; servants can remain outside rooms and
 keep night watch ready answer call."
 
early hour, besides, hsi-feng sent servant round grey
 flowered curtain, embroidered coverlets satin quilts such

tai-yü brought along two servants; one own
 nurse, dame wang, young waiting-maid sixteen,
 whose name called hsüeh yen. dowager lady chia, perceiving that
 hsüeh yen youthful quite child manner, nurse
 wang was, hand, aged, conjectured tai-yü would, in
 wants, things liked, detached two
 waiting-maids, personal attendants, named tzu chüan and
 ying ko, attached tai-yü's service. just ying ch'un

pao-yü, knowing surname one time hua, once

 dowager lady chia, changed name hsi jen.
 
hsi jen several simple traits. attendance upon dowager
 lady chia, heart eyes one venerable
 ladyship, alone; now attendance upon pao-yü, her
 heart eyes full pao-yü, alone. as
 pao-yü perverse temperament heed repeated
 injunctions, felt heart exceedingly grieved.
 
night, nurse li fallen asleep, seeing inner
 chambers, tai-yü, ying ko others yet retired rest,
 disrobed herself, gentle step walked in.
 
"how it, miss," inquired smiling, "that turned as

tai-yü put smile. "sit down, sister," rejoined,
 pressing take seat. hsi jen sat edge bed.
 
"miss lin," interposed ying ko smirkingly, "has awful

"what sisters advise me," replied tai-yü, "i shall bear mind, and

yü-ts'un had, promptitude, servants plaintiffs
 brought him, subjected examination.
 
"the victim assault," plaintiffs deposed, "was servants'
 master. certain day, purchased servant-girl, she
 unexpectedly turned girl carried away sold
 kidnapper. kidnapper had, first all, got hold our

yü-ts'un heard appeal, flew fiery rage. "what!" he
 exclaimed. "how case gravity taken place the
 murder man, culprits allowed run away
 scot-free, without arrested? issue warrants, despatch
 constables lay hold relatives bloodstained
 criminals bring examined means torture."
 
thereupon espied retainer, standing judgment-table,
 wink him, signifying issue warrants. yü-t'sun
 gave way secret suspicion, felt compelled desist.
 
withdrawing court-room, retired private chamber, from
 whence dismissed followers, keeping single retainer to
 wait upon him.
 
retainer speedily advanced paid obeisance. "your worship,"
 said smiling, "has persistently rising official honours, and
 increasing wealth that, course eight nine
 years, forgotten me."
 
"your face is, however, extremely familiar," observed yü-ts'un, "but i

"honourable people forget many things," remarked retainer, he
 smiled. "what! even forgotten place started in
 life? remember occurred, years gone by, hu

yü-ts'un filled extreme astonishment; past events then
 began dawn upon him.
 
fact retainer one time young priest in

 kind occupation, unable reconcile the
 solitude quiet temple, accordingly availed his
 years, yet few, let hair grow, become a

 pressed take seat, chat ease, the

"friendships," yü-ts'un remarked, putting smiling expression,
 "contracted poor circumstances forgotten! a
 private room; sat down, matter?"
 
retainer thereupon craved permission take seat, sat down
 gingerly, awry.
 
"why you, short back," yü-ts'un inquired, "not allow to
 issue warrants?"
 
"your illustrious office," replied retainer, "has brought your
 worship here, likely transcribed philactery
 post province!"
 
"what office-philactery?" asked yü-ts'un alacrity.
 
"now-a-days," explained retainer, "those become local officers

uttered words, produced, inside purse had

 follows:

scarcely yü-ts'un done reading, suddenly heard the

"these four families," explained retainer, "are interlaced by

"i deceive worship," retainer ventured smiling, "when i

"how possibly know?" answered yü-ts'un.
 
"and yet," remarked retainer, laughed coldly, "this a

"what! really she?" exclaimed yü-ts'un full surprise. "i heard
 kidnapped, ever since five years old; has

"kidnappers kind," continued retainer, "only abduct infant

 kidnapper happened intoxicated, ying lien exclaimed, she
 sighed: 'my punishment day consummated!' later again,
 heard young feng would, three days, taken

"but believe world full disappointments! on

yü-ts'un heard account also heaved sigh. "this was

"this ying lien had, years, endure much harsh

"what suggest," replied yü-ts'un, "is, course, right enough; but

yü-ts'un drooped head considerable time.
 
"what idea done?" length inquired.
 
"your servant," responded retainer, "has already devised most

 heard maternal uncle, wang tzu-t'eng, raised the

hsüeh p'an heart secretly elated. "i just lamenting," he
 thought, "that visit capital, maternal

consequently held consultation mother; "though have,"
 argued, "several houses capital, yet last
 ten years so, one live them, people
 charged looking must unavoidably stealthily
 rented one other. therefore needful let servants

 well go ourselves."
 
"what need go trouble?" retorted mother; "the
 main object present visit capital first pay

 saving trouble?"
 
"my uncle, brother," suggested hsüeh p'an, "has just raised to
 appointment outside province, that, course, house,
 things must topsy-turvey, account departure; we
 betake ourselves, like hive bees long trail, for
 shelter; appear inconsiderate?"
 
"your uncle," remarked mother, "is, true, going promotion,

hsüeh p'an, upon hearing mother speak strain, knew well
 enough bring round determination; he
 help issue necessary directions servants to

 already come know lawsuit, hsüeh p'an was
 concerned, chia yü-ts'un fortunately intervened lent good

 saw eldest brother advanced post frontier,
 just deploring that, deprived intercourse the
 relatives mother's family, doubly lonely feel;
 when, lapse days, one household brought
 unexpected announcement "our lady, sister, has, the
 young gentleman, young lady whole household, entered the
 capital dismounted vehicles outside main
 entrance." news delighted madame wang rushed out, with
 attendants, greet large entrance hall, brought
 mrs. hsüeh others house.
 
two sisters now reunited, advanced period lives,
 mixed feelings sorrow joy thronged together, these
 is, course, needless dilate.
 
conversing time occurred, subsequent their
 separation, madame wang took pay obeisance dowager lady
 chia. handed various kinds presents indigenous
 articles, whole family introduced, banquet was
 also spread greet guests.
 
hsüeh p'an, paid respects chia cheng chia lien, was
 likewise taken see chia she, chia chen members.
 
chia cheng sent messenger tell madame wang "'aunt' hsüeh had
 already seen many springs autumns, nephew tender

madame wang fact entertaining wish keep live

mrs. hsüeh along desirous live one place with

fourth chapter explained, degree, the
 circumstances attending settlement mother children the

ever since arrival jung mansion, dowager lady chia showed her
 highest sympathy affection, everything connected with
 sleeping, eating, rising accommodation footing

 three granddaughters, take back seat. fact,
 intimate close friendliness love sprung the
 two persons pao-yü tai-yü, was, degree, an
 exceptional kind, compared existing others. by
 daylight wont walk together, sit together. night,
 desist together, rest together. really case of
 harmony language concord ideas, consistency varnish
 glue, (a close friendship), unexpected juncture there
 came girl, hsüeh pao-ch'ai, who, though much older in
 years (than others), was, nevertheless, manner correct, in
 features beautiful consensus opinion tai-yü
 come standard.
 
more, ways pao-ch'ai full good tact, so
 considerate accommodating, unlike tai-yü, supercilious,
 self-confident, without regard world below, the
 natural consequence soon completely won hearts the
 lower classes. even whole number waiting-maids also the
 part, play joke pao-ch'ai. hence tai-yü
 fostered, heart, considerable feelings resentment, this
 however pao-ch'ai least inkling.
 
pao-yü was, likewise, prime boyhood, was, besides, as
 far bent natural disposition concerned, every
 respect absurd perverse; regarding cousins, whether male or
 female, one one common sentiment, without any
 distinction whatever degrees distant close
 relationship. sitting sleeping, now roof
 tai-yü dowager lady chia's suite rooms, naturally became
 comparatively friendly cousins; and
 friendliness led greater intimacy intimacy once
 established, rendered unavoidable occurrence blight of
 harmony unforeseen slight pretexts.
 
two day, unknown reason, words
 less unfriendly, tai-yü sitting all
 alone room, giving way tears. pao-yü within
 quite conscience-smitten ungraceful remarks, coming
 forward, humbly made advances, until, length, tai-yü little by
 little came round.
 
plum blossom, eastern part garden ning

 preparations collation, (purposing) send invitations dowager
 lady chia, mesdames hsing, wang, members the

 come ask round person. dowager lady chia other
 inmates crossed early meal; promenaded

 next wine; entertainment family banquet of
 kindred two mansions ning jung, a
 total lack novel original recreation put on
 record.
 
little time, pao-yü felt tired languid inclined his
 midday siesta. "take good care," dowager lady chia enjoined of
 them, "and stay him, rests while, can come
 back;" whereupon chia jung's wife, mrs. ch'in, smiled said with
 eagerness: "we got ready room uncle pao, let your
 venerable ladyship set mind ease. just hand my
 charge, will quite safe. mothers sisters," continued,
 addressing pao-yü's nurses waiting maids, "invite uncle
 pao follow here."
 
dowager lady chia always aware fact mrs. ch'in was
 trustworthy person, naturally courteous scrupulous, in
 every action likewise benign gentle; indeed estimable
 among whole number great grandsons' wives, she
 saw go attend pao-yü, felt that, a
 certainty, everything well.
 
mrs. ch'in, then, led away company attendants, came
 rooms inside drawing room. pao-yü, upon raising head,
 catching sight picture hung upper wall, representing a
 human figure, perfect style, subject portrait of
 yen li, speedily felt heart sink within him.
 
also pair scrolls, text was:
 
thorough insight worldly matters arises knowledge;
 clear perception human nature emanates literary lore.
 
perusal two sentences, albeit room sumptuous and
 beautifully laid out, account remain it. "let us go at
 once," hastened observe, "let us go once."
 
mrs. ch'in upon hearing objections smiled. "if this," said, "is
 really nice, going? remain here, well
 come room."
 
pao-yü nodded head gave faint grin.
 
"where find propriety," nurse thereupon interposed, "of an
 uncle going sleep room nephew's wife?"
 
"ai ya!" exclaimed mrs. ch'in laughing, "i mind whether gets
 angry (at say); old can reverentially
 shun things? brother last month;
 see him? he's, true enough, age uncle pao, but
 two stand side side, suspect be
 much higher stature."
 
"how it," asked pao-yü, "that see him? bring along and
 let look him!"
 
"he's separated," ventured laughed, "by distance of
 twenty thirty li, can brought along? see him
 day."
 
talking, reached interior mrs. ch'in's
 apartments. soon got in, faint puff sweet fragrance
 wafted nostrils. pao-yü readily felt eyes itch and
 bones grow weak. "what fine smell!" exclaimed several
 consecutive times.
 
upon entering apartments, gazing partition wall, saw a
 picture handiwork t'ang po-hu, consisting begonias drooping in
 spring time; either side one pair scrolls,
 written ch'in tai-hsü, literary chancellor sung era, running
 follows:
 
gentle chill doth circumscribe dreaming man, spring
 cold.
 fragrant whiff, wafts man's nose, perfume
 wine!
 
table mirror, one placed, days yore,
 mirror palace emperor wu tse-t'ien. one side stood a
 gold platter, fei yen, lived ch'ao state, used to
 stand dance. platter, laid quince, lu-shan
 flung empress t'ai chen, inflicting wound breast. in
 upper part room, stood divan ornamented gems, which
 emperor's daughter, shou ch'ang, wont sleep, chang
 palace hanging, curtains embroidered strings pearls, by
 t'ung ch'ang, imperial princess.
 
"it's nice here, nice here," exclaimed pao-yü chuckle.
 
"this room mine," observed mrs. ch'in smilingly, "is think, good
 enough even spirits live in!" and, uttered words,
 hands, opened gauze coverlet, washed
 hsi shih, removed bridal pillow, held the
 arms hung niang. instantly, nurses attended pao-yü, he
 laid comfortably; quietly dispersed, leaving the
 four waiting maids: hsi jen, ch'iu wen, ch'ing wen yueh keep
 company.
 
"mind careful, sit eaves," mrs. ch'in recommended
 young waiting maids, "that cats start fight!"
 
pao-yü closed eyes, and, little little, became drowsy, and
 fell asleep.
 
seemed just mrs. ch'in walking ahead him.
 forthwith, listless unsettled step, followed mrs. ch'in to
 spot other, saw carnation-like railings, jade-like
 steps, verdant trees limpid pools--a spot actually trace of
 human met with, shifting mundane dust
 little penetrated.
 
pao-yü felt, dream, quite delighted. "this place," mused, "is
 pleasant, may well spend whole lifetime here! though i
 may lose home, quite ready sacrifice, it's
 far better flogged, day day, father,
 mother, teacher."
 
pondered erratic strain, suddenly heard voice of
 human back rocks, giving vent song:
 
like scattering clouds doth fleet vernal dream;
 transient flowers pass like running stream;
 maidens youths bear this, ye all, mind;
 useless grief profit will ye find?
 
pao-yü perceived voice girl. song barely
 end, soon espied opposite direction, beautiful
 girl advancing majestic elastic step; girl quite unlike any
 ordinary mortal being. poem, gives adequate
 description her:
 
just quits willow bank; sudden now issues the
 flower-bedecked house;
 onward alone speeds, startles birds perched the
 trees, pavilion; draws nigh, shadow
 flits verandah!
 fairy clothes now flutter wind! fragrant perfume like

 sudden wont move; jingle ornaments strikes the
 ear.
 dimpled cheeks resemble, smile, vernal peach; her
 kingfisher coiffure like cumulus clouds; lips part
 cherry-like; pomegranate-like teeth conceal fragrant
 breath.
 slender waist, beauteous look at, like skipping snow
 wafted gust wind; sheen pearls kingfisher
 trinkets abounds splendour, green feathers duck,
 yellow plumes goose;
 now issues view, now hidden among flowers; beautiful
 displeased, beautiful high spirits; with
 lissome step, treads along pond, soars wings
 sways air.
 eyebrows crescent moons, knit smiles; she
 speaks, yet seems word utter; lotus-like feet
 ease pursue course; stops, yet seems still
 motion; charms figure vie ice in
 purity, splendour precious gems; lovely her
 brilliant attire, full grandeur refined grace.
 loveable countenance, moulded fragrant substance,
 carved white jade; elegant person, like phoenix,
 dignified like dragon soaring high.
 chastity like? like white plum spring snow
 nestling broken skin; purity? like autumn orchids
 bedecked dewdrops.
 modesty? like fir-tree growing barren plain; her
 comeliness? like russet clouds reflected limpid pool.
 gracefulness? like dragon motion wriggling stream;
 refinement? like rays moon shooting cool

 blush! remarkable person! born? whence

 one thing true fairy-land second like her! that
 purple courts heaven one fit peer!
 forsooth, can be, surpassingly beautiful!
 
pao-yü, upon realising fairy, much elated; with
 eagerness advanced made bow.
 
"my divine sister," ventured, put smile. "i know
 whence come, whither going. idea what
 place is, make bold entreat take hand
 lead on."
 
"my abode," replied fairy, "is heavens divested
 animosities, ocean discharged sorrows. fairy of
 monitory vision, cave drooping fragrance, mount of

 supervise dusty world, envies women lusts man.

pao-yü, proposal, felt elated extraordinary degree
 skip joy, discarding mind
 idea mrs. ch'in was, readily followed fairy.
 
reached spot, stone tablet, put a
 horizontal position, visible four large characters:
 "the confines great void," either side one a
 pair scrolls, two antithetical sentences:
 
falsehood stands truth, truth likewise becomes false;
 naught made aught, aught changes naught!
 
past portal stood door palace, horizontally, this
 door, four large characters: "the retribution, the
 heaven love." also pair scrolls, inscription
 large characters:
 
passion, alas! thick earth, lofty skies, ages
 past present hath held incessant sway;
 pitiful lot! ye lustful men women envious, your
 voluptuous debts hard pay!
 
pao-yü, perusal, communed heart. "is really so!"
 thought, "but wonder implies passion old till now,
 voluptuous debts! henceforward, must enlighten
 myself!"
 
pao-yü bent upon train thoughts unwittingly
 attracted several evil spirits heart, speedy step he
 followed track fairy, entered two rows doors when
 perceived lateral halls were, sides, full tablets
 scrolls, number one moment ascertain.
 however discriminated numerous places inscriptions: board
 lustful love; board contracted grudges; board matutinal
 sobs; board nocturnal tears; board vernal affections; and
 board autumnal anguish.
 
perused inscriptions, felt impelled turn round
 address fairy. "may venture trouble fairy," said, "to
 take along turn interior boards? may
 allowed, wonder, so?"
 
"inside boards," explained fairy, "are accumulated the
 registers records women whole world; who
 passed away, well yet come it,
 you, mortal eyes human body, possibly be
 allowed know anything anticipation."
 
pao-yü, upon hearing words, submit decree? he
 went implore permission again, fairy
 casting eye upon tablet board front observed,
 "well, right! may go board reap transient
 pleasure."
 
pao-yü indescribably joyous, and, raised head, he
 perceived text tablet consisted three characters:
 board ill-fated lives; side scroll with
 inscription:
 
upon one's self mainly brought regrets spring autumn gloom;
 face, flowerlike may moonlike too; beauty whom?
 
upon perusal scroll pao-yü was, once, stirred with
 admiration; and, crossed door, reached interior, the
 things struck eye ten large presses, whole
 number sealed paper slips; every one these
 slips, perceived phrases peculiar province.
 
pao-yü mind merely bent upon discerning, rest, the
 slip referring native village, espied, other
 side, slip large characters: "the principal record the
 twelve maidens chin ling."
 
"what meaning," therefore inquired pao-yü, "of principal
 record twelve maidens chin ling?"
 
"as record," explained fairy, "of excellent and
 prominent girls honourable province, is, reason,
 called principal record."
 
"i've often heard people say," observed pao-yü, "that chin ling of
 vast extent; can twelve maidens it! why, at
 present, family alone, less several
 hundreds young girls!"
 
fairy gave faint smile. "through be," rejoined, "so
 large number girls honourable province, any
 note selected entered record. two presses, on
 two sides, contain second best; while, who
 remain, ordinary run, are, consequently, no
 registers make entry in."
 
pao-yü upon looking press below, perceived inscription:
 "secondary record twelve girls chin ling;" in
 another press inscribed: "supplementary secondary record the
 twelve girls chin ling." forthwith stretching hand, pao-yü
 opened first doors press, containing "supplementary
 secondary record," extracted volume registers, opened it.
 came examine it, saw front page representation of
 something, which, though bearing resemblance human being,
 presented, time, similitude scenery; consisting simply
 huge blotches made ink. whole paper full nothing else

reading lines, pao-yü looked below, pictured a
 bouquet fresh flowers bed covered tattered matting. there
 also several distiches running follows:
 
thy self-esteem kindly gentleness fancy vain!
 thy charms can match olea orchid, thoughts inane!

pao-yü perused sentences, unfold meaning, so,
 discarding press, went opened door the
 press "secondary records" took book, which, on
 examination, found representation twig olea fragrans.
 below, pond, water parched mud dry,
 lotus flowers decayed, even roots dead. back were
 lines:
 
lotus root flower one fragrance will give;

pao-yü meaning again, though read lines over, quite
 unintelligible. was, make inquiries, felt convinced

 though intent upon discarding book, however tear

pao-yü still bent upon prosecuting perusal, fairy
 perceiving intellect eminent bright, natural
 talents quickwitted, apprehending lest decrees heaven should
 divulged, hastily closed book record, addressed to
 pao-yü. "come along me," said smiling, "and see wonderful
 scenery. need staying beating gourd of
 ennui?"
 
dazed state, pao-yü listlessly discarded record, again
 followed footsteps fairy. arrival back, he
 saw carnation portières, embroidered curtains, ornamented pillars,
 carved eaves. words can adequately give idea the
 vermilion apartments glistening splendour, floors garnished
 gold, snow reflecting lustrous windows, palatial
 mansions made gems. also saw fairyland flowers, beautiful and
 fragrant, extraordinary vegetation, full perfume. spot was
 indeed elysian.
 
heard fairy observe smiling face: "come of
 greet honoured guest!"
 
words scarcely completed, espied fairies walk of
 mansion, were, dangling lotus sleeves, and
 fluttering feather habiliments, comely spring flowers, and
 winsome autumn moon. soon caught sight pao-yü,
 all, one voice, resentfully reproached monitory vision
 fairy. "ignorant honoured guest be," argued,
 "we hastened come offer greetings simply you,
 elder sister, told us that, day, time,
 sure come visit, spirit younger sister
 chiang chu. reason waiting ever so
 long; now you, lieu her, introduce vile object to
 contaminate confines pure spotless maidens?"
 
soon pao-yü heard remarks, forthwith plunged such
 state consternation retired, found it
 impossible so. fact, felt consciousness foulness
 corruption nature quite intolerable. monitory vision
 fairy promptly took pao-yü's hand own, turning towards her
 younger sisters, smiled explained: "you, you, not
 aware wherefore. to-day mean gone the
 jung mansion fetch chiang chu, went ning mansion, i
 unexpectedly came across ghosts two dukes jung ning,
 addressed wise: 'our family has, since dynasty
 established throne, enjoyed merit fame, pervaded
 many ages, riches honours transmitted generation to
 generation. one hundred years already elapsed, good

 though perverse disposition wayward nature, nevertheless
 intelligent quick-witted qualified measure give effect

"on language addressed me, feelings of
 commiseration naturally burst forth; brought here, bade

 maidens family, belonging three grades, upper,
 middle lower, yet fathomed import, have
 consequently led place experience vision of
 drinking, eating, singing licentious love, hope, no
 saying, length attaining perception."
 
concluded remarks, led pao-yü hand the
 apartment, felt whiff subtle fragrance, was
 reached nostrils tell.
 
pao-yü's eager incessant inquiries, fairy made reply a
 sardonic smile. "this perfume," said, "is found the
 world, discern is? made essence
 first sprouts rare herbs, growing hills fame and
 places superior excellence, admixed oil every species of
 splendid shrubs precious groves, called marrow of
 conglomerated fragrance."
 
words pao-yü was, course, full feeling than
 wonder.
 
whole party advanced took seats, young maidservant
 presented tea, pao-yü found pure aroma, excellent flavour
 ordinary kind. "what name tea?" therefore
 asked; upon fairy explained. "this tea," added,
 "originates hills emitted spring valley drooping
 fragrance, is, besides, brewed night dew, found spiritual
 plants divine leaves. name tea 'one thousand red in
 one hole.'"
 
words pao-yü nodded head, extolled qualities.
 espying room lutes, jasper mountings, tripods, inlaid
 gems, antique paintings, new poetical works, be
 seen everywhere, felt ever high state delight.
 windows, also shreds velvet sputtered a
 toilet case stained traces time smudged cosmetic;
 partition wall likewise suspended pair scrolls,
 inscription:
 
lonesome, small, ethereal, beauteous nook!
 help there, heaven's will brook?
 
pao-yü completed inspection felt full admiration, and
 proceeded ascertain names surnames fairies. one was
 called fairy lustful dreams; another "the high ruler of
 propagated passion;" name one "the golden maiden of
 perpetuated sorrow;" another "intelligent maiden transmitted
 hatred." (in fact,) respective taoist appellations one
 kind.
 
short while, young maid-servants came laid table, put
 chairs places, spread wines eatables. there
 actually crystal tankards overflowing luscious wines, and
 amber glasses full brim pearly strong liquors. still
 less need give details sumptuousness
 refreshments.
 
pao-yü found difficult, account unusual purity the
 bouquet wine, restrain making inquiries
 it.
 
"this wine," observed monitory dream fairy, "is made twigs of
 hundreds flowers, juice ten thousands trees, the
 addition must composed unicorn marrow, yeast prepared with
 phoenix milk. hence name 'ten thousand beauties one cup' was
 given it."
 
pao-yü sang incessant praise, and, sipped wine, twelve

maidens finished ballads, went sing the
 "supplementary record;" monitory vision fairy, perceiving the
 total absence interest pao-yü, heaved sigh. "you silly
 brat!" exclaimed. "what! you, even now, attained
 perception!"
 
"there's need go singing," speedily observed pao-yü, as
 interrupted singing maidens; feeling drowsy dull, he
 pleaded effects wine, begged allowed lie

fairy gave orders clear away remains feast, and
 escorted pao-yü suite female apartments, splendour of
 objects laid thing hitherto

 early period, girl seated room, who, freshness
 beauty winsomeness charms, bore resemblance to
 pao-ch'ai, while, elegance comeliness, hand, to

plunged state perplexity, fairy suddenly
 remarked: "all female apartments ladies' chambers many
 wealthy honourable families world are, without exception,
 polluted voluptuous opulent puppets bevy of
 profligate girls. still despicable old till now
 numberless dissolute roués, one maintain libidinous
 affections constitute lewdness; try, further, prove
 licentious love tantamount lewdness. these
 arguments mere apologies shortcomings, screen for
 pollutions; libidinous affection lewdness, still more
 perception licentious love constitute lewdness. hence is
 indulgence sensuality gratification licentious
 affection originate entirely relish lust, well a
 hankering licentious love. you, object love,
 lewd heavens remote ages the
 present time!"
 
pao-yü quite dumbstruck heard, hastily smiling, he
 said way reply: "my fairy labours misapprehension. simply
 reluctance read books parents have, repeated
 occasions, extended injunction reprimand, the
 courage go far rashly plunge lewd habits? besides, am
 still young years, notion implied lewdness!"
 
"not so!" exclaimed fairy; "lewdness, although one thing in
 principle is, far meaning goes, subject different
 constructions; exemplified world whose heart is
 set upon lewdness. delight solely faces figures; others find
 insatiable pleasure singing dancing; dalliance and
 raillery; others incessant indulgence lusts; these
 regret beautiful maidens heavens minister
 short-lived pleasure. several kinds persons foul
 objects steeped skin lewdness. lustful love, for
 instance, sprung life taken root natural
 affections, extend character an

 transmitted mouth; can fathomed spirit, but
 divulged words. now imbued desire only

 will inevitably misconstrued defamed; every mouth will
 ridicule you; every eye will look upon contempt. after
 meeting recently worthy ancestors, two dukes ning jung,
 opened hearts made wishes known such
 fervour, (but will solely account splendour of
 inner apartments look despisingly upon path world),
 consequently led along, son, inebriated luscious
 wines, steeped spiritual tea, admonished excellent

ended remarks, initiated mysteries of
 licentious love, and, pushing pao-yü room, closed door,
 took departure alone. pao-yü dazed state complied with
 admonitions given fairy, natural result was, of
 course, violent flirtation, circumstances be
 impossible recount.
 
next day came, time attached ties

 place, nothing else met gaze thorns brambles, which
 covered ground, wolf tiger walking side side. before

 progress; stream was, more, bridge to
 enable one cross it.
 
exercising minds perplexity, suddenly
 espied fairy coming back pursuit them. "desist at
 once," exclaimed, "from making advance stream; is
 urgent should, speed, turn faces round!"
 
pao-yü lost time standing still. "what place?" he
 inquired.
 
"this ford enticement," explained fairy. "its depth ten
 thousand chang; breadth thousand li; stream no
 boats paddles means effect passage. simply
 raft, mu chu-shih directs rudder, hui shih chen
 punts poles. receive compensation shape gold
 silver, come across one whose destiny to
 cross, ferry over. now accident strolled far as

words scarcely concluded, suddenly heard the

 whereupon whole crowd gobblins sea-urchins laid hands upon

must observe mrs. ch'in just inside apartment the

 communed within herself, "as far infant name goes, is, in

"did ever mention going?" questioned pao-yü; "i wish

"it's snowy day," consequently remarked pao-yü's nurse, dame li, "and
 must also look time, better remain amuse

 told boys liberty go.
 
time mrs. hsüeh prepared tea several kinds nice
 things kept partake delicacies. pao-yü, having
 spoken highly goose feet ducks' tongues tasted some

 promptly produced several dishes kind, made herself, and
 gave pao-yü try. "with little wine," added pao-yü a
 smile, "they first rate."
 
mrs. hsüeh thereupon bade servants fetch wine best

 "never mind wine."
 
pao-yü smilingly pleaded: "my nurse, take just one cup no
 more."
 
"it's use," nurse li replied, "were grandmother mother

nurse li heard words, alternative go a

"the wine need warmed: prefer cold!" pao-yü went to

"that do," remonstrated mrs. hsüeh; "cold wine will make hand

 intestines devolves warming it, can derive harm?
 yet time change habit yours? leave off
 drinking cold wine."
 
pao-yü finding words heard contained good deal of
 sense, speedily put cold wine, asked warm
 it, length drank it.
 
tai-yü bent upon cracking melon seeds, saying nothing simply
 pursing lips smiling, when, strange coincidence, hsüeh yen,
 tai-yü's waiting-maid, walked handed mistress small

"who told bring it?" ascertained tai-yü grinningly. "i'm sorry to

"you've always delicate unable stand cold," interposed
 "aunt" hsüeh, "and kind attention part have

"you know, aunt, really stands," responded tai-yü
 smilingly; "fortunately enough, sent quarters;

 hand-stove, one fussily sent home? people
 say waiting-maids officious, will imagine

"you're far punctilious," remarked mrs. hsüeh, "as entertain such

 state) enhanced conversation laughter cousins, that
 ready agree more! constrained a
 humble spirit entreat permission. "my dear nurse," implored,
 "i'll just take two cups more."
 
"you'd better careful," added nurse li, "your father home

pao-yü heard mention, spirits sank within him, and
 gently putting wine aside, dropped head upon breast.
 
tai-yü promptly remonstrated. "you've thrown cold water," said,
 "over spirits whole company; why, uncle ask see

saying this, gave pao-yü big nudge intent of
 stirring spirits, adding, addressed low tone of

dame li also knew well tai-yü's disposition, therefore
 remarked: "now, miss lin, urge on; all,
 give good advice, may, think, listen good deal what

"why urge on?" rejoined lin tai-yü, sarcastic smile,
 "nor will trouble give advice. you, old lady, far

pao ch'ai suppress smile, pinched tai-yü's
 cheek, exclaimed, "oh tongue frowning girl! one can

 while, though two three nurses attendance, they
 concern going on. soon saw
 nurse li left, likewise quietly slipped out, the
 first opportunity found, remained two

"none nurses," hurriedly interposed aunt hsüeh, "are yet come,

"why wait them?" observed pao-yü. "we the
 waiting-maids escort us, surely enough."
 
mrs. hsüeh finding difficult set mind ease deputed two
 married women accompany two cousins; both

"do take good care him," therefore enjoined servants, and
 suddenly bethought pao-yü's attendants, "how it,"
 inquired all, "that see nurse li here?"
 
venture tell truth, gone home, but
 simply explained come moments back, they
 thought must gone business other.
 
"she's better venerable ladyship," remarked pao-yü,
 turning round swaying side side. "why ask her?
 rid her, believe might live little longer."
 
uttering words, reached door bedroom, he
 saw pen ink laid writing table.
 
"that's nice," exclaimed ch'ing wen, came meet a

pao-yü remembered taken place morning. "where are

"why man tipsy," remarked ch'ing wen sneeringly. "as were
 going mansion, told stick door. i
 afraid lest one else spoil them, being
 pasted, climbed high ladder ever long putting

"oh forgot it," replied pao-yü grinning, "if hands are

"are making fun me?" asked pao-yü smiling; "what about
 sister hsi jen?" went inquire.
 
ch'ing wen pouted lips, pointing towards stove-couch the
 inner room, and, looking in, pao-yü espied hsi jen fast asleep her
 daily costume.
 
"well," pao-yü observed laughing, "there's harm it, rather
 early sleep. early meal, side," he
 proceeded, speaking ch'ing wen, "there small dish dumplings,
 bean-curd outside; thought like some, i
 asked mrs. yu them, telling keep them, eat them

 perchance seen them?"
 
"be quick drop subject," suggested ch'ing wen; "as soon they
 brought over, knew intended me; had
 just finished meal, put there, nurse li came
 saw them. 'pao-yü,' said, 'is likely eat them, i'll

 take home."
 
speaking, hsi hsüeh brought tea, pao-yü pressed his
 cousin lin cup.
 
"miss lin gone long ago," observed them, burst out
 laughing, "and offer tea?"
 
pao-yü drank half cup, also suddenly bethought himself
 tea, brewed morning. "this morning," he
 therefore inquired hsi hsüeh, "when made cup maple-dew tea,
 told kind tea requires brewing three four times
 colour appears; now bring this
 tea?"
 
"i really put by," answered hsi hsüeh, "but nurse li came and
 drank it, went off."
 
pao-yü upon hearing this, dashed cup held hand the
 ground, broke small fragments, crash, spattered
 hsi hsüeh's petticoat over.
 
"of whose family mistress?" inquired pao-yü hsi hsüeh, as
 jumped up, "that pay deference her. just simply had
 little milk, brat, all; now has
 got way thinking high mighty even the
 heads family! packed off, shall all

saying this, bent upon going, then, tell dowager
 lady chia nurse driven away.
 
hsi jen really asleep, simply feigning, idea, when
 pao-yü came, startle play. first, heard speak
 writing, inquire dumplings, think it
 necessary get up, flung tea-cup floor, got
 temper, promptly jumped tried appease him, to
 prevent coaxing carrying threat.
 
waiting-maid sent dowager lady chia came in, meanwhile, ask what
 matter.
 
"i just gone pour tea," replied hsi jen, without least
 hesitation, "and slipped snow fell, cup dropped
 hand broke. decision send away good," she
 went advise pao-yü, "and willing go also; why
 avail opportunity dismiss us body? will

 getting better people come wait you!"
 
pao-yü heard taunt, length word say, and
 supported hsi jen attendants couch, they
 divested clothes. failed understand drift of
 pao-yü kept still muttering, make an
 endless string words; eyes grew heavier drowsier, and
 forthwith waited upon went sleep; hsi jen
 unclasped jade spiritual perception, rolling a
 handkerchief, lay mattress, idea he
 put next day chill neck.
 
pao-yü fell sound asleep moment lay head pillow. by
 time nurse li others come in, heard that
 pao-yü tipsy, venture approach, gently made
 inquiries whether asleep not. hearing was,
 took departure minds ease.
 
next morning moment pao-yü awoke, one came tell him
 young mr. jung, living mansion side, had
 brought ch'in chung pay visit.
 
pao-yü speedily went greet take pay
 respects dowager lady chia. venerable ladyship upon

ch'in chung made suitable answer one remarks, on
 return home told everything father.
 
father, ch'in pang-yeh, held present post secretary the
 peking field force, well-nigh seventy. wife died an
 early period, left issue, adopted daughter

ch'in pang-yeh fiftieth year length got son.
 tutor previous year left go south, remained home
 keeping former lessons; (his father) just thinking
 talking matter relatives chia family, and
 sending private school, when, luck it, this
 opportunity meeting pao-yü presented itself.
 
knowing besides family school direction the
 venerable scholar chia tai-ju, hoping joining class,

 therefore intensely gratified. drawbacks his
 official emoluments scanty, eyes everyone in

 engaged reading books, set mind books;
 think home engaged reading. whatever
 do, romp together them, meet master,
 father, will joke! although asserted scholar
 must strain every nerve excel, yet preferable tasks
 somewhat fewer, as, first place, one eats too
 much, one digest it; and, second place, good health must

 times consider practice."
 
hsi jen gave utterance sentence, pao-yü nodded head in
 sign approval sentence. hsi jen went speak. "i've

saying this, completed toilette, hsi jen pressed

pao-yü, gone give orders ch'ing wen she
 yueh, length left apartments, coming over, paid obeisance
 dowager lady chia. venerable ladyship likewise, matter
 course, recommendations make him, ended, next
 went greeted madame wang; leaving quarters, came
 library wish chia cheng good morning.
 
happened, chia cheng day returned home early
 hour, was, moment, library, engaged friendly
 chat gentlemen, family companions. suddenly
 perceiving pao-yü come pay respects, report was

family companions stood smilingly expostulated.
 
"venerable sir," pleaded, "why need upon him? our
 worthy brother day going school, may two three
 years able display abilities establish reputation. he
 will, beyond doubt, behave like child, years gone
 past. time breakfast also drawing nigh, should,
 worthy brother, go once."
 
words spoken, two among them, advanced in
 years, readily took pao-yü hand, led library.
 
"who attendance upon pao-yü?" chia cheng inquired, he
 heard suitable reply, "we, sir!" given outside; three four
 sturdy fellows entered early period fell one knee, and
 bowed paid obeisance.
 
chia cheng came scrutinise were, recognised li
 kuei, pao-yü's nurse, addressed him. "you
 people," said, "remain waiting upon whole day long school,
 books read? books indeed! why, read and
 filled brains lot trashy words nonsensical phrases,
 learnt ingenious way waywardness. wait till little
 leisure, set work, first foremost, flay skin
 off, settle accounts good-for-nothing!"
 
threat terrified li kuei hastily fell knees,
 pulled hat, knocked head ground, gave vent to
 repeated assenting utterances: "oh, quite so, sir! elder brother mr.
 pao has," continued, "already read third book book
 odes, something like: 'yiu, yiu, the
 deer bleat; lotus leaves duckweed.' servant wouldn't
 presume tell lie!"
 
said this, whole company burst boisterous fit of
 laughter, chia cheng also contain countenance
 laugh. "were even," observed, "to read thirty books of
 book odes, much imposition upon people no
 more, (when thief) who, order steal bell, stops his
 ears! go present compliments gentleman the
 schoolroom, tell him, part, whole lot odes and
 old writings use, subjects empty show; and
 should, things, take four books, explain them
 him, first last, make know thoroughly by
 heart,--that important thing!"
 
li kuei signified obedience promptitude, perceiving
 chia cheng nothing say, retired room.
 
while, pao-yü standing alone outside the
 court, waiting quietly suppressed voice, came he
 walked away company.
 
li kuei companions observed shook clothes, "did
 you, worthy brother, hear said first flay
 skins off! people's servants acquire respectability the
 master serve, poor fellows fruitlessly wait upon you,
 beaten blown bargain. well were,
 henceforward, treated certain amount regard."
 
pao-yü smiled, "dear brother," added, "don't feel aggrieved; i'll
 invite come round to-morrow!"
 
"my young ancestor," replied li kuei, "who presumes look forward to
 invitation? entreat listen one two words have
 say, all."
 
talked came dowager lady chia's this
 side.
 
ch'in chung already arrived, old lady first a
 chat him. forthwith two exchanged salutations, took
 leave ladyship; pao-yü, suddenly remembering not
 said good-bye tai-yü, promptly betook tai-yü's
 quarters so.
 
tai-yü was, time, window, facing mirror, and
 adjusting toilette. upon hearing pao-yü mention his
 way school, smiled remarked, "that's right! now going
 school sure reach lunar palace pluck the
 olea fragrans; go along you."
 
"my dear cousin," rejoined pao-yü, "wait come school,
 evening meal; wait also come prepare the
 cosmetic rouge."
 
protracted chat, length tore away took his
 departure.
 
"how it," interposed tai-yü, called and
 stopped him, "that go bid farewell cousin pao
 ch'ai?"
 
pao-yü smiled, saying word way reply straightway
 walked school, accompanied ch'in chung.
 
public school, must noticed also far his
 quarters, originally instituted founder the
 establishment, idea among young
 fellows clan means engage tutor, they
 readily able enter class prosecution their
 studies; family held official position should
 give (the institution) pecuniary assistance, view meet the
 expenses necessary allowances students; to
 select men advanced years possessed virtue act tutors of
 family school.
 
two them, ch'in chung pao-yü, now entered class, and
 whole number schoolmates made each
 other's acquaintance, studies commenced. ever since this
 time, two wont come together, go together, get up
 together, sit together, till became intimate close.
 besides, dowager lady chia got fond ch'in chung, again
 keep stay three five days time,
 treating one great-grandsons. perceiving
 ch'in chung's home much way sufficiency,
 also helped clothes necessaries; scarcely had
 one two months elapsed ch'in chung got friendly terms with
 every one jung mansion.
 
pao-yü was, however, human practise contentment
 observe propriety; sole delight every caprice
 gratified, naturally developed craving disposition. "we two, you
 i, are," also wont secretly tell ch'in chung, "of same
 age, fellow-scholars besides, need future
 pay regard relationship uncle nephew; should
 treat brothers friends, all."
 
ch'in chung first (explained that) presumptuous;
 pao-yü listen thing, went address
 brother call style ch'ing ch'ing, had
 likewise help, begin calling him, random, anything
 anyhow.
 
were, true, large number pupils school, but
 consisted sons younger brothers clan, and
 several sons nephews family connections. proverb
 appositely describes nine species dragons, that
 species differs; goes course without saying a
 large number human beings dragons snakes, confusedly
 admixed, creatures low standing included.
 
ever since arrival two young fellows, ch'in chung pao-yü,
 appearance handsome budding flowers, and
 they, one hand, saw modest genial ch'in chung was, he
 blushed uttered word, timid demure like a
 girl, hand, pao-yü naturally proficient in
 abasing demeaning himself, affable good-natured,
 considerate temperament full conversation, that
 two were, consequence, terms intimate friendship, it
 was, fact, matter surprise whole company of
 fellow-students began foster envious thoughts, they, behind
 backs, passed account, one one disparaging remark
 one another, insinuated slanderous lies against
 them, extended inside well outside school-room.
 
indeed, hsüeh p'an come take quarters madame
 wang's suite apartments, shortly came hear existence of
 family school, school mainly attended young
 fellows tender years, inordinate ideas suddenly aroused in
 him. therefore fictitiously gave went school,
 [he irregular attendance fisherman] catches
 fish three days, suns nets next two; simply
 presenting school-fee gift chia tai-jui making least
 progress studies; sole dream knit number of
 familiar friendships. thought it, this
 school young pupils, who, greed obtain money, clothes and
 eatables hsüeh p'an, allowed cajoled him, and
 played tricks upon; topic, likewise superfluous to
 dilate length.
 
also two lovable young scholars, relatives branch of
 family known, whose real surnames names also not
 ascertained, who, reason good winsome looks, were,
 pupils whole class, given two nicknames, one of
 "hsiang lin," "fragrant love," "yü ai," "precious
 affection." although every one entertained feelings secret
 admiration them, wish take liberties young
 fellows, lived, nevertheless, one all, terror hsüeh
 p'an's imperious influence, courage come
 forward interfere them.
 
soon ch'in chung pao-yü had, time, come school, and
 made acquaintance two fellow-pupils, too
 help becoming attached admiring them, they
 also came know great friends hsüeh p'an, did
 not, consequence, venture treat lightly, unseemly in
 behaviour towards them. hsiang lin yü ai kept to
 feelings, fostered ch'in chung and
 pao-yü, reason assigned fact though these
 four persons nurtured fond thoughts hearts however no
 visible sign them. day day, one would, during
 school hours, sit four distinct places: eight eyes were
 secretly linked together; and, indulging either innuendoes or
 double entendres, hearts, spite distance between
 them, reflected whole number thoughts.
 
though outward attempts devoted evade detection of
 people's eyes, happened that, least expected,
 several sly lads discovered real state affairs, result
 whole school stealthily frowned eyebrows them, winked
 eyes them, coughed them, raised voices them;
 proceedings were, fact, restricted one single day.
 
luck it, day tai-jui was, account business,
 compelled go home; left task a
 heptameter line antithetical couplet, explaining should
 find sentence rhyme, following day came back,
 set lessons, went hand affairs
 connected class elder grandson, chia jui, asked
 take charge.
 
wonderful say hsüeh p'an late frequented school very
 often, even much answer roll, ch'in chung
 availed absence ogle smirk hsiang lin; and
 two pretending go out, came back court
 chat.
 
"does worthy father home mind friends?" ch'in
 chung first ask. sentence scarcely ended, when
 heard sound coughing coming behind. taken much
 aback, and, speedily turning heads round see, found that
 fellow-scholar theirs, called chin jung.
 
hsiang lin naturally somewhat hasty temperament, with
 shame anger mutually impelling other, inquired him,
 "what's cough at? likely us speak to
 other?"
 
"i mind speaking," chin jung observed laughing; "but would
 perchance cough? tell what, however; you
 anything say, utter intelligible language? were
 allowed go mysterious manner, strange doings
 to? sure enough found out, the
 need still prevaricating? will, first all, let me
 partake share little game, can hold tongue
 utter word. not, whole school will begin turn
 matter over."
 
words, ch'in chung hsiang lin exasperated that
 blood rushed faces. "what found out?" they
 hastily asked.
 
"what now detected," replied chin jung smiling, "is plain
 truth!" saying went clap hands call out
 loud voice laughed: "they moulded nice well-baked
 cakes, fellows come buy one eat!" (these two been
 larks, come fun!)
 
ch'in chung hsiang lin felt resentful well fuming with
 rage, hurried step went in, search chia jui, whom
 reported chin jung, explaining chin jung insulted them
 both, without rhyme reason.
 
fact chia jui was, extraordinary degree, man
 eye main chance, devoid sense propriety.
 wont school take advantage public matters serve his
 private interest, bring pressure upon pupils intent
 regale him. subsequently also lent his
 countenance hsüeh p'an, scheming get money eatables of
 him, left entirely free indulge disorderly behaviour; and
 go way hold check, but, the
 contrary, encouraged him, infamous though already, become a
 bully, curry favour him.
 
hsüeh p'an was, nature, gifted fickle disposition;
 to-day, incline east, to-morrow west, that
 recently obtained new friends, put hsiang lin yü ai aside.
 chin jung one time intimate friend his, ever since
 acquired friendship two lads, hsiang lin yü ai, he
 forthwith deposed chin jung. late, already come look down
 upon even hsiang lin yü ai, result chia jui well
 deprived lend support, stand him; but
 bore hsüeh p'an grudge, wearying old friends, soon as
 found new ones, felt angry hsiang lin yü ai put
 word behalf hsüeh p'an. chia jui, chin jung fact
 whole crowd were, reason, just harbouring jealous
 grudge two, saw ch'in chung hsiang lin
 come occasion lodge complaint chin jung, chia jui
 readily felt displeasure creep heart; and, although not
 venture call ch'in chung account, nevertheless made example
 hsiang lin. instead (of taking part), called a
 busybody denounced much abusive language, result
 hsiang lin not, contrariwise, profit way, brought
 displeasure upon himself. even ch'in chung grumbled the
 treatment, resumed places.
 
chin jung became still haughty, wagging head smacking
 lips, gave vent many abusive epithets; happened
 also reached yü ai's ears, two them, though seated
 apart, began altercation loud tone voice.
 
chin jung, obstinate pertinacity, clung version. "just a
 short back," said, "i actually came upon them, were
 indulging demonstrations intimate friendship back court.
 two resolved one close friendship, eloquent
 protestations, mindful persistently talking their
 trash, aware presence another person."
 
language had, contrary expectations, given, very
 first, umbrage another person, you, (gentle reader,)
 imagine person been?
 
person was, fact, one whose name chia se; grandson
 likewise main branch ning mansion. parents died at
 early period, had, ever since youth, lived chia chen.
 time grown sixteen years age, was, as
 compared chia jung, still handsome good looking. two
 cousins united ties closest intimacy, always
 together, whether went stayed home.
 
inmates ning mansion many number, opinions
 mixed kind; whole bevy servants, devoid of
 sense right, solely excelled practice inventing stories
 backbite masters; mean person other
 again, known, insinuated slanderous opprobrious
 reports (against chia se). chia chen had, presumably, also come hear
 unfavourable criticisms (on account), having, course, to
 save odium suspicion, had, juncture, after
 all, apportion separate quarters, bid chia move outside
 ning mansion, went established home to
 live in.
 
chia handsome far external appearances went, and
 intelligent withal inward natural gifts, but, though nominally
 came school, simply however mere blind; treated,
 ever done, legitimate occupations, things cock
 fighting, dog-racing visiting places easy virtue. as, above,
 chia chen spoil over-indulgence; below, was
 chia jung stand him, clan consequently presume to
 run counter him?
 
seeing closest terms friendship chia jung,
 reconcile harsh treatment now saw
 ch'in chung receive persons? now bent upon pushing
 forward revenge injustice, was, time, giving
 communing heart. "chin jung, chia jui the
 rest are," pondered, "friends uncle hsüeh, on
 friendly terms him, me, come forward and
 tell old hsüeh, impair harmony exists between
 us? concern myself, idle tales make, spoken,
 every one feel uncomfortable; now devise means
 hold check, stop mouths, prevent loss
 face!"
 
concluded train thought, also pretended to
 go out, and, walking far back, he, low voice, called to
 side ming yen, page attending upon pao-yü studies, in
 one way another, made use several remarks egg on.
 
ming yen smartest pao-yü's attendants, also
 young years lacked experience, lent patient ear to
 chia say way chin jung insulted ch'in
 chung. "even master, pao-yü," (chia added), "is involved,
 let know bit mind, will next time be
 still arrogant."
 
ming yen always ready, even valid excuse, be
 insolent overbearing people, hearing news and
 furthermore instigated chia se, speedily rushed the
 schoolroom cried "chin jung;" address mr.
 chin, merely shouted "what kind fellow called chin?"
 
chia presently shuffled feet, designedly adjusted his
 dress looked rays sun. "it's time," observed and
 walking forthwith, first chia jui, explained had
 something attend like get away little early; as
 chia jui venture stop him, alternative let
 way go.
 
while, ming yen entered room promptly seizing
 chin jung grip: "what do, whether proper improper," said,
 "doesn't concern you! enough anyway defile your
 father! fine brat indeed, come meddle mr.
 ming!"
 
words plunged scholars whole class such
 consternation wistfully absently looked him.
 
"ming yen," hastily shouted chia jui, "you're kick a
 rumpus."
 
chin jung full anger face quite yellow. "what a
 subversion propriety! slave menial venture behave in
 manner! just simply speak master," exclaimed he
 readily pushed hands go lay hold pao-yü
 beat him.
 
ch'in chung point turning round leave room, when
 sound 'whiff' reached behind, caught
 sight square inkslab come flying way. thrown he
 say, struck desk chia lan chia chün were
 seated.
 
two, chia lan chia chün, also great-grandsons a
 close branch jung mansion. chia chün left
 fatherless early age, mother doated upon unusual
 manner, school friendly terms with
 chia lan, two sat together desk. have
 believed chia chün would, spite young years, have
 extremely strong mind, mostly mischief
 without least fear one. watched listless eye his
 seat chin jung's friends stealthily assist chin jung, flung an
 inkslab strike ming yen, when, luck it, hit the
 wrong mark, fell just front him, smashing atoms the
 porcelain inkslab water bottle, smudging whole book with
 ink, chia chün was, course, much incensed, hastily gave way to
 abuse. "you consummate pugnacious criminal rowdies! why, this
 amount taking share fight!" uttered
 abuse, forthwith seized inkslab, bent upon
 flinging.
 
chia lan one always tried avoid trouble, lost no
 time pressing inkslab, words mouth
 express, tried pacify him, adding "my dear brother, no
 business mine."
 
chia chün repress resentment; perceiving the
 inkslab held down, laid hold box containing books,
 flung direction; being, all, short of
 stature, weak strength, unable send anywhere near
 mark; dropped instead got far desk
 belonging pao-yü ch'in chung, dreadful crash became
 audible fell smash table. books, papers, pencils,
 inkslabs, writing materials scattered whole
 table; pao-yü's cup besides containing tea broken to
 pieces tea spilt.
 
chia chün forthwith jumped forward intent assailing the
 person flung inkslab moment chin jung took
 hold long bamboo pole near by; space was

"letting off," rejoined chia se, "is difficult thing; how

"how put happened black white paper?" observed
 chia jui.
 
"there's difficulty either!" replied chia se; "just write

"this is, fact, easy enough!" chia jui added way answer;
 chia turned round left room; returning paper and

chia jui suppress exclamation. "ai ya!" cried, he
 hastily stopped mouth hands, venture give
 vent another sound. whole head face mass filth, and
 body felt icy cold. shivered shook, espied chia se

"what's matter?" inquired servants, saw this
 sorry plight; (an inquiry) placed necessity making
 false excuse. "the night dark," explained, "and foot
 slipped fell gutter."
 
saying this, betook speedily apartment; was
 changed clothes performed ablutions, that
 began realise lady feng made fool him. he
 consequently gave way fit wrath; upon recalling mind the
 charms lady feng's face, felt extremely aggrieved he
 clasp embrace, indulged in
 wild thoughts fanciful ideas, whole night
 long close eyes.
 
time forward mind was, true, still lady feng,
 courage put foot jung mansion;
 chia jung chia coming time dun for
 money, likewise full fears lest grandfather should
 come know everything.
 
passion lady feng was, fact, already burden hard bear,
 when, moreover, troubles debts superadded tasks,
 also whole day arduous, he, young man about
 twenty, yet unmarried, prey constant cravings lady feng,
 difficult gratify, avoid giving way, great
 extent, evil habits exhausted energies. lot had, what
 more, two occasions frozen, angered endure much

 bear up. sudden, fall down, eyes,
 albeit closed, spirit still plunged confused dreams,
 mouth full nonsense subject to
 strange starts.
 
every kind doctor asked come in, every treatment had
 recourse to; and, though medicines cinnamon, aconitum seeds,
 turtle shell, ophiopogon, yü-chü herb, like, took several
 tens catties, nevertheless experienced change better;
 time twelfth moon drew end, and
 spring returned, illness become still serious.
 
tai-ju much concerned, invited doctors parts to
 attend him, none good. later on,
 take nothing else decoctions pure ginseng, tai-ju could
 course afford it. help come the
 jung mansion, make requisition some, madame wang asked lady feng
 weigh two taels give him. "the day," rejoined
 lady feng, "not long ago, concocted medicine our

lady feng acquiesced; without directing single person institute
 search, simply took refuse twigs, making mace,
 despatched meagre message sent by
 madame wang, was, fact, more; subsequently
 reporting madame wang asked obtained there

 voluptuousness, cast eyes obverse side; upon
 perceiving nought else skeleton standing it, chia jui
 sustained fright lost time covering his

 "why frighten so? go look the

 still, hitherto, stood skeleton back part.
 
chia jui had, true, experienced pleasant sensations a

 turned front round, gazed lady feng, still
 waved hand beckoned go. entering mirror,
 went way three four times, occasion,
 just issue mirror, espied two
 persons come him, made fast chains round neck,

 "what kind magical mirror it?" asked. "if destroy
 glass, will harm men world!"
 
forthwith given directions bring fire burn it, voice was
 heard air say, "who told look face it? you

chapter xiii.
 
ch'in k'o-ch'ing dies, chia jung invested rank of

 wang hsi-feng lends help management jung kuo
 mansion.
 

lady feng, must added, prosecuting narrative, ever
 since chia lien's departure accompany tai-yü yang chou, really
 dejected heart; every day, evening came, would,
 simply indulging chat laugh p'ing erh, turn in, in
 heedless frame mind, night.
 
course night day, sitting p'ing
 erh lamp-light clasping hand-stove; weary work
 embroidery, early hour, given orders warm the
 embroidered quilt, gone bed; bending her
 fingers, counting progress journey, be
 arriving, unexpectedly, third watch struck.
 
p'ing erh already fallen fast asleep; lady feng feeling at
 length sleepy eyes slightly dose, faintly discerned mrs.
 ch'in walk outside.
 
"my dear sister-in-law," said smiled, "sleep peace; on
 way back to-day, even accompany just one stage? but
 great friends along, part you,
 sister-in-law, therefore come take leave you. there
 is, besides, wish mine, yet accomplished; i
 impart you, likely telling one else will
 use."
 
lady feng make sense words heard. "what
 wish have?" inquired, "do tell me, will safe
 enough me."
 
"you are, dear sister-in-law, heroine among women," observed mrs.
 ch'in, "so much famous men, sashes official hats,
 excel you; aware even couple of
 lines common adages, trite saying, 'when moon full, it
 begins wane; waters high, must overflow?' of
 says 'if ascend high, heavy must your
 fall.' family now enjoyed splendour prosperity already
 well-nigh century, day comes height good fortune,
 calamity arises; proverb 'when tree falls, the
 monkeys scatter,' fulfilled, will futile reputation
 culture old standing whole generation?"
 
lady feng words felt heart heavy, overpowered by
 intense awe veneration.
 
"the fears express well founded," urgently remarked, "but
 plan adequate preserve future injury?"
 
"my dear sister-in-law," rejoined mrs. ch'in sardonic smile,
 "you're simple indeed! woe reached climax, weal
 supervenes. prosperity adversity, days yore the
 present time, now pass away, now revive, can

 well-regulated; two matters sure
 footing, suitable action adopted with

 perpetuate family welfare entity."
 
"what matters these?" inquired lady feng.
 
"though graves ancestors," explained mrs. ch'in,
 "sacrifices oblations offered four seasons, there's
 nevertheless fixed source income. second place, family
 school is, true, existence; definite

 reverses supervene, sons grandsons family may be
 able return homes, prosecute studies, go for

 ancestral worship will, like manner, continued perpetuity. but,
 present affluence splendour looked upon bound go on
 without intermission, thought day come, no
 enduring plan devised, presently, little while, there
 will, again, transpire felicitous occurrence exceptional kind,
 which, point fact, will resemble splendour oil scorched on
 violent fire, fresh flowers decorated brocades. should
 bear mind will also nothing real transient
 pageant, nothing short-lived pleasure! whatever do, don't
 forget proverb, 'there's banquet, however sumptuous, from
 guests disperse;' unless do, early date,
 take precautions later evils, regret will, apprehend, no
 avail."
 
"what felicitous occurrence will take place?" lady feng inquired with
 alacrity.
 
"the decrees heaven divulged; very
 friendly you, sister-in-law, long, will present you,
 take leave, two lines, behoves keep in
 mind," rejoined mrs. ch'in, consequently proceeded recite what
 follows:
 
three springs, over, radiance will wane;
 inmates seek home will fain.
 
lady feng bent upon making inquiries, heard a
 messenger second gate strike "cloudy board" four consecutive
 blows. indeed announcement death; woke lady
 feng start. servant reported lady jung eastern
 mansion more.
 
lady feng taken aback cold perspiration broke over
 person, fell vacant abstraction. she

 madame wang's apartments.
 
time, members family aware tidings,
 one feel disconsolate; one all
 much wounded heart. elder generation bethought
 dutiful submission along displayed;
 age reflected upon friendship and
 intimacy ever existed her; younger her
 remembered past benevolence. even servants household,
 whether old young, looked back upon qualities sympathy with
 poor, pity destitute, affection old, and
 consideration young; one did
 mourn loss, give way intense grief.
 
irrelevant details need dilated upon; suffice to
 confine pao-yü.
 
consequent upon lin tai-yü's return home, left self
 felt lonely. neither go disport with
 others; daily return dusk, wont retire quietly
 sleep.
 
day, yet influence dream, heard
 announcement mrs. ch'in's death, turning round
 quickly crept bed, felt heart been
 stabbed sword. sudden retch, straightway expectorated a
 mouthful blood, frightened hsi jen rest they
 rushed forward supported him.
 
"what matter?" inquired, meant also go let
 dowager lady chia know, send doctor, pao-yü dissuaded
 them.
 
"there's need flurry; nothing all," said, "it's
 simply fire grief attacked heart, blood
 circulate arteries."
 
spoke, speedily raised up, and, asking his
 clothes changing, came see dowager lady chia. wish
 go side; hsi jen, though feeling uneasy
 heart, seeing state mind in, hinder him,
 felt constrained let please himself.
 
old lady chia saw bent upon going: "the breath just
 gone body," consequently remonstrated, "and side is
 still sullied. second place now dark, wind high;
 better wait to-morrow morning, will in
 ample time."
 
pao-yü agree this, dowager lady chia gave orders get
 carriage ready, depute attendants followers to
 go him. escort went forward straightway arrived
 front ning mansion, saw main entrance wide
 open, lamps two sides giving light bright day,
 people coming going confused large numbers; the
 sound weeping inside sufficient shake mountains to
 move hills.
 
pao-yü dismounted carriage; hurried step, walked into
 apartment, coffin laid. gave vent bitter tears
 minutes, subsequently paid salutations mrs. yu.
 mrs. yu, happened, just relapse old complaint of
 pains stomach lying bed.
 
eventually came chamber salute chia chen, just
 moment chia tai-ju, chia tai-hsiu, chia ch'ih, chiao
 hsiao, chia tun, chia she, chia cheng, chia tsung, chia pin, chia hsing,
 chia kuang, chia shen, chia ch'iung, chia lin, chia se, chia ch'ang,
 chia ling, chia yün, chia ch'in, chia chen, chia p'ing, chia tsao, chia
 heng, chia fen, chia fang, chia lan, chia chun, chia chih other
 relatives families likewise arrived body.
 
chia chen wept bitterly like man tears. "of the
 whole family, whether young old, distant relatives close friends,"
 just explaining chia tai-ju rest, "who know
 girl hundred times better even son? now
 spirit retired, evident elder branch the
 family will cut will survivor."
 
gave vent words, burst tears, the
 whole company relatives set work pacify him. "she has
 already departed life," argued, "and tears also no
 avail, besides pressing thing now consult kind of
 arrangements made."
 
chia chen clapped hands. "what arrangements made!" he
 exclaimed; "nothing done, within means."
 
conversed, perceived ch'in yeh ch'in chung, well as
 several relations mrs. yu, arrive, together mrs. yu's sisters;
 chia chen forthwith bade chia ch'ung, chia shen, chia lin chia
 se, four them, go entertain guests; he, the
 time, issued directions go ask astrologer the
 imperial observatory come choose days ceremonies.
 
(this astrologer) decided coffin remain house for
 seven times seven days, forty-nine days; third
 day, mourning rites begun formal cards be
 distributed; done forty-nine days

 virtuous taoist priests should, nineteen days, offer prayers for
 absolution punishment, purification retribution. that
 services, tablet moved garden of
 concentrated fragrance, presence tablet, fifteen
 additional eminent bonzes fifteen renowned taoist priests should
 confront altar perform meritorious deeds every seven days.
 
news death wife eldest grandson reached chia
 ching; felt sure that, distant date, would
 ascend regions above, loth return home,
 expose contamination world, to
 completely waste meritorious excellence acquired past days. for
 reason, paid heed event, allowed chia chen free
 hand accomplish necessary preparations.
 
chia chen, revert, fond display and
 extravagance, found, inspection coffins, made
 pine-wood unsuitable taste; when, strange coincidence, hsüeh
 p'an came pay visit condolence, perceiving chia chen
 quest good coffin: "in establishment," readily
 suggested, "we lot timber kind called ch'iang
 wood, comes t'ieh wang mount, huang hai; which
 made coffins will rot, ten thousand years. lot
 was, fact, brought down, years back, late father; had
 one time required highness chung, prince royal
 blood; became guilty mismanagement, was, in
 consequence, used, still lying stored our
 establishment; another thing besides one the
 means purchase it. want it, come a
 look it."
 
chia chen, upon hearing this, extremely delighted, gave orders
 planks brought over. whole
 family came inspect them, found sides the
 bottom eight inches thick, grain like betel-nut, smell
 like sandal-wood musk, while, tapped hand, sound
 emitted like precious stones; one agreed in
 praising timber remarkable quality.
 
"what price?" chia chen inquired smile.
 
"even one thousand taels hand," explained hsüeh p'an laughingly,
 "i feel sure find place, buy like.
 ask price? just give workmen taels their
 labour, will quite sufficient."
 
chia chen, words, lost time giving expression profuse
 assurances gratitude, forthwith issuing directions the
 timber split, sawn made up, chia cheng proffered his
 advice. "such articles shouldn't," said, "be, idea, enjoyed by
 persons common run; quite ample body were
 placed coffin made pine best quality."
 
chia chen listen suggestion.
 
suddenly heard mrs. ch'in's waiting-maid, jui chu by
 name, had, become alive fact mistress had
 died, knocked head post, likewise succumbed the
 blows. unusual occurrence whole clan extolled high terms;
 chia chen promptly directed that, regard ceremonies, she
 treated granddaughter, body should, it
 placed coffin, also deposited hall attained
 immortality, garden concentrated fragrance.
 
likewise young waiting-maid, called pao chu, who, mrs.
 ch'in left issue, willing become adopted child, begged
 allowed undertake charge dashing mourning bowl, and
 accompanying coffin; pleased chia chen much he
 speedily transmitted orders time forth pao chu be

pao chu, rites unmarried daughter, mourned the
 coffin unwonted degree, bent upon snapping own
 life; members entire clan, well inmates of
 mansions, all, readily observed, conduct, the
 established mourning usages, without course transgression or
 confusion.
 
"chia jung," pondered chia chen, "has higher status of
 graduate purchase, designation written funeral
 streamer, will imposing, and, point fact, retinue
 will likewise small." therefore exceedingly unhappy, his
 mind, when, luck it, day, fourth
 day first seven, tai ch'üan, eunuch palace high

 sacrificial presents, sent round messengers, next came
 official chair, preceded criers beating gong, to

chia chen promptly received him, pressed seat; when
 adjourned hall loitering bees, tea presented.
 
chia chen already arrived fixed purpose, seized an
 opportunity tell wish purchase office chia

tai ch'üan understood purport remark. "it is, presume," he
 added smilingly, "that funeral rites little more
 sumptuous."
 
"my worthy sir," eagerly rejoined chia chen, "your surmise score
 perfectly correct."
 
"the question," explained tai ch'üan, "comes opportune moment;
 just present good vacancy. three hundred
 officers present constitute imperial body guard, are
 two wanting. yesterday marquis hsiang yang's third brother came to

 still remains another vacancy, which, thought it,
 fat general feng, yung hsing, asked purchase son; i
 time give answer. besides, child wants to

tai ch'üan, perusal, turned hand behind passed (the

 enjoined him, "and give excellency mr. chao, head of

 to-morrow come money weighed sent over."
 
young attendant signified obedience, tai ch'üan thereupon
 took leave. chia chen detain him, no
 success; alternative escort far the
 entrance mansion. mount chair, chia
 chen inquired, "as regards money, shall go pay the
 board, send board eunuchs?"
 
"if go pay board," observed tai ch'üan; "you
 sure suffer loss; better just weighed
 exactly one thousand taels sent place; an
 end will put trouble."
 
chia chen incessant expression gratitude. "when period
 mourning expired," consequently added, "i shall lead in

parted company, close upon this, heard the
 voices runners. was, fact, spouse shih ting, marquis

chia chen had, true, wishes gratified; but, wife
 laid inner chambers, relapse old complaint,

 much distressed lest, high officials (and their
 wives) came went, occur breach prescribed
 conventionalities, afraid evoke ridicule. hence it

 elder brother, still full concern?"
 
chia chen forthwith explained ladies'
 apartments one (to honours), pao-yü these
 words smiled: "what difficulty it?" remarked; "i'll
 recommend one take temporary charge direction things

"who it?" chia chen quick ask; pao-yü perceived that
 still many relatives friends seated around, did
 feel well speak out; went chia

 women whole household, entertaining guests, when
 heard servant announce mr. chia chen come. (this
 announcement) took whole body ladies young ladies much by

 shuffling along, propping staff.
 
"you well?" therefore remarked madame hsing others, "and
 besides much attend consecutive days,
 require rest get right; again

chia chen was, leant staff, straining every nerve bend

 express sense obligation trouble taken, when
 madame hsing ladies hastily called pao-yü raise up,
 bidding servant move chair sit on. chia chen not
 take seat; making effort return smile, "your nephew," he
 urged, "has come over, favour want ask two
 aunts well eldest cousin."
 
"what it?" promptly inquired madame hsing rest.
 
"my aunts," chia chen replied haste, "you surely aware that

madame hsing smiled. "is really come?" she
 asked; "your eldest cousin present staying aunt secunda,
 speak will right."
 
"how ever mere child like her," speedily remonstrated madame
 wang, "carry matters? manage things
 properly, will, contrary, make people laugh, would
 therefore better trouble one else."
 
"what ideas are, aunt," rejoined chia chen smiling, "your nephew
 guessed; afraid lest eldest cousin bear
 fatigue annoyance; say, manage

 now heard chia chen make appeal disconsolate mood, she
 relented considerably resolution. turned eyes
 towards lady feng (to ascertain wishes), saw was

lady feng along found greatest zest taking initiative

 seeing besides madame wang show signs relenting, readily turned

"this affair is, true, great moment," lady feng replied
 smiling, hearing appeal; "but thing madame
 wang longer attend matters nature."
 
"if madame heed them," suggested old nun, "you, lady, can
 safely assume direction."
 
"i'm neither need money spend," added lady feng a

"what say may true enough," remarked; "but chang family

old nun upon hearing remark exceedingly delighted, that
 precipitately exclaimed, "they've got it, got it! will

"i'm not," lady feng went add, "like people, afford help

"just see," remarked lady feng, "how hard pressed am; place can

"a small trifle like this," hinted old nun, "would, placed the

string flattery pleased lady feng more, that
 heedless fatigue went chat still greater zest.
 
but, thing unthought of, ch'in chung availed darkness, as
 well absence one about, come quest chih neng.
 soon reached room back, espied chih neng all
 alone inside washing tea cups; ch'in chung forthwith seized her
 arms implanted kisses cheek. chih neng got a
 dreadful state, stamping feet, cried, "what to?" and
 just point shouting out, ch'in chung rejoined:
 "my dear girl! nearly dead impatience, again

"what bent upon," added chih neng, "can't effected; unless

"this course easy enough!" remonstrated ch'in chung; "but the
 distant water extinguish close fire!"
 
spoke, one puff, put light, plunging whole
 room pitch darkness; seizing chih neng, pushed the
 stove-couch started violent love affair. chih neng not,
 though strained every nerve, escape importunities; she
 well shout, felt compelled humour him; he
 midst ecstatic joy, perceived person walk in,
 pressed down, without uttering even much sound,
 plunged fright souls flew away
 spirits wandered bodies; third
 party burst laughing spurting sound eventually
 became aware pao-yü; when, springing feet
 impetuously, ch'in chung exclaimed full resentment, "what's that

"if get monkey up," retorted pao-yü, "why, let i
 start bawling out;" abashed chih neng availed herself

"my dear fellow," pleaded ch'in chung smilingly, "whatever don't
 shout let every one know; want, agree to."
 
"we needn't argue just now," pao-yü observed grin; "wait while,
 gone sleep, can minutely settle accounts

soon time ease clothes, go bed; lady feng
 occupied inner room; ch'in chung pao-yü outer; the
 whole ground covered matrons household, spread

nothing worth noticing occurred whole night; next day, as
 soon morning dawned, dowager lady chia madame wang promptly
 despatched servants come see pao-yü getting on; to
 tell likewise put two pieces extra clothing, if
 nothing done better go back.
 
likely pao-yü willing go back? besides ch'in
 chung, inordinate passion chih neng, instigated pao-yü to
 entreat lady feng remain another day. lady feng pondered own
 mind that, although important matters connected the
 funeral ceremonies settled satisfactorily, still a

lady feng crossed temple iron fence and
 ascertained things progressing. pao chu obstinate in

lady feng, however, while, quietly enjoyed three
 thousand taels, madame wang even much the
 faintest idea whole matter. ever since occasion, lady
 feng's audacity acquired strength; actions this
 kind, she, days, performed, defy enumeration.

words evoked smile lady feng. "mrs. hsueh, thought to
 myself," observed, "knows well mr. secundus come,
 yet, regardless propriety, she, instead (of keeping home),
 sends one inner rooms! all, you
 vixen, playing pranks!"
 
uttered remark, chia lien walked in, lady feng issued
 orders serve wine eatables, husband wife took
 seats opposite other; notwithstanding lady feng
 partial drink, nevertheless courage to
 indulge weakness, merely partook keep company.
 chia lien's nurse, dame chao, entered room, chia lien lady
 feng promptly pressed glass wine, bade sit on

"dame chao," lady feng remarked, "couldn't well bite that,

"i'll drink it," replied dame chao, "but you, lady, must also a

lady feng laughed. "you'd better," suggested, "put two elder

 body relative), but, contrary, outsider and

 also incorrect, eh? regard strangers you,
 contrariwise, will treat just relatives!"
 
words every one present room burst laughing; even
 nurse chao repress herself; invoked buddha,--"in

 person! regards relatives strangers, foolish distinctions
 drawn master; simply full pity

"that's quite it!" rejoined lady feng smiling sarcastically, "to those

"what say, lady, considerate," remarked nurse chao, "and

chia lien juncture feel quite ease, could
 feign smile. "you people," said, "should leave off
 talking nonsense, bring eatables let us our

 consult business."
 
"to sure have," ventured lady feng, "and neglect
 legitimate affairs; mr. chia chen tell he

"it visit (of yuan ch'un) parents," chia lien
 explained.
 
"has permission visit granted?" lady feng
 inquired alacrity.
 
"though quite granted," chia lien replied joyously, "it's
 nevertheless less accomplished fact."
 
"this indeed evidence great bounty present emperor!"
 lady feng observed smirkingly; "one hear books, see in
 plays, written time time, mention instance, even
 far back days old!"
 
dame chao took thread conversation. "indeed it's
 so!" interposed; "but truth quite stupid old age,
 heard every one, high low, clamouring few
 days, something 'hsing ch'in' 'hsing ch'in,' i
 really pay heed it; now again, something more
 'hsing ch'in,' about, wonder?"
 
"the emperor present throne," explained chia lien, "takes into
 consideration feelings people. whole world, is
 (in opinion), essential thing filial piety; maintaining
 feelings father, mother, daughter are
 indiscriminately subject one principle, without distinction
 honorable mean. present emperor day night
 waits upon majesties father empress dowager, yet
 cannot, least degree, carry full ideal filial
 piety. secondary consorts, meritorious persons inmates of

"o-mi-to-fu!" exclaimed dame chao. "is really so? you
 say, family will also making preparations reception of
 eldest young lady!"
 
"that goes without saying," added chia lien, "otherwise, what
 purpose stir just now?"
 
"it's course so!" interposed lady feng smiling, "and shall now have
 opportunity seeing something great world. misfortune is

"ai ya, ya!" ejaculated dame chao, "such thing rarely met a

"who aware facts?" ventured dame chao; "there to
 day saying that, 'in eastern sea, white jade bed

 remains even now vogue. chen family chiang nan recently

"i've often heard," continued lady feng, "my eldest uncle say that
 things state, believe? what
 surprises ever happened family attained such
 opulence honour!"
 
"i'll tell ladyship one sentence," replied nurse chao.
 "why simply took emperor's money spent emperor's
 person, all! family lot money to
 indulge useless extravagance?"
 
engaged conversation, servant came second

 finished meal not; lady feng forthwith concluding there
 must something waiting attend to, hurriedly rushed through
 repast. just rinsed mouth start when
 youths, duty second gate, also reported two

"thank uncle warmly," chia lien rejoined smilingly, "for trouble he
 taken thinking me; shall, case, comply his
 wishes go over. plan certainly proper one, while
 trouble will thus saved, erection quarters will likewise
 easy matter; distinct plot selected be
 purchased, involve far greater difficulties. more,
 things wouldn't, all, properly be. you

 gentlemen wish introduce change in
 proposals, will rest entirely uncle prevent them, as
 account advisable go cast one's choice other

chia jung hastily signified assent several yes's, chia se
 also came forward deliver message. "the mission ku su," he
 explained, "to find tutors, purchase servant girls, obtain

 confided me; take along two sons a

upon hearing this, chia lien scrutinised chia se. "what!" asked, "are
 able undertake commissions? matters are, true,
 great moment; something hidden them!"
 
chia smiled. "the best thing can do," remarked, "will to
 execute novice sort way, all."
 
chia jung standing next lady feng, light lamp,
 stealthily pulled lapel dress. lady feng understood the
 hint, putting smiling expression, "you full fears!"
 interposed. "is likely uncle chen doesn't, all,

"of course is!" observed chia lien; "but entertain
 wish factious; object devise plan other

"a little ago deliberations reached point," rejoined chia
 se; "and mr. lai suggested necessity take

chia lien nodded head. "this plan first-rate!" added.
 
"since so," observed lady feng, addressed chia
 se, "i've two able reliable men; take with
 you, attend matters, convenience?"
 
chia forced smile. "i just point," rejoined, "of
 asking you, aunt, loan two men, suggestion a
 strange coincidence."
 
went ascertain names, lady feng inquired
 nurse chao. nurse chao had, time, become
 quite dazed listening conversation, p'ing erh to
 give push, smiled, returned consciousness.
 "the one," hastened reply, "is called chao t'ien-liang the

"whatever do," suggested lady feng, "don't forget them; now i'm
 look duties."
 
words, left room, chia jung promptly followed her
 out, gentle voice said her: "of whatever want, aunt,
 issue orders list drawn up, give brother to
 take him, carry commissions according the
 list."
 
"don't talk nonsense!" replied lady feng laughing; "i've found place,
 yet, put away things; stealthy
 practices people take fancy?"
 
uttered words straightway went way.
 
chia se, time, likewise, asked chia lien: "if want anything
 (in way curtains), can conveniently woven you,
 along rest, bring present you."
 
"don't high glee!" chia lien urged grin, "you've but
 recently learning business, come first and
 foremost excel tricks kind? require anything, of

finished speaking, dismissed two young men; and, quick
 succession, servants came make business reports, limited to
 three five companies, chia lien felt exhausted, forthwith
 sent word duty second gate allow one at

 till next day, give mind done.
 
lady feng come retire rest till third watch; but
 nothing need said whole night.
 
next morning, early hour, chia lien got called chia
 chia cheng; which, came ning kuo mansion;
 when, company old major-domos servants, well as
 several old family friends companions, inspected grounds
 two mansions, drew plans palatial buildings (for the
 accommodation imperial consort escort) visit to

day masons workmen every trade collected to
 full number; articles gold, silver, copper, pewter,
 well earth, timber, tiles, bricks, brought over, and
 carried in, incessant supplies. first place, orders were

 roll names workmen, superintend works and
 duties relative thereto, recorded one pen

 subject shall refer time, allude pao-yü.
 
late household concerns magnitude to
 attend to, chia cheng come examine lessons, so
 was, course, high spirits, but, unfortunately ch'in
 chung's complaint became, day day, serious, same
 time really distressed heart account, enjoyment
 question.
 
day, got soon dawn, just combed
 hair washed face hands, bent upon going ask
 dowager lady chia allow pay visit ch'in chung, he
 suddenly espied ming yen peep round curtain-wall second gate,
 withdraw head. pao-yü promptly walked inquired what
 to.
 
"mr. ch'in chung," observed ming yen, "is well all."
 
pao-yü words quite taken aback. "it yesterday," he
 hastily added, "that saw him, still bright cheery; and
 anything well now?"
 
"i explain," replied ming yen; "but just minutes ago
 old man belonging family came express purpose of
 giving tidings."
 
upon hearing news, pao-yü turned round told
 dowager lady chia; old lady issued directions depute some
 trustworthy persons accompany him. "let go," (she said), "and
 satisfy feelings towards fellow-scholar; soon has
 done, must come back; let tarry long."
 
pao-yü hurried step left room came changed clothes.
 arrival outside, carriage yet got
 ready, fell state excitement, went round and
 round hall quite erratic manner. short while,
 pressure brought bear, carriage arrived, and
 speedily mounting vehicle, drove door ch'in chung's
 house, followed li kuei, ming yen servants. everything
 quiet. soul about. like hive bees flocked into
 house, astonishment two distant aunts, several male
 cousins ch'in chung, time effect retreat.
 
ch'in chung had, time, two three fainting fits, had
 already long ago changed mat. soon pao-yü realised the
 situation, felt unable repress bursting forth aloud.
 li kuei promptly reasoned him. "you go way,"
 urged, "you shouldn't. mr. ch'in weak lying
 flat stove-couch naturally made bones feel uncomfortable; and
 temporarily removed ease a
 little. you, sir, go way, will not, instead of
 good, aggravate illness?"
 
words, pao-yü accordingly restrained himself, held his
 tongue; drawing near, gazed ch'in chung's face, as
 white wax, closed eyes, gasped breath, rolling
 pillow.
 
"brother ching," speedily exclaimed pao-yü, "pao-yü here!" though
 shouted two three consecutive times, ch'in chung heed
 him.
 
"pao-yü come!" pao-yü went cry. ch'in chung's spirit
 already departed body, leaving behind faint breath
 superfluous air lungs.
 
just caught sight number recording devils, holding a
 warrant carrying chains, coming seize him, ch'in chung's soul
 account go along them; remembering there
 home one assume direction domestic affairs, and
 feeling concerned chih neng yet home, consequently
 used hundreds arguments entreaties recording devils;
 alas! devils would, none them, show favour. the
 contrary, heaped invectives upon ch'in chung.
 
"you're fortunate enough man letters," insinuated, "and
 know common saying that: 'if prince hell call upon
 die third watch, can presume retain you, human
 being, fifth watch?' abode, unseen, high well
 low, alike face made iron, heed selfish
 motives; unlike mortal world, favouritism partiality
 prevail. exist therefore many difficulties way (to our
 yielding wishes)."
 
fuss going on, ch'in chung's spirit suddenly grasped the
 four words, "pao-yü come," without loss time, went on
 make urgent appeals. "gentlemen, spiritual deputies,"
 exclaimed; "show little mercy allow return make
 just one remark intimate friend mine, back again."
 
"what intimate friend again?" devils observed one
 voice.
 
"i'm deceiving you, gentlemen," rejoined ch'in chung; "it's the
 grandson duke jung kuo, whose infant name pao-yü."
 
decider life was, first, upon hearing words, seized
 dismay vehemently abused devils sent errand.
 
"i told you," shouted, "to let go back turn; would

company devils perceived manner decider life,
 likewise seized consternation bustled
 hand feet; hearts also full resentment: "you,
 sir," replied, "were one time terror, formidable as
 lightning; forsooth able listen equanimity to
 two sounds 'pao-yü?' humble idea mortal is, and
 immortal are, credit feared him!"
 
whether ch'in chung, all, died survived, next chapter
 will explain.

ch'in chung, resume story, departed life, pao-yü went on
 unceasingly bitter lamentations, li kuei other
 servants had, ever long, arduous task trying comfort him
 desisted; return home still exceedingly
 disconsolate.
 
dowager lady chia afforded monetary assistance amount several
 tens taels; exclusive this, sacrificial presents
 likewise got ready. pao-yü went paid visit condolence the
 family, seven days funeral burial took place, but
 particulars put record.
 
pao-yü, however, continued mourn (his friend) day day, and
 incessant remembrance him, likewise help
 it. neither known many days got grief.
 
day, chia chen others came tell chia cheng the
 works garden reported completed, mr.
 chia already inspected them. "it remains," (they said),
 "for you, sir, see them; possibly anything which
 proper, steps will taken effect alterations, so
 tablets scrolls may conveniently written."
 
chia cheng listened words, pondered while.
 "these tablets scrolls," remarked, "present however difficult
 task. according rites, should, order obviate any
 shortcoming, request imperial consort deign compose them; but
 honourable consort gaze upon scenery own
 eyes, will also difficult conceive nature and
 indite upon it! wait arrival highness,
 request honour grounds visit, composes
 inscriptions, wide landscape, many pavilions and
 arbours, will, without one character way motto, albeit it
 may abound flowers, willows, rockeries, streams, nevertheless
 way able show points beauty advantage."
 
whole party family companions, stood by, smiled. "your views,
 remarkable sir," ventured, "are excellent; now a
 proposal make. tablets scrolls every locality cannot, any
 account, dispensed with, likewise, means,
 determined upon good! now, time being, two, three or
 four characters fixed upon, harmonising scenery, carry out,
 form's sake, idea, provisionally utilised as
 mottoes lanterns, tablets scrolls, hung up, pending the
 arrival highness, visit grounds, she
 requested decide upon devices, two exigencies
 met satisfactorily?"
 
"your views perfectly correct," observed chia cheng, had
 heard suggestion; "and go to-day look the
 place set work write inscriptions; which, if
 suitable, can readily used; and, unsuitable, yü-ts'un can be
 sent for, asked compose fresh ones."
 
whole company smiled. "if you, sir, compose to-day,"
 ventured, "they sure excellent; need will there
 wait yü-ts'un!"
 
"you people aware," chia cheng added smiling countenance,
 "that been, even young days, mediocre composition
 stanzas flowers, birds, rockeries streams; now that
 well years moreover fatigue trouble my
 official duties, become literary compositions like these, which
 require light heart gladsome mood, still inapt. even
 succeed composing any, will unavoidably doltish and
 forced contrariwise instrumental making the
 flowers, trees, garden pavilions, demerits, lose in
 beauty, present instead pleasing feature."
 
"this anyhow matter," remonstrated family companions,
 "for perusing can decide upon together, one
 us recommending thinks best; excellent can kept,
 faulty can discarded; nothing unfeasible about
 this!"
 
"this proposal apposite," rejoined chia cheng. "what's more, the
 weather is, rejoice, fine to-day; go company and
 look."
 
saying this, stood went forward, head whole
 party; chia chen betook advance garden let
 every one know coming. luck it, pao-yü--for he
 last days thinking ch'in chung ceaselessly
 sad wounded heart, dowager lady chia frequently directed
 servants take new garden play--made entrance
 just time, suddenly became aware arrival chia
 chen, said smile, "don't yet run away fast as
 can? mr. chia cheng will coming while."
 
words, pao-yü led nurse youths, rushed at
 garden, like streak smoke; turned a
 corner, came face face chia cheng, advancing towards
 direction, head visitors; time
 get way, course open stand one
 side.
 
chia cheng had, late, heard tutor extol saying he
 displayed special ability rhyming antithetical lines, that
 although like read books, nevertheless possessed
 depraved talents, hence induced this
 moment promptly bid follow garden, intent
 putting test.
 
pao-yü make object was, compelled to
 follow. soon reached garden gate, caught sight of
 chia chen, standing one side, along several managers: "see that
 garden gate closed time," chia cheng exclaimed, "for we'll
 first see outside go in."
 
chia chen directed servant close gate, chia cheng first
 looked straight ahead towards gate espied same
 side main entrance suite five apartments. above, the
 cylindrical tiles resembled backs mud eels. doors, railings,
 windows, frames finely carved designs new
 fashion, painted neither vermilion white colours. the
 whole extent walls polished bricks uniform colour;
 below, white marble terrace steps engraved with
 western foreign designs; came look right to
 left, everything white snow. foot white-washed
 walls, tiger-skin pebbles were, without regard pattern, promiscuously
 inserted earth way selves form
 streaks. nothing fell custom gaudiness display so
 much vogue, naturally felt full delight; and, he
 forthwith asked gate thrown open, met their
 eyes long stretch verdant hills, shut view in
 front them.
 
"what fine hill, pretty hill!" exclaimed companions
 one voice.
 
"were one hill," chia cheng explained, "whatever scenery
 contained clearly strike eye, soon one entered
 garden, pleasure been?"
 
"quite so," rejoined them. "but without large hills ravines
 one's breast (liberal capacities), one attain such
 imagination!"
 
conclusion remark, cast glance ahead them,
 perceived white rugged rocks looking, either like goblins, or
 resembling savage beasts, lying either crossways, horizontal or
 upright positions; surface grew moss lichen with
 mottled hues, parasitic plants, screened light; while,
 slightly visible, wound, among rocks, narrow pathway like the
 intestines sheep.
 
"if now go stroll along narrow path," chia cheng
 suggested, "and come return, shall have
 able see whole grounds."
 
finished speaking, asked chia chen lead way; he
 himself, leaning pao-yü, walked gorge leisurely step.
 raising head, suddenly beheld hill block stone, as
 white surface looking-glass, site was, very
 deed, suitable left inscription, bound meet
 eye.
 
"gentlemen," chia cheng observed, turned head round and
 smiled, "please look spot. name will fit give it?"
 
company heard remark, maintained two words
 "heaped verdure" written; others upheld device
 "embroidered hill." others suggested: "vying the
 hsiang lu;" others recommended "the small chung nan." various
 kinds names proposed, fall short several tens.
 
visitors been, must explained, aware early
 period fact chia cheng meant put pao-yü's ability the
 test, reason merely proposed combinations in
 common use. intention, pao-yü likewise
 cognizant.
 
listening suggestions, chia cheng forthwith turned head
 round bade pao-yü think motto.
 
"i've often heard," pao-yü replied, "that writers old opine it's
 better quote old saying compose new one; old
 engraving excels every respect engraving present day.
 more, place constitute main hill chief
 feature scenery, really site inscription
 put, constitutes first step the
 inspection landscape. well employ exact text
 old writer consisting 'a tortuous path leading secluded
 (nook).' line past days would, inscribed, be, fact,
 liberal boot."
 
listening proposed line, sang praise.
 "first-rate! excellent!" cried, "the natural talents second
 son, dear friend, lofty; mental capacity astute; unlike
 ourselves, read books simple fools."
 
"you shouldn't," urged chia cheng smilingly, "heap upon excessive
 praise; young years, merely knows one thing turns
 use ten purposes; laugh him, all; we
 can choose device."
 
spoke, entered cave, perceived beautiful trees
 thick foliage, quaint flowers lustrous bloom, line of
 limpid stream emanated deep recess among flowers trees,
 oozed crevice rock. progressing several
 steps in, gradually faced northern side, a
 stretch level ground extended far wide, side which
 soared lofty buildings, intruding skies, whose
 carved rafters engraved balustrades nestled entirely among the
 depressions hills tops trees. lowered their
 eyes looked, beheld pure stream flowing like jade, stone steps
 traversing clouds, balustrade white marble encircling pond
 embrace, stone bridge three archways, animals upon
 faces disgorging water mouths. pavilion stood on
 bridge, pavilion chia chen whole party went and
 sat.
 
"gentlemen," inquired, "what shall write this?"
 
"in record," replied, "of 'drunken old man's pavilion,'
 written days old ou yang, appears line: 'there a
 pavilion pinioned-like,' let us call 'the pinioned-like
 pavilion,' finish."
 
"pinioned-like," observed chia cheng smiling, "is indeed excellent; but
 pavilion constructed water, should, after
 all, allusion water designation. humble opinion
 line ou yang's work, '(the water) drips between
 two peaks,' make use single word 'drips.'"
 
"first-rate!" rejoined one visitors, "capital! would
 really appropriate two characters 'dripping jadelike.'"
 
chia chen pulled moustache, gave way reflection; after
 which, asked pao-yü also propose one himself.
 
"what you, sir, suggested back," replied pao-yü, "will very
 well; now sift matter thoroughly, use the
 single word 'drip' ou yang, composition niang
 spring, appear quite apposite; application, also this
 occasion, spring, character 'drip' found not
 quite suitable. moreover, seeing place intended a
 separate residence (for imperial consort), visit her
 parents, likewise imperative comply the
 principles etiquette, words kind used,
 besides coarse inappropriate; may please to
 fix upon something else recondite abstruse."
 
"what you, gentlemen, think argument?" chia cheng remarked
 sneeringly. "a little ago, whole company devised
 something original, observed better quote old
 device; now quoted old motto, maintain
 coarse inappropriate! better give us one of
 yours."
 
"if two characters like 'dripping jadelike' used," pao-yü
 explained, "it better employ two words 'penetrating
 fragrance,' unique excellent, they?"
 
chia cheng pulled moustache, nodded head utter a
 word; whereupon whole party hastily pressed forward one voice
 eulogize pao-yü's acquirements extraordinary.
 
"the selection two characters tablet easy matter,"
 suggested chia cheng, "but now go compose pair antithetical
 phrases seven words each."
 
pao-yü cast glance round four quarters, idea came his
 head, went recite:
 
willows, enclose shore, green borrow three
 bamboos;
 banks apart, flowers asunder grow, yet one perfume give.
 
upon hearing lines, chia cheng gave faint smile, nodded
 head, whilst whole party went effusive their
 praise. forthwith issued pavilions, crossed the
 pond, contemplating close attention elevation, stone,
 flower, tree. suddenly raised heads, they
 caught sight, front them, line white wall, numbers of
 columns, beautiful cottages, flourished hundreds thousands
 verdant bamboos, screened rays sun.
 
"what lovely place!" one exclaimed.
 
speedily whole company penetrated inside, perceiving, soon as
 entered gate, zigzag arcade, steps was
 raised pathway, laid promiscuously stones, furthest
 part stood diminutive cottage three rooms, two doors leading
 one without. everything interior, shape of
 beds, teapoys, chairs tables, made harmonise space
 available. leading inner room cottage small door
 which, egressed, found back-court lofty pear
 trees blossom banana trees, well two small retiring
 back-courts. foot wall, unexpectedly became visible an
 aperture spring, channel opened
 scarcely foot wide, enable run inside wall. winding
 round steps, skirted buildings reached front
 court, coiled curved, flowing bamboos.
 
"this spot," observed chia cheng full smiles, "is indeed pleasant!
 one, moonlight night, sit window study, one
 spend whole lifetime vain!"
 
said this, quickly cast glance pao-yü, terrified
 pao-yü feel hastily drooped head. whole company lost
 time choosing irrelevant talk turn conversation, and
 two visitors prosecuted remarks adding the
 tablet, spot, four characters inscribed.
 
"which four characters?" chia cheng inquired, laughingly.
 
"the bequeathed aspect river ch'i!" suggested one them.
 
"it's commonplace," observed chia cheng.
 
another person recommended "the remaining vestiges chü garden."
 
"this commonplace!" replied chia cheng.
 
"let brother pao-yü propound one!" interposed chia chen, stood
 by.
 
"before composes himself," chia cheng continued, "his wont to
 first discuss pros cons others; evident that
 impudent fellow!"
 
"he's reasonable arguments," visitors protested,
 "and called task?"
 
"don't humour much!" chia cheng expostulated. "i'll put for
 to-day," however felt constrained tell pao-yü, "with haughty
 manner, rubbishy speech, have, begin with,
 given us opinion, may next compose device. tell me, are
 will among mottoes suggested just now the
 gentlemen?"
 
"they seem unsuitable!" pao-yü hesitate say way
 reply question.
 
chia cheng gave sardonic smile. "how unsuitable?" exclaimed.
 
"this," continued pao-yü, "is first spot highness will
 honour way, inscribed, be
 appropriate, something commending sacred majesty. tablet
 four characters used, likewise devices ready at
 hand, written poets old; need compose any
 more?"
 
"are forsooth devices 'the river ch'i chu garden' those
 old authors?" insinuated chia cheng.
 
"they stiff," replied pao-yü. "would four characters: 'a
 phoenix comes dignified air,' better?"
 
clamorous unanimity whole party shouted: "excellent:" chia
 cheng nodding head; "you beast, beast!" ejaculated, "it may
 well said see thin tube more
 judgment insect! compose another stanza," consequently bade
 him; pao-yü recited:
 
precious tripod kettle, tea brewed, green still the
 smoke!
 o'er game chess still window, fingers yet
 cold.
 
chia cheng shook head. "neither seem good!" said;
 concluded remark leading company out, when
 just proceed, suddenly bethought of
 something.
 
"the several courts buildings teapoys, sideboards, tables
 chairs," added, "may said provided for. are
 still curtains, screens portieres, well the
 furniture, nicknacks curios; matched to
 suit requirements place?"
 
"of things placed about," chia chen explained, a
 good number have, early period, added, course the
 time comes everything will suitably arranged. curtains,
 screens, portieres, hung up, heard yesterday
 brother lien say yet complete, works
 first taken hand, plan place drawn, the
 measurements accurately calculated one despatched attend to
 things, thought yesterday half bound
 come in.
 
chia cheng, upon hearing explanation, readily remembered with
 concerns chia chen nothing do; speedily sent
 one go call chia lien.
 
arrived short while, "how many sorts things in
 all?" chia cheng inquired him. "of many kinds this
 time got ready? many short?"
 
question, chia lien hastily produced, flaps his
 boot, paper pocket-book, containing list, kept inside the
 tops boot. perusing reperusing it, made suitable
 reply. "of hundred twenty curtains," proceeded, "of stiff
 spotted silks, embroidered dragons relief, curtains
 large small, every kind damask silk, eighty got
 yesterday, still remain forty come. two
 portieres received yesterday; besides these, the
 two hundred red woollen portieres, two hundred portieres hsiang fei
 bamboo; two hundred door-screens rattan, gold streaks, of
 red lacquered bamboo; two hundred portieres black lacquered rattan;
 two hundred door-screens variegated thread-netting clusters of
 flowers. kinds, half come in, whole lot of
 will complete later autumn. antimacassars, table-cloths,
 flounces beds, cushions stools, thousand
 two hundred each, likewise ready hand."
 
spoke, proceeded outwards, suddenly perceived hill
 extending obliquely way intercept passage; as
 wound round curve hill faintly came view line of
 yellow mud walls, whole length covered paddy
 stalks sake protection, several hundreds of
 apricot trees bloom, presented appearance fire,
 spurted mouth, russet clouds, rising air. inside this
 enclosure, stood several thatched cottages. outside grew, other
 hand, mulberry trees, elms, mallows, silkworm oaks, whose tender
 shoots new twigs, every hue, allowed bend to
 intertwine way form two rows green fence. beyond this
 fence white mound, well, side stood
 well-sweep, windlass like articles; ground down
 divided parcels, apportioned fields, which, the
 fine vegetables cabbages flower, presented, first glance,
 aspect illimitable.
 
"this is," chia cheng observed chuckling, "the place really imbued with
 certain amount right principle; laid out, though has
 human labour, yet strikes eye, moves heart,
 help arousing wish return native place
 become farmer. let us enter rest while."
 
concluded words, point walking in, when
 unexpectedly discerned stone, outside trellis gate, the
 roadside, also left place inscribe a
 motto.
 
"were tablet," argued whole company smilingly, "put high a
 spot like this, filled by, rustic aspect farm
 case completely done away with; will better,
 yea far better erect slab ground, will make
 manifest many points beauty. unless motto composed of
 excellence fan shih-hu's song farms, will not
 adequate express charms!"
 
"gentlemen," observed chia cheng, "please suggest something."
 
"a short back," replied whole company, "your son, venerable
 brother, remarked devising new motto equal quoting an
 old one, sites kind already exhausted by
 writers days old, well should
 straightway call 'apricot blossom village?' will do
 splendidly."
 
chia cheng heard remark, smiled said, addressing
 chia chen: "this just reminds although place is
 perfect every respect, still one thing wanting shape
 wine board; better one made to-morrow the
 pattern used outside villages; needn't be
 anything gaudy, hung top tree means bamboos."
 
chia chen assented. "there's necessity," went explain, "to
 keep birds here, rear geese, ducks, fowls
 like; case will perfect keeping the
 place."
 
"a splendid idea!" chia cheng rejoined, along party.
 
"'apricot blossom village' really first-rate," continued chia cheng
 addressed company; "but thing is
 encroaches real designation village; will
 well wait (until highness comes), can request her
 give name."
 
"certainly!" answered visitors one voice; "but now far a
 name goes, mere form, let us consider expressions will be
 suitable employ."
 
pao-yü however give time think; wait chia
 cheng's permission, suggested then: "in old poetical works
 passage: 'at top red apricot tree hangs flag
 inn,' advisable, occasion, to
 temporarily adopt four words: 'the sign apricot tree is
 visible'?"
 
"'is visible' excellent," suggested whole number them, "and
 secretly accords meaning implied 'apricot
 blossom village.'"
 
"were two words 'apricot blossom' used name village,
 commonplace unsuitable;" added pao-yü a
 sardonic grin, "but another passage works poet of
 t'ang era: 'by wooden gate near water corn-flower emits
 fragrance;' make use motto 'corn fragrance
 village,' will excellent?"
 
company heard proposal, they, still greater vigour,
 unanimously combined crying "capital!" clapped their
 hands.
 
chia cheng, one shout, interrupted cries, "you ignorant child
 wrath!" ejaculated; "how many old writers can know, how
 many stanzas ancient poetical works can remember, will
 boldness show presence experienced
 gentlemen? (in allowing give vent to) nonsense you
 uttered object see whether brain clear
 muddled; fun's sake, all; lo, taken
 things real earnest!"
 
saying this, led company interior hall the
 mallows. windows pasted paper, bedsteads made of
 wood, appearance finery expunged, chia cheng's
 heart naturally much gratified; nevertheless, scowling angrily
 pao-yü, "what think place?" asked.
 
party heard question, hastened stealthily give
 nudge pao-yü, express purpose inducing say it
 nice; pao-yü gave ear urged. "it's far
 spot," readily replied, "designated 'a phoenix comes with
 dignified air.'"
 
"you ignorant stupid thing!" exclaimed chia cheng words; "what
 simply fancy exquisite, despicable reliance yours
 upon luxury display, two-storied buildings painted pillars!
 can know anything aspect pure unobtrusive,
 failing studying books!"
 
"sir," hastily answered pao-yü, "your injunctions certainly correct;
 men old often made allusion 'natural;' is, i
 wonder, import two characters?"
 
company perceived perverse mind pao yü possessed, and
 one much surprised silly beyond
 possibility change; now heard question he
 asked, two characters representing "natural," they, one
 accord, speedily remarked, "everything else understand, is
 contrary know 'natural' implies? word
 'natural' means effected heaven made human labour."
 
"well, just so," rejoined pao-yü; "but farm, laid in
 locality, distinctly handiwork human labour; the
 distance, neighbouring hamlets; near it, adjoin wastes;
 though bears hill, hill destitute streaks; though be
 close water, water spring; above, pagoda
 nestling temple; below, bridge leading market; it
 rises abrupt solitary, presents grand sight! palm would
 seem carried former spot, imbued natural
 principle, possesses charms nature; for, though bamboos have
 planted it, streams introduced, nevertheless no
 violence works executed. 'a natural landscape,' says, ancient
 author four words; why? simply apprehended what
 land, would, forcible ways, converted land; that
 hill would, unnatural means, raised hill. and
 ingenious though works might hundred one ways, they
 cannot, all, harmony."...
 
time conclude, chia cheng flew rage. "drive
 off," shouted; (but pao-yü) point going out, he
 cried out: "come back! make up," added, "another couplet, and
 clear, give slap mouth."
 
pao-yü alternative recite follows:
 
spot "ko" fibre bleach, fresh tide doth swell
 waters green!
 beauteous halo fragrant smell man encompass cress
 pluck!
 
chia cheng, recital, nodded head. "this still worse!"
 remarked, reproved him, led company outside, and
 winding past mound, penetrated among flowers, wending their
 steps willows, touched rocks lingered stream.
 passing trellis yellow roses, went shed
 white roses; crossed pavilion peonies, walked
 garden, white peony grew; entering court
 cinnamon roses, reached island bananas. they
 meandered zigzagged, suddenly heard rustling sound the
 water, came stone cave, top grew
 parasitic plants drooping downwards, bottom floated the
 fallen flowers.
 
"what fine sight!" exclaimed; "what beautiful scenery!"
 
"gentlemen," observed chia cheng, "what name propose this
 place?"
 
"there's need deliberation," company rejoined; "for
 just spot fit three words 'wu ling spring.'"
 
"this matter-of-fact!" chia cheng objected laughingly, "and
 likewise antiquated."
 
"if do," party smiled, "well four
 characters implying 'an old cottage man ch'in dynasty?'"
 
"this still exceedingly plain!" interposed pao-yü. "'the old
 cottage man ch'in dynasty' meant imply retreat from
 revolution, will suit place? four
 characters better denoting 'an isthmus smart weed, stream
 flowers'?"
 
chia cheng heard words, exclaimed: "you're talking still
 stuff nonsense?" forthwith entering grotto, chia cheng
 went ask chia chen, "are boats not?"
 
"there be," replied chia chen, "four boats to
 pick lotus, one boat sitting in; now yet
 completed."
 
"what pity!" chia cheng answered smilingly, "that go in."
 
"but also get tortuous path hill," chia
 chen ventured; finishing remark, walked ahead show
 way, whole party went over, holding creepers, and
 supporting trees, saw still larger
 quantity fallen leaves surface water, stream
 itself, still limpid, gently idly meandering along its
 circuitous course. bank pond two rows weeping
 willows, which, intermingling peach apricot trees, screened the
 heavens view, kept rays sun spot,
 real truth devoid even grain dust.
 
suddenly, espied shade willows, arched wooden
 bridge also reveal eye, bannisters vermilion
 colour. crossed bridge, lo, paths lay open before
 them; gaze readily attracted brick cottage spotless
 cool-looking; whose walls constructed polished bricks, of
 uniform colour; (whose roof laid) speckless tiles; whose
 enclosing walls painted; minor slopes, branched off
 main hill, passed along walls other
 side.
 
"this house, site like this, perfectly destitute charm!"
 added chia cheng.
 
entered door, abruptly appeared facing them, large
 boulder studded holes soaring high skies, was
 surrounded four sides rocks every description, and
 completely, fact, hid view rooms situated compound.
 flowers trees, even one about; was
 visible strange kinds vegetation; the
 creeper genus, others parasitic plants, either hanging apex of
 hill, inserting base rocks; drooping
 even eaves house, entwining pillars, and
 closing round stone steps. like green bands, waved and
 flapped; like gold thread, coiled bent, either seeds
 resembling cinnabar, blossoms like golden olea; whose fragrance
 aroma equalled emitted flowers ordinary
 species.
 
"this pleasant!" chia cheng refrain saying; "the only
 thing know much flowers."
 
"what lianas ficus pumila!" company
 observed.
 
"how ever can liana ficus unusual scent?"
 questioned chia cheng.
 
"indeed aren't!" interposed pao-yü. "among flowers, there
 also ficus liana, scented ones iris, ligularia,
 'wu' flowers; kind consist, part, 'ch'ih'
 flowers orchids; mostly gold-coloured dolichos. that
 species hypericum plant, 'yü lu' creeper. red ones
 are, course, purple rue; green ones consist certain, of
 green 'chih' plant; and, best belief, various
 plants mentioned 'li sao' 'wen hsuan.' rare plants
 are, called something like 'huo na' 'chiang
 hui;' others designated something like 'lun tsu' 'tz'u
 feng;' others whose names sound like 'shih fan,' 'shui
 sung' 'fu liu,' together species found in
 'treatise wu city' tso t'ai-chung. also those
 go appellation 'lu t'i,' something like that;
 others called something like 'tan
 chiao,' 'mi wu' 'feng lien;' reference made the
 'treatise shu city.' many years now elapsed, the
 times changed (since treatises written), people,
 unable discriminate (the real names) may consequently had
 appropriate every case names suited external aspect,
 may, quite possible, gradually come called
 wrong designations."
 
time conclude; chia cheng interrupted him. "who has
 ever asked it?" shouted; plunged pao-yü a
 fright, drew back, venture utter another word.
 
chia cheng perceiving sides alike covered passages
 resembling outstretched arms, forthwith continued steps entered
 covered way, caught sight, upper end, a
 five-roomed building, without spot blemish, folding blinds
 extending connected line, corridors four sides; (a
 building) windows green, painted walls,
 excelled, spotless elegance, buildings seen
 before, presented contrast.
 
chia cheng heaved sigh. "if one able," observed, "to boil his
 tea thrum lyre here, even need him
 burn incense. execution structure so
 beyond conception must, gentlemen, compose something nice and
 original embellish tablet with, render place
 effect!"
 
"there's nothing really pat," suggested company smiling; "as 'the
 orchid-smell-laden breeze' 'the dew-bedecked epidendrum!"
 
"these indeed four characters," rejoined chia cheng, "that
 suitably used; said far scroll
 goes?"
 
"i've thought couplet," interposed one party, "which you'll
 criticise, put ship-shape; burden this:
 
"the musk-like epidendrum smell enshrouds court, shines the
 sun oblique beams;
 iris fragrance wafted isle illumined moon's
 clear rays."
 
"as far excellence concerned, excellent," observed whole
 party, "but two words representing 'with oblique beams' not
 felicitous."
 
one quoted line old poem:
 
angelica fills court tears, time sun doth slant.
 
"lugubrious, lugubrious!" expostulated company one voice.
 
another person interposed. "i also couplet, whose merits
 you, gentlemen, can weigh; runs follows:
 
"along three pathways doth float yü hui scented breeze!
 radiant moon whole hall shines gold orchid!"
 
chia cheng tugged moustache gave way meditation. was
 just also suggest stanza, when, upon suddenly raising his
 head, espied pao-yü standing side, timid give vent a
 single sound.
 
"how it," purposely exclaimed, "that speak, you
 contrariwise don't? likely expect one request you
 confer upon us favour instruction?"
 
"in place," pao-yü rejoined words, "there such
 things orchids, musk, resplendent moon islands; one to
 begin quoting specimens allusions, scenery, two hundred
 couplets readily given without, even then, able to
 exhaust supply!"
 
"who presses head down," chia cheng urged, "and uses force you
 must come remarks?"
 
"well, case," added pao-yü, "there fitter words put on
 tablet four representing: 'the fragrance pure the
 ligularia iris.' device scroll might be:
 
"sung nutmeg song, beauteous still sonnet!
 near t'u mei sleep, makes e'en dream fragrance full!"
 
"this is," laughed chia cheng sneeringly, "an imitation line:
 
"a book made plaintain leaves, writing green also
 bound be!
 
"so nothing remarkable it."
 
"li t'ai-po, work phoenix terrace," protested whole
 party, "copied, every point, huang hua lou. essential
 faultless imitation. now begin criticise minutely the
 couplet just cited, indeed find be, compared the
 line 'a book made plantain leaves,' still elegant and
 wider application!"
 
"what idea?" observed chia cheng derisively.
 
spoke, whole party walked out; gone very
 far caught sight majestic summer house, towering high
 peak-like, structure rising loftily storey upon storey;
 completely locked every side as
 beautiful jade palace. far wide, road upon road coiled and
 wound; green pines swept eaves, jady epidendrum
 encompassed steps, animals' faces glistened like gold, the
 dragons' heads shone resplendent variegated hues.
 
"this main hall," remarked chia cheng; "the word it
 little much finery."
 
"it so," rejoined one all, "so intended
 be! imperial consort has, true, exalted preference for
 economy frugality, present honourable position requires the
 observance courtesies, (finery) fault."
 
made remarks advanced way while, they
 perceived, just front them, archway project view,
 constructed jadelike stone; top coils large
 dragons scales small dragons executed perforated
 style.
 
"what's device spot?" inquired chia cheng.
 
"it 'fairy land,'" suggested them, "so be
 apposite!"
 
chia cheng nodded head said nothing. soon pao-yü
 caught sight spot something suddenly aroused heart
 began ponder within himself. "this place really resembles
 something seen somewhere other." the
 moment recall mind year, moon, day happened.
 
chia cheng bade propose motto; pao-yü bent upon
 thinking details scenery seen former
 occasion, gave thought whatever place, whole
 company loss construction give silence, and
 came simply conclusion that, bullying put
 ever long, spirits completely vanished, his
 talents become exhausted speech impoverished; he
 harassed pressed, might perchance, result anxiety,
 contract ailment other, course suitable
 issue, lost time combining together dissuade chia
 cheng.
 
"never mind," said, "to-morrow will compose device;
 drop now."
 
chia cheng inwardly afraid lest dowager lady chia be
 anxious, hastily remarked forced smile. "you beast,
 are, all, also occasions good! never
 mind! give one day in, to-morrow haven't
 able compose anything, shall certainly let off. this
 first foremost place must exercise due care what
 write."
 
saying this, sallied out, head company, cast
 another glance scenery.
 
indeed time entered gate stage, they
 just gone five six tenths whole ground, it
 happened servant came reported one had
 arrived mr. yü-'ts'un's deliver message. "these several places
 (which remain)," chia cheng observed smile, "we time to
 pass inspection; might well nevertheless go least
 way, shall able, certain degree, look at
 general aspect."
 
words, showed way family companions they
 reached large bridge, water entering it, looking like a
 curtain made crystal. bridge, fact is, dam, which
 communicated river outside, stream was
 introduced grounds.
 
"what's name water-gate?" chia cheng inquired.
 
"this is," replied pao-yü, "the main stream hsin fang river, and
 therefore called hsin fang water-gate."
 
"nonsense!" exclaimed chia cheng. "the two words hsin fang must no
 account used!"
 
speedily advanced way, either came across
 elegant halls, thatched cottages; walls made piled-up stone, or
 gates fashioned twisted plants; either secluded nunnery buddhist
 fane, foot hill; unsullied houses, hidden a
 grove, tenanted rationalistic priestesses; either extensive corridors
 winding grottoes; square buildings, circular pavilions. but
 chia cheng energy enter places, he
 rest ever long, legs felt shaky feet
 weak.
 
suddenly also discerned ahead court disclose to
 view.
 
"when get there," chia cheng suggested, "we must little rest."
 straightway uttered remark, led in, winding round
 jade-green peach-trees, covered blossom, passed through
 bamboo fence flower-laden hedge, twisted a
 way form circular, cavelike gateway, unexpectedly appeared
 eyes enclosure whitewashed walls, verdant
 willows drooped every direction.
 
chia cheng entered gateway company whole party. along
 whole length sides extended covered passages, connected with
 other; court laid several rockeries. one
 quarter planted number banana trees; opposite stood a
 plant begonia hsi fu. appearance like open umbrella.
 gossamer hanging (from branches) resembled golden threads. the
 corollas (seemed) spurt cinnabar.
 
"what beautiful flower! beautiful flower!" ejaculated whole
 party one voice; "begonias verily found; never before
 seen anything like beauty."
 
"this called maiden begonia is, fact, foreign species,"
 chia cheng observed. "there's homely tradition it
 emanates maiden kingdom flowers prolific; but
 likewise erratic talk devoid common sense."
 
"they are, all," rejoined whole company, "so unlike others (we
 seen), said maiden kingdom is, are
 inclined believe, possibly fact."
 
"i presume," interposed pao-yü, "that clever bard poet,
 (perceiving) flower red like cosmetic, delicate if
 propped sickness, closely resembled nature a
 young lady, gave it, consequently, name maiden! people the
 world will propagate idle tales, unavoidably treated as
 gospel!"
 
"we receive (with thanks) instructions; excellent
 explanation!" remarked unanimously, expressed these
 words, whole company took seats sofas the
 colonnade.
 
"let's think original text motto," chia cheng
 suggested, one companions opined two characters:
 "banana stork" felicitous; another one the
 idea faultless be: "collected splendour and
 waving elegance!"
 
"'collected splendour waving elegance' excellent," chia cheng
 observed addressing party; pao-yü himself, also
 extolling beautiful, went say: "there's one thing
 however regretted!"
 
"what regret?" company inquired.
 
"in place," pao-yü explained, "are set bananas well as
 begonias, intent secretly combining two
 properties red green; mention one made, and
 omitted, (the device) good enough selection."
 
"what suggest?" chia cheng asked.
 
"i submit four words, 'the red (flowers) fragrant, the
 green (banana leaves) like jade,' render complete the
 beauties (the begonias bananas)."
 
"it good! good!" chia cheng remonstrated shook his
 head; passing remark, conducted party the
 house, noticed internal arrangements effected
 differed places, partitions could, fact, be
 discerned. indeed, four sides alike covered boards
 carved hollow fretwork, (in designs consisting) either rolling
 clouds hundreds bats; three friends cold season
 year, (fir, bamboo almond); scenery human beings, or
 birds flowers; either clusters decoration, relics of
 olden times; either ten thousand characters happiness ten
 thousand characters longevity. various kinds designs been
 carved renowned hands, variegated colours, inlaid gold,
 studded precious gems; shelf upon shelf either
 arranged collections books, tripods laid out; either pens and
 inkslabs distributed about, vases flowers set out, or
 figured pots placed about; designs shelves either
 round square; similar sunflowers banana leaves; like
 links, half overlapping other. truth resembled
 bouquets flowers clusters tapestry, fretwork so
 transparent. suddenly (the eye struck) variegated gauzes pasted
 (on wood-work), actually forming small windows; sudden by
 fine thin silks lightly overshadowing (the fretwork) just there
 were, all, secret doors. whole walls addition traced,
 regard symmetry, outlines shapes curios and
 nick-nacks imitation lutes, double-edged swords, hanging bottles
 like, whole number which, though (apparently) suspended
 walls, however level surface the
 partition walls.
 
"what fine ingenuity!" exclaimed extollingly; "what labour
 must carry out!"
 
chia cheng actually stepped in; scarcely reached the
 second stage, whole party readily lost sight way by
 come in. glanced left, stood a
 door, go. cast eyes right,
 window suddenly impeded progress. went
 forward, obstructed bookcase. turned
 heads round, stood windows pasted transparent
 gauze available door-ways: moment came face face
 door, unexpectedly perceived whole company of
 people likewise walked in, just front them, whose appearance
 resembled every respect. mirror. when
 rounded mirror, detected still larger number doors.
 
"sir," chia chen remarked grin; "if follow through
 door, forthwith get back-court; the
 back-court, shall be, events, nearer before."
 
taking lead, conducted chia cheng whole party round two
 gauze mosquito houses, verily espied door they
 made exit, court, replete stands cinnamon roses.
 passing round flower-laden hedge, thing spread before
 view pure stream impeding advance. whole company
 lost admiration. "where water issue from?" they
 cried.
 
chia chen pointed spot distance. "starting originally," he
 explained, "from water-gate, runs far mouth that
 cave, among hills north-east side, introduced
 village, diverging channel opened and
 made flow south-westerly direction; whole volume of
 water runs spot, collecting one place,
 issues, outward course, beneath wall."
 
"it's ingenious!" one exclaimed, had
 listened him; but, uttered words, unawares
 realised lofty hill obstructed progress. whole
 party felt hazy right road. "come along me,"
 chia chen smilingly urged, went ahead showed way,
 whereupon company followed steps, soon turned
 round foot hill, level place broad road lay before
 them; wide faces appeared main entrance.
 
"this charming! delightful!" party unanimously exclaimed,
 "what wits must ransacked, ingenuity attained, to
 bring things extreme degree excellence!"
 
forthwith party egressed garden, pao-yü's heart
 anxiously longed society young ladies inner
 quarters, hear chia cheng bid go, help
 follow library. suddenly chia cheng bethought
 him. "what," said, "you gone yet! old lady
 will fear anxious account; pray haven't
 yet enough walking?"
 
pao-yü length withdrew library. arrival the
 court, page, attendance chia cheng, pressed
 forward, took hold fast arms. "you've lucky
 enough," said, "to-day master's good graces! just a
 back old mistress despatched servants come several
 occasions ask you, replied master pleased with
 you; given answer, ladyship sent to
 fetch go in, opportunity of
 displaying talents. every one admits several stanzas you
 recently composed superior whole company put
 together; must, good luck to-day, give us a
 tip!"
 
"i'll give one tiao," pao-yü rejoined smirkingly.
 
"who us seen tiao?" exclaimed, "let's that
 purse yours, done it!"
 
saying this, one one advanced proceeded unloosen purse,
 unclasp fan-case; allowing pao-yü time make any
 remonstrance, stripped every ornament way of
 appendage carried person. "whatever let's
 escort home!" shouted, one another hustled round him
 accompanied far dowager lady chia's door.
 
ladyship moment awaiting arrival, she
 saw walk in, found (chia cheng) bullied
 him, felt, course, extremely delighted. long interval
 elapsed hsi jen came serve tea; perceived
 person one ornaments remained, consequently
 smiled inquired: "have things again
 taken away barefaced rascals?"
 
soon lin tai-yü heard remark, crossed saw
 glance one single trinket was, fact, left. "have you
 also given them," felt constrained ask, "the purse gave
 you? well, by, covet anything mine, shan't
 let it."
 
uttering words, returned apartment high
 dudgeon, taking scented bag, pao-yü asked make
 him, yet finished, picked pair of
 scissors, instantly cut pieces.
 
pao-yü noticing lost temper, came with
 hurried step, bag already cut scissors; as
 pao-yü observed extremely fine artistic scented bag was, in
 spite unfinished state, verily deplored have
 rent pieces rhyme reason. promptly therefore

imperial consort chia family, must now observe, upon
 catching sight, interior chair, picture presented

 heaved sigh. "what lavish extravagance! excessive waste!" she
 soliloquised.
 
sudden seen eunuch who, knees, invited her

 stepped craft, expanse limpid stream met her
 gaze, whose grandeur resembled dragon listless

entered landing stone curb; landing was
 erected flat lantern upon plainly visible four
 characters "persicary beach flower-laden bank." but, reader, you
 heard four characters "the persicary beach the
 flower-laden bank," motto "a phoenix comes dignified air," and
 rest owe one origin unexpected test which
 chia cheng submitted, previous occasion, pao-yü's literary
 abilities; come actually adopted?
 
must remember chia family been, generation after
 generation, given study letters, natural
 among one two renowned writers verses;
 ever resemble families upstarts, only
 employ puerile expressions makeshift get have
 do? wherefore must sought past. the
 consort, belonging chia mansion, had, entered the
 palace, been, infancy, also brought dowager lady chia;
 pao-yü subsequently added family, eldest
 sister pao-yü youngest child. chia consort, bearing mind
 had, mother verging old age, length
 obtained younger brother, reason doated upon with
 single love; besides companions attendance
 upon old lady chia, inseparable even moment. before
 pao-yü entered school, three four years age, had
 already received oral instruction imperial spouse chia the
 contents several books committed memory several thousands

 wont time letters taken father her
 cousins, urgently recommending careful bringing up,
 strict, possibly become good for
 anything, immoderately severe, the
 danger something unpropitious befalling him, result,
 moreover, grandmother stricken sorrow; this
 solicitude account never instant lost sight her.
 
hence chia cheng having, days back, heard teacher
 extol extreme abilities, forthwith put test on
 occasion ramble garden. though (his
 compositions) bold style writer note, yet they
 productions family, would, moreover, be
 instrumental, chia consort notice attracted them,
 come know devised beloved brother, also
 rendering nugatory anxious interest ever
 entertained behalf, he, therefore, purposely adopted had
 suggested pao-yü; places, day
 devices completed, good number subsequently
 composed make wanted.
 
chia consort had, shall now return her, perused the
 four characters, gave smile. "the two words 'flower-laden bank,'"
 said, "are really felicitous, use 'persicary
 beach?'"
 
eunuch waiting heard observation, promptly jumped
 craft bank, flying pace hurried to
 communicate chia cheng, chia cheng instantly effected the
 necessary alteration.
 
time craft reached inner bank, leaving boat,
 mounting sedan chair, due course contemplated the
 magnificent jade-like palace; hall cinnamon wood, lofty and

 musk deer; screens row resembling fans made pheasant
 tails. indeed, gold-like doors windows like jade were
 suggestive abode spirits; halls made cinnamon
 wood palace magnolia timber, homes the
 imperial secondary consorts.
 
"why it," chia consort inquired, "that tablet this
 hall?"
 
eunuch waiting fell knees. "this main hall," he
 reverently replied, "and officials, outside palace, not
 presume take upon suggest motto."
 
chia consort shook head said word; whereupon the
 eunuch, acted master ceremonies, requested majesty to
 ascend throne receive homage. band stationed two
 flights steps struck tune, two eunuchs ushered chia she,

tea thrice presented, chia consort descended the
 throne, music ceased. retired side room change her

 utterance feelings, sob weep, as
 kept face face other; madame hsing, widow li wan,
 wang hsi-feng, three sisters: ying ch'un, t'an ch'un, hsi
 ch'un, stood aside body shedding tears saying word.
 
long time, chia consort restrained anguish, forcing
 smile, set work reassure old lady chia madame wang.
 "having days gone by," urged, "been sent place no
 human can seen, to-day extreme difficulty returned
 home; now ladies reunited, instead of
 chatting laughing contrariwise give way incessant tears! but
 shortly, shall gone, knows shall able to

came sentence, help bursting into
 another tit crying; madame hsing hastened come forward, to
 console dowager lady chia rest. chia consort

 time.
 
next order, managers servants eastern western
 mansions perform obeisance outer pavilion; the
 married women waiting-maids concluded homage, chia
 consort heaved sigh. "how many relatives," observed, "there are
 whom, alas! may see."
 
"there now," madame wang rejoined due respect, "kindred

"as nearer place," ming yen observed; "to whose house can we

hsi jen's mother had, occasion, united home hsi jen,

 engaged partaking fruits tea, heard some
 one outside call out, "brother hua." hua tzu-fang lost time in
 rushing out; upon looking finding two them,
 master servant, taken surprise fears
 set rest. promptly, clasped pao-yü arms and
 dismounted him, coming court, shouted top of

"i felt awfully dull," pao-yü rejoined smile, "and came see

hsi jen words banished, last, anxiety mind.
 "you're larks," observed, "but aim of
 visit? else come along him?" time went
 question ming yen.
 
"all others know nothing it!" explained ming yen exultingly;
 "only two do, all."
 
hsi jen heard remark, gave way afresh solicitous fears:
 "this dreadful!" added; "for come across one from
 house, meet master; were, streets, people press
 you, horses collide you, make (his horse) shy,
 fall, joke? gall you
 larger peck measure; you, ming yen, has
 incited him, go back, surely tell nurses beat

ming yen pouted mouth. "mr. secundus," pleaded, "abused and
 beat me, bade bring here, now shoves blame my
 shoulders! 'don't let us go,' suggested; 'but insist, well
 let us go done.'"
 
hua tzu-fang promptly interceded. "let things alone," said; "now that
 already here, need whatever much ado. only
 thing mean house thatched roof crammed
 filthy you, sir, sit it!"
 
hsi jen's mother also came early period receive him, and
 hsi jen pulled pao-yü in. inside room, pao-yü perceived three
 five girls, who, soon caught sight approaching, all
 lowered heads, felt bashful faces suffused
 blushes. hua tzu-fang mother afraid that
 pao-yü catch cold, pressed take seat the
 stove-bed, hastened serve fresh supply refreshments, to
 bring cup good tea.
 
"you needn't flurrying nothing," hsi jen smilingly
 interposed; "i, naturally, know; use even
 laying fruits, daren't recklessly give anything to

saying this, simultaneously took cushion laid a
 stool, pao-yü took seat it, placed footstove she
 using, feet; producing, satchet, two
 peach-blossom-scented small cakes, opened hand-stove and
 threw fire; done, covered well and
 placed pao-yü's lap. eventually, filled tea-cup
 tea presented pao-yü, while, time, mother
 sister fussing about, laying fine array tableful
 every kind eatables.
 
hsi jen noticed absolutely things eat,
 felt urged say smile: "since come, isn't
 right go empty away; must, whether things be
 good bad, taste little, may look like visit my
 house!"
 
said this, forthwith took several seeds fir-cone, and
 cracking thin skin, placed handkerchief and
 presented pao-yü. pao-yü, espying hsi jen's two eyes
 slightly red, powder shiny moist, quietly
 therefore inquired hsi jen, "why cry rhyme reason?"
 
"why cry?" hsi jen laughed; "something just got eyes
 rubbed them." means readily managed evade
 detection; seeing pao-yü wore deep red archery-sleeved
 pelisse, ornamented gold dragons, lined fur foxes'
 ribs grey sable fur surtout fringe round border. "what!

 come here? inquire going?"
 
"i changed," pao-yü explained grin, "as mr. chen invited
 go look play."
 
"well, sit go back;" hsi jen continued nodded
 head; "for place come to!"
 
"you'd better going home now," pao-yü suggested smirkingly; "where
 kept something good you."
 
"gently," smiled hsi jen, "for let hear, figure

 unclasping pao-yü's neck jade spiritual perception, she
 faced cousins remarked exultingly. "here! see yourselves;
 look learn! repeatedly talked it, all
 thought extraordinary, anxious glance it;
 to-day, may gaze might, whatever precious
 thing may come see will really never excel an

finished speaking, handed them, after
 passed round inspection, fastened properly
 pao-yü's neck, also bade brother go hire small
 carriage, engage small chair, escort pao-yü back home.
 
"if see back," hua tzu-fang remarked, "there harm,
 even ride horse!"
 
"it harm," hsi jen replied; "but may come
 across one house."
 
hua tzu-fang promptly went bespoke small chair; came

 course see pao-yü house; hsi jen, other

 time pressed hand several cash buy crackers let

hua tzu-fang, upon hearing good reason said,

 putting aside details, will now confine pao-yü.

 game cards; covered whole floor shells of
 melon-seeds cracking, dame li, nurse, happened to
 come in, propping staff, pay respects see
 pao-yü, perceiving pao-yü home the
 servant-girls bent upon romping, felt intensely disgusted.
 "since left place," therefore exclaimed sigh, "and
 often come here, become unmannerly; the
 nurse still less ever venture expostulate you;
 pao-yü like candlestick eighty feet high, shedding light others,
 throwing none upon himself! knows look upon people

servant-girls well aware pao-yü particular in
 respects, next place nurse li, pleaded old
 age, resigned place gone home, nowadays control over
 them, simply gave minds romping joking, and
 paid heed whatever her. nurse li however still kept asking
 pao-yü, "how much rice now ate one meal? time he
 went sleep?" questions, servant-girls replied quite at
 random; observed: "what dreadful despicable
 old thing is!"
 
"in covered bowl," continued inquire, "is cream, not
 give eat?" concluded words, took up
 began eating it.
 
"be quick, leave alone!" servant-girl expostulated, "that, he
 said, kept order given hsi jen; return, when
 gets huff, you, old lady, must, motion,
 confess eaten it, involve us way to
 bear resentment."
 
nurse li, words, felt angry ashamed. "i can't
 believe," forthwith remarked, "that become bad heart!

spoke, flew temper, taking cream drank the
 whole it.
 
"they know speak properly!" another servant-girl interposed
 sarcastically, "and wonder you, old lady, get angry!
 pao-yü still sends you, venerable dame, presents proof his
 gratitude, possible will feel displeased a
 thing like this?"
 
"you girls also pretend artful flatterers cajole me!"
 nurse li added; "do imagine aware dismissal, the
 day, hsi hsüeh, account cup tea? clear
 enough incurred blame, come receive it!"
 
said this, went dudgeon, long interval
 elapsed pao-yü returned, gave orders go fetch hsi jen;
 perceiving ching ling reclining bed perfectly still: "i
 presume ill," pao-yü felt constrained inquire, "or isn't
 ill, must lost cards."
 
"not so!" observed chiu wen; "she winner, dame li came in
 quite casually muddled lost; angry she
 rushed sleep."
 
"don't place yourselves," pao-yü smiled, "on footing nurse
 li, let alone, everything will right."
 
words still lips hsi jen arrived. the
 mutual salutations, hsi jen went ask pao-yü: "where you
 repast? time come back?" present
 likewise, behalf mother sister, compliments the
 girls, companions. short while, changed her
 costume divested fineries, pao-yü bade fetch
 cream.
 
"nurse li eaten it," servant-girls rejoined, pao-yü was
 point making remark hsi jen hastened interfere,
 laughing while; "is really kept me? many
 thanks trouble; day, some, found very
 toothsome, partaken it, got pain stomach,
 much upset, brought up
 felt right. well it, for, it
 kept here, wasted use! fancy
 dry chestnuts; clean me, go lay the
 bed!"
 
pao-yü upon hearing words credited true, he
 discarded thought cream fetched chestnuts, he,
 hands, selected pealed. perceiving time
 none party present room, put smile and
 inquired hsi jen: "who persons dressed red day?"
 
"they're two cousins mother's side," hsi jen explained, and
 hearing this, pao-yü sang praise heaved couple sighs.
 
"what sighing for?" hsi jen remarked. "i know secret reasons
 heart; fancy fit wear red!"
 
"it that," pao-yü protested smilingly, "it that; a
 person good enough dressed red, would
 forsooth presume wear it? find really lovely!
 could, all, manage get family, nice
 then!"
 
hsi jen gave sardonic smile. "that fate slave
 matter, likely destiny even very
 relatives become one bond servants? you
 certainly set choice upon really beautiful girl, for
 case good enough enter house."
 
"here touchiness!" pao-yü eagerly exclaimed
 smiling, "if said come house, it
 necessarily imply servant? were
 mention come relative!"
 
"that exalt fit match you!" rejoined hsi
 jen; pao-yü loth continue conversation, simply busied
 cleaning chestnuts.
 
"how utter word?" hsi jen laughed; "i expect it's
 just offended inconsiderate talk! by
 purpose fixed it, just spend ounces silver to
 purchase with, bring done!"
 
"how one make reply?" pao-yü smilingly rejoined; "all
 extol charms; really fit born in
 deep hall spacious court this; foul
 things others contrariwise spend days this
 place!"
 
"though deprived good fortune," hsi jen explained, "she's
 nevertheless also petted indulged jewel maternal uncle
 aunt! now seventeen years age, everything way
 trousseau got ready, get married next year."
 
upon hearing two words "get married," repress himself
 ejaculating: "hai hai!" unhappy frame
 mind, heard hsi jen remark heaved sigh: "ever
 since come here, cousins years able to
 get live together, now return home, they, on
 hand, will gone!"
 
pao-yü, realising lurked remark meaning or
 other, suddenly taken aback dropping chestnuts, he
 inquired: "how now want go back?"
 
"i present to-day," hsi jen explained, "when mother brother held
 consultation together, bade patient another year, and
 next year come redeem service!"
 
pao-yü, words, felt distressed. "why want to
 redeem you?" consequently asked.
 
"this strange question!" hsi jen retorted, "for really be
 treated issue born homestead yours! the
 members family elsewhere, this
 place, end days here?"
 
"if let go, will verily difficult get
 away!" pao-yü replied.
 
"there never principle action!" urged hsi jen; "even
 imperial palace itself, fixed rule, possibly
 every certain number years selection (of go takes
 place), every certain number years new batch enters; and
 practice keeping people ever; to
 speak home."
 
pao-yü realised, reflection, she, point fact, was
 right, went observe: "should old lady give your
 release, will impossible get off."
 
"why release me?" hsi jen questioned. "am really very
 extraordinary person perchance made impression upon
 venerable ladyship lady will positive not
 letting go? may, likelihood, give family more
 ounces silver keep here; possibly may come about. but, in
 truth, also person ordinary run, many
 superior me, yea many! ever since youth up, in
 old ladyship's service; first waiting upon miss shih several
 years, recently attendance upon another term of
 years; now people will come redeem me, should, a
 matter right, told go. idea even redemption
 money accepted, will display grace let
 go once. and, told allowed go as
 diligent service you, thing can no
 account come about! faithful attendance obligation my
 duties, exceptional service! gone again
 faithful attendant, likely no
 here, find impracticable obtain one!"
 
pao-yü listened various arguments, proved the
 reasonableness going unreasonableness detention,
 felt heart ever prey distress. "in spite all
 say," therefore continued, "the sole desire heart to
 detain you; doubt old lady will speak your
 mother it; give mother ample money,
 she'll, course, feel well decency
 take home!"
 
"my mother naturally audacity headstrong!" hsi jen
 ventured, "not speak besides nice things, may told
 lots money may, addition, given; she
 even paid compliments, much single cash
 given her, won't, set mind upon keeping here, presume
 comply wishes, also inclination. one
 thing however; family never rely upon prestige, trust upon
 honorability anything domineering this! like
 anything else, which, take fancy it, hundred per cent
 profit can added, obtained you! action can well
 taken seller suffer loss! present instance,
 keep back rhyme reason, also no
 benefit yourself; contrary, instrumental in
 keeping us blood relatives far apart; thing like which, feel
 positive dowager lady chia lady will never do!"
 
lending ear argument, pao-yü cogitated within himself
 while. "from say," observed, "when say you'll
 go, means go certain!"
 
"yes, go certain," hsi jen rejoined.
 
"who anticipated," pao-yü, words, mused his
 heart, "that person like shown little sense of
 gratitude, lack respect! i," remarked aloud
 sigh, "been aware, early date, whole wish would
 go, wouldn't, case, brought over! but
 away, shall remain alone, solitary spirit!"
 
spoke, lost control temper, and, getting bed, he
 went sleep.
 
fact hsi jen home, heard mother
 brother express intention redeeming back, and
 observed even point death, not
 return home. "when past days," argued, "you rice to
 eat, remained myself, still worth several taels; and
 urged sell me, seen father and
 mother die starvation eyes? now good
 fortune selling place, fed clothed just
 like mistress, beaten day, abused night!
 besides, though now father more, two anyhow putting
 things straight again, adjusted family estate resumed
 primitive condition. you, fact, still straitened
 circumstances, redeeming back, make more
 money, well good; truth no
 need, use redeem time
 this? temporarily treat dead gone, shouldn't
 recall idea redeeming me!"
 
consequence indulged loud fit crying, mother and
 brother resolved, perceived determined frame of
 mind, fact need come service.
 sold contract death, the
 distinct reliance chia family, charitable generous family
 was, would, possibly, entreaties, make
 present person well purchase money. the
 second place, never chia mansion ill-used those
 below; always plenty grace little imperiousness.
 besides, servant-girls, acted personal attendants the
 apartments old well young, treated far
 unlike whole body domestics household daughters
 even ordinary penniless parentage so
 looked to. considerations induced mother well
 dispel intention redeem her, and
 pao-yü subsequently paid unexpected visit, two
 (pao-yü hsi jen) seen also terms, the
 mother obtained clearer insight relations, and
 still one burden (which pressed mind) fell the
 ground, besides contingency, never
 reckoned upon, composed hearts, again
 entertain idea ransoming her.
 
must noticed moreover hsi jen ever since youth not
 blind fact pao-yü extraordinary temperament,
 self-willed perverse, far even excess young
 lads, had, addition, good many peculiarities many
 unspeakable defects. late placed reliance the
 fond love grandmother father mother even not

 tai-yü time quite alone, reclining bed a
 midday siesta, waiting-maids gone attend to

 silence. pao-yü raised embroidered soft thread portiere walked
 in; upon espying tai-yü room fast asleep, hurriedly
 approached pushing her: "dear cousin," said, "you've just had
 meal, asleep already?" kept calling "tai-yü"
 till woke sleep.
 
perceiving pao-yü, "you better go stroll," tai-yü
 urged, "for day yesterday disturbed whole night,

 whole body feels languid sore."
 
"this languor soreness," pao-yü rejoined, "are consequence;
 go sleeping feeling ill; try and
 distract you, dispelled lassitude, all

tai-yü closed eyes. "i feel lassitude," explained,
 "all want little rest; better go elsewhere come

"where can go?" pao-yü asked pushed her. "i'm quite sick and
 tired seeing others."
 
words, tai-yü burst laughing sound ch'ih. "well!
 since wish remain here," added, "go sit down
 quietly, chat."
 
"i'll also recline," pao-yü suggested.
 
"well, then, recline!" tai-yü assented.
 
"there's pillow," observed pao-yü, "so let us lie same
 pillow."
 
"what nonsense!" tai-yü urged, "aren't pillows outside? get one
 lie it."
 
pao-yü walked outer apartment, looked him, he
 returned remarked smile: "i want those, may be,
 aught know, dirty old hag's."
 
tai-yü remark opened eyes wide, raised herself
 up: "you're really," exclaimed laughingly, "the evil star my
 existence! here, please recline pillow!" uttered
 words, pushed pillow towards pao-yü, and, getting up
 went fetched another own, upon lay head in

 tai-yü, upon turning eyes looking, espied pao-yü's cheek

 button, speedily bending body, drew near him, rubbing
 hand, scrutinised closely. "whose nail," went on
 inquire, "has scratched open?"
 
pao-yü body still reclining withdrew reach, he

saying this, tried get handkerchief wipe off; but

pao-yü least heed said, intent upon
 smelling subtle scent which, point fact, emanated tai-yü's
 sleeve, inhaled inebriated soul paralysed bones.
 snatch, pao-yü laid hold tai-yü's sleeve meaning see what
 object concealed it; tai-yü smilingly expostulated: "at such
 time this," said, "who keeps scents one?"
 
"well, case," pao-yü rejoined smirking face, "where does
 scent come from?"
 
"i know," tai-yü replied; "i presume must be, no
 saying, scent press impregnated clothes."
 
"it follow," pao-yü added, shook head; "the fumes of
 smell peculiar, resemble perfume of
 scent-bottles, scent-balls, scented satchets!"
 
"is likely have, like others, buddhistic disciples," tai-yü
 asked laughing ironically, "or worthies give novel kinds of
 scents? supposing peculiar scent, haven't,
 events, older younger brothers get flowers, buds,
 dew, snow, concoct me; common
 scents, all."
 
"whenever utter single remark," pao-yü urged grin, "you at
 bring insinuations; unless deal you
 severely, never know stuff made of; henceforth
 show grace!"
 
spoke, turned over, raising himself, puffed a
 couple breaths hands, hastily stretching out,
 tickled tai-yü promiscuously armpits, along sides.
 tai-yü never able stand tickling, pao-yü put
 two hands tickled violently, forthwith giggled to
 extent scarcely gasp breath. "if still go
 teasing me," shouted, "i'll get angry you!"
 
pao-yü kept hands off, laughed, "tell me," asked,
 "will come words not?"
 
"i daren't again," tai-yü smiled adjusted hair; adding
 another laugh: "i may peculiar scents, 'warm'

pao-yü question, time unfold meaning: "what
 'warm' scent?" therefore asked.
 
tai-yü nodded head smiled deridingly. "how stupid! fool!"
 sighed; "you jade, another person gold match with
 you, one 'cold' scent, 'warm' scent a

pao-yü stage alone understood import remark.
 
"a short back craved mercy," pao-yü observed smilingly,
 "and now going talking worse ever;" spoke

"dear cousin," tai-yü speedily implored smirk, "i venture

"as letting off," pao-yü remarked laughing, "i'll readily let

 uttering words, hastily pulled sleeve, pressing it
 face, kept smelling incessantly, whereupon tai-yü drew
 hand away urged: "you must going now!"
 
"though may wish go, can't," pao-yü smiled, "so let us now
 lie propriety chat," laying again,
 spoke, tai-yü likewise reclined, covered face with
 handkerchief. pao-yü rambling way gave vent lot of
 nonsense, tai-yü heed, pao-yü went inquire: "how
 old came capital? sights antiquities
 saw journey? relics curiosities yang
 chou? local customs habits people?"
 
tai-yü made reply; pao-yü fearing lest go sleep,
 get ill, readily set work beguile keep awake. "ai yah!"
 exclaimed, "at yang chou, official residence is, has
 occurred remarkable affair; heard it?"
 
tai-yü perceiving spoke earnest, words correct
 face serious, imagined referred true
 story, therefore inquired was?
 
pao-yü upon hearing ask question, forthwith suppressed laugh,
 and, glib tongue, began spin yarn. "at yang chou," he
 said, "there's hill called tai hill; hill stands a
 cave called lin tzu."
 
"this must lies," tai-yü answered sneeringly, "as never
 heard hill."
 
"under heavens many hills rivers," pao-yü rejoined, "and
 know all? wait done speaking, you
 will free express opinion!"
 
"go then," tai-yü suggested, whereupon pao-yü prosecuted his
 raillery. "in lin tzu cave," said, "there upon time a
 whole swarm rat-elves. year seventh day

 'tomorrow,' argued, 'is eighth twelfth moon, men in

 drawing another mandatory arrow, asked go abstract the

 'how ingenious they?' whole company rats
 asked. 'i won't,' explained young rat, 'follow example, go

 suggesting: "it's well wrangle nurse,
 quite stupid old age; fair, contrary,

"i know that!" pao-yü rejoined. concluded this
 remark, walked room, discovered nurse li, leaning
 staff, standing centre floor, abusing hsi jen,
 saying: "you young wench! utterly unmindful origin!

 couple waiting-maids, standing below; one whom, slightly
 older other, exceedingly winsome.
 
"what's name?" pao-yü eagerly inquired.
 
"i'm called hui hsiang, (orchid fragrance)," waiting-maid rejoined
 simperingly.

ssu erh was, thought it, girl gifted with
 matchless artfulness, perceiving pao-yü requisitioned her

"do still remember to-day!" pao-yü asked smirk.
 
"hundred years hence shall still bear mind," hsi jen protested;
 "i'm like you, treat words much wind blowing the

hsi jen immediately picked hair-pin, remarked: "what's up

"how can know," pao-yü answered, "the anguish heart!"
 
"do also know anguish means?" hsi jen observed laughing; "if

"i have!" p'ing erh assented.
 
"is anything short not?" lady feng inquired.
 
"i've carefully looked them," p'ing erh added, "and found

"is anything excess?" lady feng went ascertain.
 
p'ing erh laughed. "it's enough," rejoined, "that nothing

"that half month," lady feng continued still smiling, "things have

 entreating screen him; p'ing erh pretended notice him,
 consequently observed smiling: "how ideas should

"you fool!" lady feng laughed, "had things sort, he

"this," observed p'ing erh, tress hand, "will my

"you needn't dread her!" chia lien urged; "wait till monkey up,
 take jealous woman, beat atoms; then

"if jealous, every reason," p'ing erh answered, "but for
 jealous account right. conduct really

"you two," continued chia lien, "have mouth full malicious breath!

"it's just proper thing one else! it?"
 lady feng remarked grinning sarcastically.
 
"do words allude me?" p'ing erh hastily asked, soon she
 heard said.
 
lady feng forthwith laughed. "if allude you," she
 continued, "to they?"
 
"don't press come nice things!" p'ing erh
 insinuated, and, spoke, even raise portiere (for

chia lien, must now prosecute story, upon hearing lady feng
 observe something consult him, felt
 constrained halt inquire about.
 
"on 21st," lady feng explained, "is cousin hsüeh's birthday, and
 you, all, purpose doing?"
 
"do know do?" exclaimed chia lien; "you made, time and
 again, arrangements ever many birthdays grown-up people, and
 you, really, find occasion without resources?"
 
"birthdays grown-up people subject prescribed rules," lady
 feng expostulated; "but present birthday neither one adult
 infant, like deliberate with
 you!"
 
chia lien upon hearing remark, lowered head gave to
 protracted reflection. "you're indeed grown dull!" cried; "why you've
 precedent ready hand suit case! cousin lin's birthday
 affords precedent, former years cousin lin,
 can instance likewise cousin hsüeh, will be
 right."
 
words lady feng gave sarcastic smile. "do you, pray, mean to
 insinuate," added, "that aware even this! had
 previously come, thought, conclusion; old lady
 chia explained, hearing yesterday, made inquiries
 ages birthdays, learnt cousin hsüeh
 year fifteen, though birthday,
 made age, anyhow well regarded the
 dawn year, gather hair, our
 dowager lady enjoined anniversary should, matter of
 course, celebrated, unlike cousin lin."
 
"well, case," chia lien suggested, "you better make few
 additions done cousin lin!"
 
"that's thinking of," lady feng replied, "and why
 asking views; i, hook, add anything you
 feel hurt explained things you."
 
"that will do, will do!" chia lien rejoined laughing, "none of
 sham attentions me! long pry doings it
 will enough; will go far bear grudge?"
 
words still mouth, forthwith went off. leaving

 said: "wait seen theatrical performance, when

 spent upon us, go far place us any
 perplexities (by compelling us subscribe). now enough for
 wines, enough theatricals?"
 
bandied words, every one whole room burst out
 laughing, even dowager lady chia broke laughter she
 observed: "do listen mouth? looked upon as
 gift gab, talk a
 wise put monkey? mother-in-law dare
 overbearing speech; jabber, jabber with
 me!"
 
"my mother-in-law," explained lady feng, "is also fond pao-yü as
 are, much anywhere go give vent to
 grievances; instead (showing regard) say i'm
 overbearing speech!"
 
words, enticed dowager lady chia laugh a
 while. old lady continued highest spirits, and, when
 evening came, appeared presence pay their
 obeisance, ladyship made point, whole company of
 ladies young ladies engaged chatting, ascertain of
 pao-ch'ai play liked hear, things fancied to

pao-ch'ai well aware dowager lady chia, well years though

 reclining stove-couch. "get up," pao-yü pressed a
 smile, "and come breakfast, plays will commence
 shortly; whichever plays like listen to, tell so

tai-yü smiled sarcastically. "in case," rejoined, "you had
 better specially engage troupe select like sung my
 benefit; occasion impertinent make use

"what's impossible this?" pao-yü answered smiling; "well,
 to-morrow readily wish, ask make use of

passed remark, pulled up, taking hand his
 own, walked room came breakfast. the
 time arrived make selection plays, dowager lady chia her
 motion first asked pao-ch'ai mark liked; though
 time pao-ch'ai declined, yielding choice others, no
 alternative decide, fixing upon play called, "the record the

 order, bade lady feng choose, lady feng, had, all, in
 spite madame wang ranking precedence, consider old
 lady chia's request, presume show obstinacy any

dowager lady chia was, course, still elated. she
 speedily went ask tai-yü choose. tai-yü likewise concedingly
 yielded turn favour madame wang seniors, make
 selections her, old lady expostulated. "to-day,"
 said, "is primarily occasion, brought you
 special recreation; better look own
 selves heed them! i, imagine, gone the
 trouble performance laying feast special
 benefit? already reaping benefit enough here,
 listening plays partaking banquet, no
 right either; pressed make choice of

words, whole company hearty laugh; which,
 tai-yü, length, marked play; next order following pao-yü,
 shih hsiang-yün, ying-ch'un, t'an ch'un, hsi ch'un, widow li wan, and
 rest, made choice plays, sung
 costumes necessary each. time came take their
 places banquet, dowager lady chia bade pao-ch'ai make another
 selection, pao-ch'ai cast choice upon play: "lu chih-shen,
 fit drunkenness stirs disturbance wu t'ai mountain;"
 whereupon pao-yü interposed, remark: "all fancy to
 choose plays kind;" pao-ch'ai rejoined, "you've
 listened plays years avail! know the
 beauties play? stage effect grand, still
 better apt elegant passages it."
 
"i've always dread sensational plays these!" pao-yü
 retorted.
 
"if call play sensational," pao-ch'ai smilingly expostulated,
 "well may fitly looked upon connoisseur of
 plays. come tell you. play constitutes one a
 set books, entitled 'pei tien peng ch'un,' which, far as
 harmony, musical rests closes, tune go, is, goes without
 saying, perfect; among elegant compositions ballad
 entitled: 'the parasitic plant,' written excellent style; but
 know anything it?"
 
pao-yü, upon hearing speak points beauty, hastily drew
 near her. "my dear cousin," entreated, "recite let hear
 it!" whereupon pao-ch'ai went follows:
 
manly tears will wipe away,
 place, scholar's home, stray.
 bonze mercy shall thank; lotus altar shave my
 pate;
 yüan luck lack; soon twinkle shall separate,
 needy forlorn come go, none care my
 fate.
 thither shall suppliant fog wrapper rain hat; my
 warrant shall roll,
 listless straw shoes broken bowl, wherever convert my
 fate may be, stroll.
 
soon pao-yü listened recital, full of
 enthusiasm, that, clapping knees hands, shaking his
 head, gave vent incessant praise; went extol
 pao-ch'ai, saying: "there's book know."
 
"be quiet, listen play," lin tai-yü urged; "they yet
 sung mountain gate, already pretend mad!"
 
words, hsiang-yün also laughed. but, due course, whole
 party watched performance evening, broke up. dowager
 lady chia much taken young actor, played the
 role lady, well one acted buffoon, she
 gave orders brought in; and, looked them
 closely, felt much interest them, went to
 inquire ages were. would-be lady (replied) that
 just eleven, would-be buffoon (explained) was
 just nine, whole company gave vent time expressions of
 sympathy lot; dowager lady chia bade servants bring a
 fresh supply meats fruits them, also gave them,
 besides wages, two tiaos present.
 
"this lad," lady feng observed smiling, "is dressed (as girl),
 living likeness certain person; notice just now?"
 
pao-ch'ai also aware fact, simply nodded head
 assentingly say was. pao-yü likewise expressed his
 assent shaking head, presume speak out.
 shih hsiang-yün, however, readily took conversation. "he
 resembles," interposed, "cousin lin's face!" remark
 reached pao-yü's ear, hastened cast angry scowl hsiang-yün,
 make sign; whole party, upon hearing had
 said, indulged careful minute scrutiny (the lad); as
 began laugh: "the resemblance indeed striking!" they
 exclaimed.
 
while, parted; evening came hsiang-yün directed
 ts'ui lü pack clothes.
 
"what's hurry?" ts'ui lü asked. "there will ample time pack
 up, day go!"
 
"we'll go to-morrow," hsiang-yün rejoined; "for use of
 remaining longer--to look people's mouths faces?"
 
pao-yü, words, lost time pressing forward.
 
"my dear cousin," urged; "you're wrong bearing grudge! my
 cousin lin girl touchy, though every one else
 distinctly knew (of resemblance), speak out; all
 afraid get angry; unexpectedly out
 came it, moment guard; ever couldn't
 feel hurt? dread give
 offence people winked you; now angry
 me; ungrateful me? one
 else, cared whether given offence even ten; that
 none business!"
 
hsiang-yün waved hand: "don't," added, "come tell these
 flowery words specious talk, really come your
 cousin lin. others poke fun her, impunity,
 say anything, incur blame. fact shouldn't
 spoken her, undeserving am; daughter a
 master, slave, mere servant girl, heaped insult upon
 her!"
 
"and yet," pleaded pao-yü, full perplexity, "i done your
 sake; this, come reproach. with
 evil heart so, may become ashes, trampled upon
 ten thousands people!"
 
"in felicitous firstmonth," hsiang-yün remonstrated, "you shouldn't
 talk much reckless nonsense! worthless despicable oaths,
 disjointed words, corrupt language, go tell benefit of
 mean sort people, everything take pleasure irritating
 others, keep thumb! mind drive to
 spit contemptuously you."
 
gave utterance words, betook inner
 room dowager lady chia's suite apartments, lay in
 high dudgeon, and, pao-yü heavy heart, help
 coming search tai-yü; strange say, soon put
 foot inside doorway, speedily hustled by
 tai-yü, shut door face.
 
pao-yü unable fathom motives, stood
 outside window, kept calling out: "my dear cousin," low
 tone voice; tai-yü paid slightest notice that
 pao-yü became melancholy drooped head, plunged in
 silence. though hsi jen had, early hour, come know the
 circumstances, well juncture tender any
 advice.
 
pao-yü remained standing vacant mood tai-yü imagined that
 gone back; came open door caught sight of
 pao-yü still waiting there; tai-yü feel justified to
 close door, pao-yü consequently followed in.
 
"every thing has," observed, "a wherefore; which, when
 spoken out, even give people pain; will rush rage,
 without rhyme! really owe rise?"
 
"it's well enough, all, ask me," tai-yü rejoined with
 indifferent smile, "but know why! to
 afford people amusement will compare actress, and
 make whole lot laugh me?"
 
"i never liken anything," pao-yü protested, "neither i
 ever laugh you! will get angry me?"
 
"was necessary done much made the
 comparison," tai-yü urged, "and need even laughter
 you? why, though mayn't likened anything, a
 laugh expense, were, yea dreadful did
 compare (to singing girl) ridiculed me!"
 
pao-yü find anything refute argument had
 just heard, tai-yü went say. "this offence can, anyhow, be
 condoned; but, more, also wink yün erh? was
 idea resolved mind? perhaps if
 played me, demeaning herself, making herself
 cheap? daughter duke marquis, forsooth the
 mean progeny poor plebeian family; that, diverted
 me, exposed depreciated,
 i, perchance, said anything retaliation? idea
 it? though purpose was, sure, honest enough, that
 girl wouldn't, however, receive favours you, got angry with
 just much did; though made also tool you
 good turn, she, contrary, asserts mean nature and
 take pleasure irritating people everything! were
 afraid lest hurt feelings, but, row with
 her, you? given offence,
 concern yours?"
 
pao-yü heard words, became alive fact that
 lent ear private conversation short
 back hsiang-yün: "all my, fears," carefully
 mused within himself, "lest two misunderstanding, i
 induced come them, act mediator; myself
 have, contrary hopes, incurred blame abuse sides! this
 just accords read day nan hua ching. 'the
 ingenious toil, wise full care; good-for-nothing seek for
 nothing, feed vegetables, roam list; wander
 purposeless like boat made fast!' 'the mountain trees,' text
 goes say, 'lead devastation; spring (conduces) to
 plunder; on." therefore indulged in
 reflection, depressed felt. "now few
 girls," proceeded ponder minutely, "and yet, unable treat
 way promote perfect harmony; will i
 forsooth (when will deal with)!"
 
reached point cogitations, (he decided) it
 really avail agree her, turning round, was
 making way alone apartments; lin tai-yü, upon
 noticing left side, readily concluded reflection
 marred spirits thoroughly lost temper as
 going without even giving vent single word, not
 restrain feeling inwardly irritated. "after
 gone time," hastily exclaimed, "don't come again, even
 whole lifetime; either much speak to
 me!"
 
pao-yü paid heed her, came back rooms, laying
 bed, kept muttering state chagrin; and
 though hsi jen knew full well reasons dejection, found it
 difficult summon courage say anything moment, and
 alternative try distract means of
 irrelevant matters. "the theatricals seen to-day," she
 consequently observed smiling, "will lead performances for
 several days, miss pao-ch'ai will, sure, give return feast."
 
"whether gives return feast not," pao-yü rejoined an
 apathetic smirk, "is concern mine!"
 
hsi jen perceived tone, unlike days, with
 words pronounced: "what's saying?" she
 therefore remarked gave another smile. "in pleasant and
 propitious first moon, ladies young ladies high
 glee, mood sort?"
 
"whether ladies cousins high spirits not," pao-yü
 replied forcing grin, "is also perfectly immaterial me."
 
"they all," hsi jen added, smilingly, "pleasant agreeable, and
 also little pleasant agreeable, conduce to
 enjoyment whole company?"
 
"what whole company, i?" pao-yü urged. "they all
 mutual friendships; i, poor fellow, forlorn, have
 none care rap me."
 
remarks reached clause, inadvertently tears
 trickled down; hsi jen realising state mind in, did
 venture say anything further. soon pao-yü reflected
 minutely sense import sentence, not
 refrain bursting forth loud fit crying, and, turning
 round, stood up, and, drawing near table, took the
 pencil, eagerly composed enigmatical lines:
 
thou wert test, thee test,
 hearts test, minds test,
 naught remains us test
 will yea well called test,
 naught put, say, test,
 will place set feet rest.
 
finished writing, gave way fears though he
 unfold meaning, others, came peruse these
 lines, able fathom them, also went on
 consequently indite another stanza, imitation "parasitic
 plant," inscribed close enigma; had
 read second time, felt heart free concern
 forthwith got bed, went sleep.
 
but, thought it, tai-yü, upon seeing pao-yü take his
 departure abrupt manner, designedly made use excuse
 bent upon finding hsi jen, come round see he
 to.
 
"he's gone sleep long ago!" hsi jen replied.
 
words, tai-yü felt inclined betake back once; but
 hsi jen smiled said: "please stop, miss. slip paper, and
 see it!" speedily taking pao-yü written a
 short back, handed tai-yü examine. tai-yü, on
 perusal, discovered pao-yü composed it, spur the
 moment, influence resentment; help
 thinking matter ridicule well regret; she
 hastily explained hsi jen: "this written fun, there's
 nothing consequence it!" concluded remark, she
 readily took along room, conned in
 company hsiang-yün; handing also next day pao-ch'ai to
 peruse. burden pao-ch'ai read was:
 
concern mine, thee paid heed,
 humour this, one please succeed!
 act thy wish may be! go, come whene'er thou list; 'tis naught to
 me.
 sorrow joy, without limit bound, indulge thou art free!
 hazy notion relatives distant close?
 purpose days racked heart woes?
 even time look back think, mind pleasure
 knows.
 
finished perusal, went glance the
 buddhistic stanza, smiling: "this being," soliloquised; "has
 awakened sense perception; fault, it's
 ballad mine yesterday incited this! subtle
 devices rationalistic books easy tendency to
 unsettle natural disposition, to-morrow actually get
 up, talk lot insane trash, fostered idea
 owe origin ballad mine; become the
 prime guilty people?"
 
saying this, promptly tore paper, and, delivering pieces to
 servant girls, bade go burn them.
 
"you torn it!" tai-yü remonstrated laughingly. "but wait
 ask it! come along you, vouch i'll
 make abandon idiotic frame mind depraved language."
 
three crossed over, point fact, pao-yü's room,
 tai-yü first smile observe. "pao-yü, may ask you
 something? valuable precious thing; most
 firm jade, value possess firmness innate
 you?"
 
pao-yü not, say anything way reply, two them
 remarked sneeringly: "with doltish bluntness will he
 absorb abstraction?" hsiang-yün also clapped
 hands laughed, "cousin pao discomfited."
 
"the latter part apothegm yours," tai-yü continued, "says:
 
"we find place feet rest.
 
"which certainly good; view, excellence yet
 complete! still tag two lines close;" she
 proceeded recite:
 
"if set place feet rest,
 peace freedom will best."
 
"there should, truth, adjunct make thoroughly
 explicit!" pao-ch'ai added. "in days yore, sixth founder the
 southern sect, hui neng, came, went first search his
 patron, shao chou district; upon hearing fifth
 founder, hung jen, huang mei, readily entered service in
 capacity buddhist cook; fifth founder, prompted a
 wish select buddhistic successor, bade neophytes the
 bonzes compose enigmatical stanza, one occupied the
 upper seat, shen hsiu, recited:
 
"a p'u t'i tree body is, heart like stand mirror
 bright,
 must needs, constant careful rubbing, left dust to
 alight!
 
"and hui neng, time cook-house pounding rice,
 overheard enigma. 'excellent, excellent,' ventured, 'but
 far completeness goes complete;' bethought
 apothegm: 'the p'u t'i, (an expression buddha or
 intelligence),' proceeded, 'is really tree; resplendent
 mirror, (buddhistic term heart), likewise stand; as, in
 fact, constitute tangible objects, be
 contaminated particles dust?' whereupon fifth founder once
 took robe clap-dish handed him. well, text now
 enigma presents identical idea, simple fact is
 lines full subtleties short back not, as
 yet, perfected brought issue, forsooth readily give
 task manner?"
 
"he able make reply," tai-yü rejoined sneeringly,
 "and must therefore held discomfited; even make
 suitable answer now, nothing common it!
 anyhow, time forth talk buddhistic spells,
 even two know able do, yet know and
 do; go concern abstraction?"
 
pao-yü had, mind, impression had
 attained perception, unawares sudden
 subjected question tai-yü, soon found beyond power
 give ready answer. pao-ch'ai furthermore came a
 religious disquisition, way illustration, subjects, in
 hitherto seen display ability, he
 communed within himself: "if knowledge, indeed in
 advance mine, haven't, yet, attained perception, what
 need now bring upon labour vexation?"
 
"who has, pray," hastily inquired smilingly, arriving the
 end reflections, "indulged buddhistic mysteries? did
 amounts nothing nonsensical trash, written, spur of
 moment, nothing else."
 
close remark four came terms
 old; suddenly servant announced empress (yüan
 ch'un) despatched messenger bring lantern-conundrum with
 directions go guess it, they
 found out, also devise one send in. at
 words, four left room hasty step, and
 adjourned dowager lady chia's drawing room, discovered a
 young eunuch, holding four-cornered, flat-topped lantern, white
 gauze, specially fabricated lantern riddles. the
 front side, already conundrum, whole company were
 vying looking making wild guesses; the
 young eunuch went transmit orders, saying: "young ladies, you
 speak guessing; one should
 secretly write solutions wrap up, take them
 together await majesty's personal inspection whether
 correct not."
 
upon listening words, pao-ch'ai drew near, perceived a
 glance, consisted stanza four lines, seven
 characters each; though novelty remarkable
 feature it, felt constrained outwardly give utterance to
 words praise. "it's hard guess!" simply added, she
 pretended plunged thought, fact soon she
 cast eye upon it, solved it. pao-yü, tai-yü,
 hsiang-yün, t'an-ch'un, four also hit upon answer, and
 secretly put writing; chia huan, chia lan the
 others time sent for, every one set work
 exert energies mind, and, arrived guess,
 noted paper; every individual member the
 family made choice object, composed riddle, was
 transcribed large round hand, affixed lantern. this
 done, eunuch took departure, evening drew near, came
 delivered commands imperial consort. "the conundrum,"
 said, "written highness, day, solved by
 every one, exception miss secunda master tertius, who
 made wrong guess. composed you, young ladies, likewise
 guessed; majesty know whether solutions

 written them, among solved,

 manner, took presents, conferred imperial consort, handed

ordinarily, one pao-yü say much talk any

 limited assents. rest, hsiang-yün had, though young
 girl, delicate physique, nevertheless ever fond of
 talking discussing; but, instance, chia cheng the
 feast, also held tongue restrained words. for
 tai-yü naturally peevish listless, much
 inclined indulge conversation; pao-ch'ai, never been
 reckless words frivolous deportment, likewise behaved
 present occasion usual dignified manner. hence that
 banquet, although family party, given sake relaxation,
 assumed contrariwise appearance restraint, old lady chia
 well aware ascribed presence of
 chia cheng alone, therefore, wine gone round three
 times, forthwith hurried chia cheng retire rest.
 
less cognisant chia cheng old lady's motives in
 packing afford favourable opportunity young
 ladies young men enjoy themselves, why, forcing a
 smile, observed: "having to-day heard venerable ladyship
 got large assortment excellent riddles, the
 occasion spring festival lanterns, consequently prepared
 prizes, well banquet, came express purpose of
 joining company; way confer fraction of
 fond love, cherish grandsons granddaughters,
 upon also, son?"
 
"when here," old lady chia replied smilingly, "they venture
 chat laugh; unless go, really fill intense
 dejection! feel inclined guess conundrums, well, tell
 one solve; guess right, mind, be
 mulcted!"
 
"of course submit penalty," chia cheng rejoined eagerly, as
 laughed, "but guess right, must like manner receive a
 reward!"
 
"this goes without saying!" dowager lady chia added; whereupon went
 recite:
 
monkey's body gently rests tree top!
 
"this refers," said, "to name fruit."
 
chia cheng already aware lichee, designedly
 made guesses random, fined several things; he
 subsequently gave, length, right answer, also obtained a
 present ladyship.
 
due course set forth conundrum old lady chia to
 guess:
 
correct body appearance,
 firm solid substance;
 words, true, give vent,
 spoken to, always assent.
 
done reciting it, communicated answer undertone
 pao-yü; pao-yü fathoming intention was, gently told
 grandmother chia, ladyship finding, reflection,
 really mistake it, readily remarked was
 inkslab.
 
"after all," chia cheng smiled; "your venerable ladyship can
 hit right answer one guess!" turning head round, "be
 quick," cried, "and bring prizes present them!" whereupon the
 married women waiting-maids assented one voice, they
 simultaneously handed large trays small boxes.
 
old lady chia passed things, one one, inspection; and
 finding consisted various kinds articles, novel and
 ingenious, use ornament, vogue lantern festival,
 heart deeply elated alacrity shouted, "pour a
 glass wine master!"
 
pao-yü took hold decanter, ying ch'un presented cup of
 wine.
 
"look screen!" continued dowager lady chia, "all riddles
 written young ladies; go guess my
 benefit!"
 
chia cheng signified obedience, rising walking the
 front screen, noticed first riddle, one composed
 imperial consort yüan, strain:
 
pluck devils repress influence abounds,
 like bound silk frame, like thunder breath resounds.
 one report rattles, men lo! fear dread;
 transformed ashes 'tis time see turn head.
 
"is cracker?" chia cheng inquired.
 
"it is," pao-yü assented.
 
chia cheng went peruse ying-ch'un's, referred
 article use:
 
exhaustless principle heavenly calculations human
 skill;
 skill may exist, without proper practice result find hard
 yet
 will be!
 whence cometh mixed confusion day still?
 simply figures yin yang agree.
 
"it's abacus," chia cheng observed.
 
"quite so!" replied ying ch'un smiling; also conned the
 one below, t'an-ch'un, ran thus something an
 object:
 
time 'neath stairs pages heads raise!
 term "pure brightness" meetest time thing make!
 vagrant silk snaps, slack, without tension strays!
 east wind begrudge farewell take!
 
"it seem," chia cheng suggested, "as must kite!"
 
"it is," answered t'an c'h'un; whereupon chia cheng read one below,
 written tai-yü effect bore upon thing:
 
audience, two sleeves brings fumes replete?

"isn't scented stick show watch?" chia cheng inquired.
 
"yes!" assented pao-yü, speaking tai-yü's behalf; chia cheng
 thereupon prosecuted perusal conundrum, ran follows,
 referred object;

"splendid! splendid!" exclaimed chia cheng, "my guess a
 looking-glass. excellently done!"
 
pao-yü smiled. "it looking glass!" rejoined.
 
"this is, however, anonymous; whose work it?" chia cheng went to
 ask, dowager lady chia interposed: "this, fancy, must been
 composed pao-yü," chia cheng said word, continued
 reading following conundrum, devised pao-ch'ai, on
 article other:
 
eyes though has; eyeballs none, empty 'tis inside!
 lotus flowers water peep, gladness meet,
 dryandra leaves begin drop, part divide,
 fond pair are, but, united, winter greet.
 
chia cheng finished scanning it, gave way reflection. "this
 object," pondered, "must surely limited use! persons of
 tender years indulge kind language, seem be
 still less propitious; cannot, views, the
 sort people enjoy happiness longevity!" reflections
 reached point, felt dejected, plainly betrayed a
 sad appearance, droop head plunge a
 brown study.
 
upon perceiving frame mind chia cheng was, dowager
 lady chia arrived conclusion must fatigued; and
 fearing, hand, detained him, whole party of
 young ladies lack spirit enjoy themselves, and
 faced chia cheng suggested: "there's need really to
 remain longer, better retire rest; let us

 cogitation, and, turned turned mind, he
 got still sad pained.
 
"amuse now!" readily exclaimed dowager lady chia, this
 while, seeing chia cheng off; remark barely finished,
 caught sight pao-yü run lantern screen, give
 vent, gesticulated hands kicked feet about, to
 criticisms first came lips. "in this," remarked,
 "this line happy; one, suitably solved!"
 behaved just like monkey, whose fetters let loose.
 
"were whole party all," hastily ventured tai-yü, "to sit down,
 short back chat laugh; more
 accordance good manners?"
 
lady feng thereupon egressed room inner end and
 interposed remarks. "such are," said, "shouldn't
 surely allowed mr. chia cheng, inch step side,
 right. just slipped memory, for
 i, father present, instigate bid you
 compose rhythmical enigma; would, doubt, been
 moment state perspiration!"
 
words, pao-yü lost patience, laying hold lady feng,
 hustled moments.
 
old lady chia went time bandy words li
 kung-ts'ai, whole company young ladies rest, that
 she, fact, felt considerably tired worn out; heard
 fourth watch already drawn nigh, consequently issued
 directions eatables cleared away given the
 crowd servants, suggested, readily rose feet, "let

 way turning money meet expenses with,--came, as
 luck it, hear work hand mansion,
 lost time driving curricle making appeal to
 lady feng. lady feng remembered along not
 presumed position put airs, willingly acceded her
 request, calling memory suitable remarks, once
 went make report madame wang: "these young bonzes taoist
 priests," said, "can means sent places; for

 every month will will depute one take
 taels buy firewood rice with, all, and
 even sound required uttered, one can
 go tell just one word 'come,' will come
 without least trouble!"
 
madame wang gave patient ear proposal, and, due course,
 consulted chia cheng.
 
"you've really," smiled chia cheng words, "reminded i
 act! yes, let done!" sent chia
 lien.
 
chia lien was, time, meal lady feng, soon
 heard wanted, put rice just walking

 young bonzes young taoists, must, particular matter,
 please comply suggestion mine," which, went in
 way way put whole lot hints.
 
"i know nothing it," chia lien rejoined smilingly, "and you
 knack better go tell him!"
 
soon lady feng heard remark, stiffened head and
 threw chopsticks; and, expression cheeks, which
 looked like smile yet smile, glanced angrily chia
 lien. "are speaking earnest," inquired, "or only
 jesting?"
 
"yün erh, fifth sister-in-law western porch, has
 come appealed two three times, asking something look
 after," chia lien laughed, "and assented bade wait; now,
 great deal trouble, job turned up; are
 snatching away!"
 
"compose mind," lady feng observed grinning, "for imperial
 consort hinted directions given planting, in
 north-east corner park, plentiful supply pine
 cedar trees, orders also issued addition,

"well really so," chia lien rejoined, "it will do!
 one thing; last night simply to
 fun you, obstinately perversely wouldn't."
 
lady feng, upon hearing words, burst laughing sound of
 ch'ih, spurting disdainfully chia lien, lowered head and
 went meal; time chia lien speedily
 walked away laughing while, betook front, where
 saw chia cheng. was, indeed, young bonzes, chia lien
 readily carried lady feng's suggestion. "as appearances,"
 continued, "ch'in erh has, actually, vastly improved, job

 never much attention give matters detail, he, as
 soon heard chia lien say, immediately signified his
 approval assent. chia lien, return quarters,
 communicated issue lady feng; whereupon lady feng sent
 one go notify dame chou.
 
chia ch'in came, due course, pay visit chia lien his
 wife, incessant expressions gratitude; lady feng
 bestowed upon favour giving him, first instalment,
 advance funds necessary three months' outlay, which
 bade write receipt; chia lien filled cheque and
 signed it; counter-order simultaneously issued, came
 treasury sum specified three months'
 supplies, amounting three hundred taels, paid pure ingots.
 
chia ch'in took first piece silver came hand, and
 gave men charge scales, told to
 cup tea, bidding, shortly after, boy-servant take the
 money home, held consultation mother; which, he
 hired donkey ride on, also bespoke several
 carriages, came back gate jung kuo mansion; where
 called twenty young priests, got carriages,
 sped straightway beyond city walls, temple iron
 fence, nothing note transpired time.
 
will now notice chia yüan-ch'un, within precincts the
 palace. arranged verses composed park broad
 vista order merit, suddenly recollected sights
 garden sure, ever since visit them, be
 diligently respectfully kept locked father mother; and
 allowing one go injustice done this
 garden? "besides," (she pondered), "in household, at
 present several young ladies, capable composing odes, able to
 write poetry, permission extended go
 take quarters it; order winsome persons
 might deprived good cheer, flowers willows
 may lack one admire them!"
 
remembering likewise pao-yü infancy grown among
 crowd female cousins, contrast rest his
 male cousins allowed move it, would, she
 also apprehended, made feel forlorn; dreading lest his
 grandmother mother displeased heart, thought it
 imperative permitted take quarters
 inside, things put satisfactory footing; and
 directing eunuch hsia chung go jung mansion deliver
 commands, expressed wish pao-ch'ai girls
 live garden kept closed, and
 urged pao-yü also shift it, pleasure, for
 prosecution studies. chia cheng madame wang, upon
 receiving commands, hastened, departure hsia chung, to
 explain dowager lady chia, despatch servants the
 garden tidy every place, dust, sweep, lay the
 portieres bed-curtains. tidings heard rest even with
 perfect equanimity, pao-yü immoderately delighted; was
 engaged deliberation dowager lady chia necessary and
 requirement, suddenly descried waiting-maid arrive,
 announced: "master wishes see pao-yü."
 
pao-yü gazed vacantly while. spirits simultaneously swept
 away; countenance changed colour; clinging old lady chia, he
 readily wriggled about, just one twist sugar (to make
 sweetmeats with), not, death him, summon up
 courage go; ladyship alternative try and
 reassure him. "my precious darling" urged, "just go, i'll
 stand you! venture hard upon you; besides, you've
 devised excellent literary compositions; presume her
 majesty desired move garden, object is
 give words advice; simply fears you
 might pranks grounds. tells you,
 whatever do, mind acquiesce will right!"
 
tried compose him, time called two old
 nurses enjoined take pao-yü due care, "and don't
 let father," added, "frighten him!"
 
old nurses expressed obedience, pao-yü felt constrained to
 walk ahead; one step scarcely progressing three inches, he
 leisurely came side. strange coincidence chia cheng in
 madame wang's apartments consulting upon matter other,
 chin ch'uan-erh, ts'ai yun, ts'ai feng, ts'ai luan, hsiu feng and
 whole number waiting-maids standing outside the
 verandah. soon caught sight pao-yü, puckered their
 mouths laughed him; chin ch'uan grasped pao-yü one
 hand, remarked low tone voice: "on lips mine has
 just rubbed cosmetic, soaked perfume, now inclined
 lick not?" whereupon ts'ai yün pushed chin ch'uan one
 shove, interposed laughingly, "a person's heart moment
 low spirits still go cracking jokes him? avail
 opportunity master good cheer make haste
 get in!"
 
pao-yü help sidle door walk in. chia cheng
 madame wang were, fact, inner rooms, dame chou
 raised portière. pao-yü stepped gingerly perceived chia cheng
 madame wang sitting opposite other, stove-couch,
 engaged conversation; row chairs sat ying ch'un,
 t'an ch'un, hsi ch'un chia huan; though four were
 seated t'an ch'un, hsi ch'un chia huan rose their
 feet, soon saw make appearance room; when
 chia cheng raised eyes noticed pao-yü standing front him,
 gait full ease winsome looks his, so
 captivating, realised mean chia huan was, and
 coarse deportment. suddenly also bethought of
 chia chu, reflected madame wang of
 flesh blood, upon ever doated upon gem, and
 beard already begun get hoary, consequence was
 unwittingly stifled, well nigh entirely, feeling hatred
 dislike, which, recent years ordinarily
 fostered towards pao-yü. long pause, "her majesty," he
 observed, "bade day day ramble outside disport
 yourself, result gradually became remiss lazy; but
 now desire keep strict control, that
 prosecuting studies company cousins the
 garden, carefully exert brains learn; you
 attend duties, mind regular tasks, had
 better guard!" pao-yü assented several consecutive yes's;
 whereupon madame wang drew side made sit down, and
 three cousins resumed seats previously occupied:
 "have finished pills taking short while
 back?" madame wang inquired, rubbed pao-yü's neck.
 
"there's still one pill remaining," pao-yü explained way reply.
 
"you better," madame wang added, "fetch ten pills tomorrow
 morning; every day bedtime tell hsi jen give you;
 one can go sleep!"
 
"ever since you, mother, bade take them," pao-yü rejoined, "hsi jen
 daily sent one, turn in."
 
"who's called hsi jen?" chia chen thereupon ascertained.
 
"she's waiting-maid!" madame wang answered.
 
"a servant girl," chia cheng remonstrated, "can called whatever
 name one chooses; anything good enough; started
 kind pretentious name!"
 
madame wang noticed chia cheng happy frame mind, so
 forthwith tried screen matters pao-yü, saying: "it's
 old lady originated it!"
 
"how can possibly be," chia cheng exclaimed, "that ladyship knows
 anything kind language? must, certainty, be
 pao-yü!"
 
pao-yü perceiving conceal truth him, was
 necessity standing explaining; "as all
 along read verses, remembered line written old poet:
 
"what time smell flowers wafts man, one knows the
 day warm.
 
"and waiting-maid's surname hua (flower), readily gave her
 name, strength sentiment."
 
"when get back," madame wang speedily suggested addressing pao-yü,
 "change done; you, sir, needn't lose temper over
 trivial matter!"
 
"it really matter least," chia cheng continued; "so that
 necessity changing it; evident pao-yü
 apply mind legitimate pursuits, mainly devotes his
 energies voluptuous expressions wanton verses!" he
 finished words, abruptly shouted out: "you brute-like child of
 retribution! yet get this?"
 
"get away, you!" madame wang like manner hastened urge;
 "our dowager lady waiting, fear, repast!"
 
pao-yü assented, and, gentle step, withdrew room,
 laughing chin ch'uan-erh, put tongue; leading off
 two nurses, went way like streak smoke. no
 sooner reached door corridor espied hsi jen
 standing leaning side; perceiving pao-yü come back safe
 sound heaped smile upon smile, asked: "what want you
 for?"
 
"there nothing much," pao-yü explained, "he simply feared i
 would, get garden, mischief, gave all
 sorts advice;" and, explained matters, came the
 presence lady chia, gave clear account, first last,
 transpired. saw lin tai-yü the
 moment room, pao-yü speedily inquired her: "which place you
 think best live in?"
 
tai-yü just cogitating subject, she
 unexpectedly heard pao-yü's inquiry, forthwith rejoined a
 smile: "my idea hsio hsiang kuan best; fond
 clusters bamboos, hide view tortuous
 balustrade make place secluded peaceful any
 other!"
 
pao-yü words clapped hands smiled. "that just meets
 views!" remarked; "i like go live in
 there; stay hung yuan, two will be, the
 first place, near other; next, quiet secluded
 spots."
 
two conversing, servant came, sent chia
 cheng, report dowager lady chia that: "the 22nd second moon
 propitious day pao-yü young ladies shift their
 quarters garden; days, servants be
 sent put things proper places clean; hsueh
 pao-ch'ai put heng wu court; lin tai-yü to

 pao-yü live hung court. every place two
 old nurses added four servant-girls; exclusive the
 nurse personal waiting-maid each, should, addition, be
 servants, whose special duties put things straight to
 sweep place; 22nd, all, body, move

season drew near, interior grounds, the
 flowers waving like embroidered sashes, willows fanned the
 fragrant breeze, desolate silent in
 previous days; without indulging irrelevant details,
 shall now go back pao-yü.
 
ever since shifted quarters park, heart full of
 joy, mind contentment, fostering none extraordinary
 ideas, whose tendency give birth longings hankerings.
 day day, simply indulged, company female cousins

putting aside pao-yü, leisurely occupied scanning some
 verses, will now allude ballads. lived, that
 time, class people, whose wont servilely court the
 influential wealthy, who, upon perceiving verses were
 composed young lad jung kuo mansion, twelve or
 thirteen years age, copies made, taking outside sang
 praise far wide. besides another sort of
 light-headed young men, whose heart set upon licentious and
 seductive lines, even inscribed fans screen-walls,
 time kept humming extolling them. the
 reasons must therefore ascribed fact persons came in
 search stanzas quest manuscripts, apply sketches and
 beg poetical compositions, increasing satisfaction of
 pao-yü, day day, home, devoted time attention
 extraneous matters. anticipated he
 ever quiet seclusion become prey spirit of
 restlessness? sudden, one day began feel discontent, finding
 fault turning nose that; going coming
 simply full ennui. girls garden were
 just prime youth, time life when, artless and
 unaffected, sat reclined without regard retirement, and
 disported joked without heed, ever have
 come read secrets time occupied place the
 heart pao-yü? unhappy pao-yü within soon
 felt loth stay garden, took gadding outside like
 evil spirit; behaved also idiotic manner.
 
ming yen, upon seeing go way, felt prompted, the
 idea affording mind distraction, think to
 devise expedient; everything indulged surfeit
 pao-yü, resource, (that suggested to
 him,) pao-yü yet experience. bringing his
 reflections close, forthwith came bookshop, and
 selecting novels, old present age, traditions
 intended outside circulation fei yen, ho te, wu tse-t'ien, and
 yang kuei-fei, well books light literature consisting of
 strange legends, purchased good number express
 purpose enticing pao-yü read them. soon pao-yü caught sight
 them, felt obtained gem jewel. "but you
 mustn't," ming yen went enjoin him, "take garden;
 one come know anything them, shall then
 suffer can bear; should, go along, hide
 clothes!"
 
pao-yü agree introducing garden? after
 much wavering, picked several volumes whose style
 refined, took in, threw top his
 bed peruse one present; coarse and
 indecent ones, concealed bundle outer library.
 
one day, happened middle decade third moon,
 pao-yü, breakfast, took book, "hui chen chi," hand
 walked far bridge hsin fang lock. seating himself
 block rock, lay peach trees quarter, he
 opened hui chen chi began read carefully the
 beginning. just came passage: "the falling red
 (flowers) formed heap," felt gust wind blow the
 trees, bringing whole bushel peach blossoms; and, they
 fell, whole person, entire surface book well a
 large extent ground simply bestrewn petals blossoms.
 pao-yü bent upon shaking down; feared lest they
 trodden foot, felt constrained carry petals in
 coat walk bank pond throw the
 stream. petals floated surface water, and, after
 whirling swaying there, length ran hsin
 fang lock. but, return tree, found ground again
 one mass petals, pao-yü just hesitating do, he
 heard one behind back inquire, "what here?" and
 soon pao-yü turned head round, discovered lin
 tai-yü, come carrying shoulder hoe raking
 flowers, hoe suspended gauze-bag, her
 hand held broom.
 
"that's right, well done!" pao-yü remarked smiling; "come sweep
 flowers, throw water yonder. just thrown a
 lot myself!"
 
"it right," lin tai-yü rejoined, "to throw water.
 water, see, clean enough here, soon finds
 way out, situated people's grounds, there
 it? misusing flowers just much if
 left here! corner, dug hole flowers,
 now sweep put gauze-bag bury them
 there; and, course many days, will also become converted
 earth, clean way (of disposing them)?"
 
pao-yü, listening words, felt inexpressibly delighted.
 "wait!" smiled, "until put book, help clear
 up!"
 
"what's book?" tai-yü inquired.
 
pao-yü question taken aback time to
 conceal it. "it's," replied hastily, "the chung yung ta
 hsüeh!"
 
"are going play fool me? quick give to
 see; will ever much better way!"
 
"cousin," pao-yü replied, "as far concerned don't
 mind you, seen it, please tell one else. it's
 really written beautiful style; begin reading
 it, even rice thought?"
 
spoke, handed her; tai-yü deposited flowers
 ground, took book, read first page;
 perused it, got much fascinated it,
 time finished reading sixteen whole chapters. but
 aroused state rapture diction, remained
 even fascination enough overpower senses; though
 finished reading, nevertheless continued state of

soon lady feng heard words, whole face beamed with

"there's reason it," chia yün observed, "which simply this.

chia yün upon hearing propitious language, hastily drew near one

soon chia yün entered court, stamped foot shouted,
 "the monkeys mischief! am, come;" the
 company servant-boys perceived him, one promptly

 chair, inquired, "has master secundus, mr. pao,
 come down?"
 
"he to-day," pei ming replied, "but you,
 mr. secundus, anything tell him, go see to

saying left room; chia yün meanwhile gave
 inspection pictures nicknacks. some
 considerable time elapsed, yet see arrive; and
 noticing besides lads gone romp, just
 plunged state despondency, heard outside door a
 voice cry out, winning tone, tender accents: "my elder
 brother!"
 
chia yün looked out, saw servant-maid fifteen or
 sixteen, indeed extremely winsome spruce. soon however as
 maid caught glimpse chia yün, speedily turned round
 withdrew sight. but, luck it, happened that
 pei ming coming along, seeing servant-maid front the
 door, observed: "welcome, welcome! quite loss get

 ran pursuit him, ascertained up; whereupon pei
 ming returned answer: "i waited whole day long, single
 soul came over; girl attached master secundus' (mr.
 pao's) rooms!" and, "my dear girl," consequently went say, "go
 take message. say mr. secundus, lives the
 portico, come!"
 
servant-maid, upon hearing words, knew a
 young gentleman belonging family served, did
 skulk sight, done first instance; with
 gaze sufficient kill, fixed two eyes upon chia yün, when
 heard chia yün interpose: "what portico the

"what's driving at?" pei ming shouted.
 
maid rejoined: "he's even siesta to-day, he'll

chia yün, upon finding concise yet well expressed this
 girl's remarks been, bent upon inquiring name was; but

chia yün turned head round, kept way, said way

"well, case, aunt," ventured chia yün smile, "you had
