chapter one
 
two worlds
 

will begin story event time ten or
 eleven years old went latin school little town. much
 old-time fragrance wafted back me, sensations
 unmixed, pass review memories--dark streets and
 bright houses towers, striking clocks features of
 men, comfortable homely rooms, rooms full secrecy dread of
 ghosts. sense atmosphere cosy warmth, rabbits and
 servant-girls, household remedies dried fruit. two worlds passed
 one other. two poles came forth day night.
 
one world home, even narrower that, it
 really comprised parents. world part
 well known me; meant mother father, love severity,
 good example school. world subdued lustre, clarity
 cleanliness; tender friendly words, washed hands, clean
 clothes good manners. morning hymn sung, christmas
 kept.
 
world straight lines paths led future;
 duty guilt, evil conscience confession, pardon and
 good resolutions, love adoration, bible texts wisdom. this
 world future belong, crystal-pure, beautiful
 well ordered.
 
world, however, began right midst own
 household, entirely different, another odor, another
 manner speech made different promises demands. this
 second world servant-girls workmen, ghost stories breath
 scandal. gaily colored flood monstrous, tempting,
 terrible, enigmatical goings-on, things slaughter house and
 prison, drunken men scolding women, cows birth-throes, plunging
 horses, tales burglaries, murders, suicides. beautiful and
 dreadful, wild cruel things round about, next street,
 next house. policemen tramps passed fro, drunken
 men beat wives, crowds young girls flowed factories

 robbers dwelt wood, incendiaries rounded mounted
 policemen--everywhere seethed reeked second, passionate world,
 everywhere, except rooms, mother father were. and

oddest thing was, closely two worlds bordered each

one half-holiday--i little ten time--i went

 thirteen years joined party; bigger were, coarse

 whole family bad reputation. knew frank kromer well, i
 afraid him, much displeased joined us. he
 already acquired manly ways, imitated gait manner of

 everything found description kept himself, well as

 father forbidden playing together known of

 like others. commanded obeyed; seemed habitual me,
 although first time him.
 
last sat down. frank spat water looked like full
 grown man; spat gap teeth, directing sputum in

 one another bragging schoolboy exploits pranks. was
 silent, yet, said nothing, afraid calling attention
 inciting kromer’s anger me. two comrades had
 beginning turned backs me, sided him;
 stranger among them, felt clothes manner be

 schoolboy gentleman, two, felt, as
 soon came point, disown leave lurch.
 
last, mere fright, also began relate story. i

hoped end gain little applause, warmed my
 work let go narration. two small boys waited
 quiet expectant, frank kromer looked penetratingly
 half-closed eyes asked threatening tone:
 
“is true?”
 
“yes,” said.
 
“really truly?”
 
“yes, really truly,” asserted defiantly, though inwardly was
 stifling fear.
 
“can swear it?”
 
terribly frightened, answered without hesitation: “yes.”
 
“then say: ‘i swear god that’s holy’!”
 
said: “i swear god that’s holy!”
 
“aw, gwan!” said turned away.
 
thought everything now right, glad got

 “we go way.” dawdled on, dared tear myself

“what’s matter?” asked. “what d’you want?”
 
“nothing much. want ask something--something others

“well, want tell you? must go upstairs, know.”
 
“you know, don’t you, whose orchard mill corner?”
 said frank softly.
 
“no, don’t know; think it’s miller’s.”
 
frank wound arm round me, drew quite close him, so
 look directly face. look boded ill, he
 smiled maliciously, face full cruelty power.
 
“now, kid, can tell whose garden is. known long

“good heavens!” exclaimed. “but won’t tell anything?” felt
 useless appeal sense honor. came other

“kromer,” said, “listen, mustn’t give away, wouldn’t be

smiled took watch big hand. looked hand and

“it’s silver,” said, timidly.
 
“i wouldn’t give straw silver old watch!” said
 deep scorn. “get repaired yourself!”
 
“but, frank,” exclaimed, quivering fear lest go away.
 “wait minute. take watch! it’s really silver, really and
 truly. haven’t got anything else.” gave cold scornful
 look.
 
“very well, then, know going to; can tell police.

kromer screwed evil mouth, spat ground.
 
“quit jawing,” said commandingly. “you can keep old trash

 money!”
 
“but haven’t any. never get money. can’t help it.”
 
“very well, then, you’ll bring two marks morning. shall

turned old street left alone, astonished i
 ever before. scarcely gone everything he
 said seemed quite unbelievable! cain noble fellow, abel a
 coward! cain’s sign distinction! absurd, blasphemous
 infamous. god’s part matter? accepted
 abel’s sacrifice, love abel? demian’s story nonsense!
 suspected making fun wishing mislead me. the
 devil clever fellow, talk, but--well----
 
still, never thought much biblical other
 stories before. time past never completely

 read story again, stands bible, short
 clear. quite foolish try find special, secret
 meaning. one, every murderer look upon a
 favorite god! no, nonsense. demian nice way of
 saying things, easily pleasantly, everything were
 self-evident--and eyes!
 
ideas certainly little upset, rather much
 confused. lived bright, clean world, a

 sign; imagined way shameful, distinction,
 wickedness unhappiness stood higher level my
 father, higher good pious people.
 
clear-thinking way experience then
 presented me, contained therein. only
 flaming feeling, strange emotions caused pain and
 yet filled pride.
 
considered matter, saw strangely demian spoken of
 fearless cowards! curiously explained mark
 cain’s forehead. singularly eyes lit up, peculiar
 eyes grown person! indistinctly shot brain: is
 himself, demian, sort cain? defend him, if
 feel like him? force gaze? he

thought led definite conclusion. stone fallen into
 well, well young soul. business cain,
 murder sign, long, long, time point
 seekings knowledge, doubts criticisms

noticed boys also occupied good deal with
 demian. told anyone version story cain,
 appeared interest others well. least, many rumors
 concerning “new boy” became current. still knew of
 them, help throw fresh light him, serve
 interpret him. remember first rumor demian’s
 mother rich. also said never went church,
 either. another rumor jews, they
 just easily been, secret, mohammedans. furthermore,
 tales told max demian’s strength. much certain, the
 strongest boy form, challenged fight, at

 several days unable use arm. whole evening rumor
 even ran dead. time everything asserted and
 believed, everything exciting wonderful. was
 satiety rumors while. little later new ones circulated,
 asserted demian intimate relations girls “knew
 everything.”
 
meanwhile affair frank kromer took inevitable course. i
 get away him, although left peace for
 days together, still bound him. dreams lived my
 shadow, thus fantasy credited actions not,
 reality, do; dreams absolutely slave. lived
 dreams--i always deep dreamer--more reality.
 shadowy conceptions wasted strength life force. often
 dreamed, among things, kromer ill-treated me, spat
 knelt and, worse, led commit
 grave crimes--or rather led, simply forced, his
 powerful influence. terrible dreams, i
 woke half mad, presented murderous attack father.

 time demian knelt upon me. and, quite new and
 profoundly impressive, everything suffered resistingly in
 torment hands kromer, suffered willingly demian, with
 feeling composed much joy fear. this

one rainy day ordered tormentor castle place, there

 usual.
 
“oh,” said, went away, “before forget--next time can
 bring sister along, elder one. what’s name? now tell the
 truth.”
 
understand, gave answer. looked him
 wonderingly.
 
“don’t get me? must bring sister along.”
 
“but kromer, won’t do. mustn’t that, besides wouldn’t
 come.”
 
thought another pretext vexing me. often did
 that, requiring something impossible, terrifying me.
 often, humiliating me, degrees become more
 tractable. buy money other

time quite different. really angry my
 refusal.
 
“well,” said airily, “you’ll think it, won’t you? should

gone, glimpse meaning request dawned me.
 still quite child, knew hearsay boys girls,
 somewhat older, things forbidden, things

 suddenly quite clear monstrous was! immediately
 resolved never that. scarcely dared think would
 happen case kromer revenge me. new
 torment began, yet tortured enough.
 
walked disconsolately across empty square, hands my
 pockets. fresh torments, new servitude!
 
suddenly fresh, deep voice called me. terrified began to
 run on. someone ran me, hand gripped behind. max
 demian.
 
let taken prisoner. surrendered.
 
“it’s you?” said uncertainly. “you frightened so!”
 
looked me, never glance like an
 adult, superior penetrating person. long time past we
 spoken one another.
 
“i sorry,” said courteous time very
 determined manner. “but listen, mustn’t let frightened
 like that.”
 
“oh, can happen sometimes.”
 
“so appears. look here: shrink like someone
 hasn’t hurt you, someone begins think. makes him
 curious, wonders can matter. somebody thinks to

 also people afraid. never be. no

“oh no, course not.”
 
“there, see. people afraid of?”
 
“i don’t know ... let go, want me?”
 
kept pace me--i going quicker idea escaping--i
 felt look directed side.
 
“just assume,” began again, “that mean well you. any
 case needn’t afraid me. much like try

looked helplessly face, serious prudent as
 always, kind well, without tenderness--his features were
 rather severe. righteousness something akin lay therein. not
 conscious happening; stood like magician me.
 
“have understood?” questioned again.
 
nodded. speak.
 
“i told mind-reading looked rather strange, process is
 quite natural. example tell less exactly what

“oh, no! don’t understand.”
 
“let’s keep old experiment! found that: boy s. is

demian gave powerful slap shoulder.
 
“that’s right then. thought so. now just one question more: you

sank back, key secret, secret twisted
 back inside want see light.
 
“what sort fellow? one there, except myself.”
 
laughed.
 
“don’t afraid tell me,” said laughingly. “what’s name?”
 
whispered: “do mean frank kromer?”
 
nodded contentedly.
 
“bravo! you’re smart chap, shall good friends yet. now i
 must tell something else: kromer, whatever name is, is
 nasty fellow. face tells he’s rascal! think?”
 
“oh yes,” sobbed out, “he nasty, he’s devil! mustn’t know
 anything! god’s sake, mustn’t know anything. d’you know him?
 know you?”
 
“don’t worry! he’s gone, doesn’t know me--not yet. should
 like make acquaintance. goes public school?”
 
“yes.”
 
“in standard?”
 
“in fifth. don’t say anything him! please, don’t say
 anything him!”
 
“don’t worry, nothing will happen you. suppose wouldn’t like
 tell little fellow kromer?”
 
“i can’t! no, let go!”
 
silent while.
 
“it’s pity,” said, “we might able carry the
 experiment still further. don’t want bother you. know,
 don’t you, right afraid him? fear
 quite undermines us, must get rid it. must get rid it, if
 want become real man. d’you understand?”
 
“certainly, quite right ... won’t do. don’t know....”
 
“you seen know lot, thought. owe him
 money?”
 
“yes, do, isn’t essential point. can’t tell, can’t!”
 
“it won’t help matters, then, give amount owe him? i
 well let it.”
 
“no, no, point. please: don’t say anything to
 anybody! word! making miserable!”
 
“rely me, sinclair. later can share secrets me.”
 
“never, never!” exclaimed vehemently.
 
“just please. mean, perhaps will tell something
 later on. free will, understand. surely you
 don’t think shall act like kromer?”
 
“oh no--but don’t even know anything it!”
 
“absolutely nothing. think it. shall never act like
 kromer, believe me. besides, don’t owe anything.”
 
remained long time silent, became tranquil. but
 demian’s knowledge became puzzle me.
 
“i’m going home now,” said, rain drew coat more
 closely him. “i like repeat one thing you,
 since gone far matter--you get rid this
 fellow! nothing else done, kill him! would
 impress please me, that. besides, help
 you.”
 
terrified. suddenly remembered story cain. had
 uncanny feeling began cry softly. much weird
 seemed surround me.
 
“all right,” max demian said, smilingly. “go home now! will put
 things square, although murder simplest. such
 matters simplest way always best. aren’t good hands,
 friend kromer.”
 
came home, seemed away year.
 everything looked different. kromer now stood
 something like future freedom, something like hope. lonely no
 longer! realized first time terribly lonely i
 weeks weeks. immediately recollected had
 several occasions turned mind: confession my
 parents afford relief yet quite liberate me. now
 almost confessed, another, stranger, strong
 perfume wafted me, sensed presentiment salvation!
 
still fear far overcome, still prepared for
 long terrible mental wrestlings evil genius. all
 remarkable everything passed secretly
 quietly.
 
kromer’s whistle remained absent house day, two days,
 three days, whole week. dared believe senses, lay
 inwardly watch, see whether suddenly stand
 me, just moment expect longer. but
 was, remained, away! distrustful new freedom, still
 bring believe whole-heartedly. at
 last met frank kromer. coming street, straight in
 direction. saw me, drew together, twisted his
 features brutal grimace, turned away without ado, in
 order avoid meeting me.
 
wonderful moment me! enemy ran away me! devil
 afraid me! surprise joy shook through!
 
days demian showed again. waited me
 outside school.
 
“hullo,” said.
 
“good morning, sinclair. wanted hear you’re getting on.
 kromer leaves peace, doesn’t he?”
 
“did manage that? it? how? don’t understand
 it. hasn’t come near me.”
 
“splendid. come again--i don’t think will, he’s a
 cheeky fellow--then simply tell remember demian.”
 
“but mean? fight thrashed
 him?”
 
“no, i’m keen that. simply talked him, you,
 made clear advantage leave you
 peace.”
 
“oh, haven’t given money?”
 
“no, kid. already tried way yourself.”
 
attempted pump matter, disengaged himself. the
 old, embarrassed feeling concerning came me--an odd mixture of
 gratitude shyness, admiration fear, affection inward
 resistance.
 
intention seeing soon, wanted talk
 everything, cain affair well. see
 him. gratitude one virtues believe, to
 require child seem wrong. wonder very
 much complete ingratitude evinced towards max demian.
 to-day believe positively ruined life if

said, ingratitude seems nothing strange. solely, the
 lack curiosity evinced odd. possible could
 continue single day quiet mode life without coming nearer
 secrets demian brought contact? could
 restrain desire hear cain, kromer, more

scarcely comprehensible, yet so. suddenly saw myself
 extricated demoniacal toils, saw world lying

 sought recover former happy, contented mental outlook, to

“no,” said, “that can’t done. say, one hasn’t free

dismayed. believed quite familiar the

 overthrow conceptions, stability believed it
 necessary maintain. no, one deal anything and
 everything like that, certainly holiest.
 
always, noticed opposition immediately, even had
 spoken word.
 
“i know,” said he, tone resignation, “it’s old story.
 everything right you’re serious it! i’ll tell
 something: one points one can clearly see

contrary custom, become almost vehement, smiled
 immediately pressed further.
 
words encountered riddle whole boyhood,
 hourly carried me, never spoken

 official godly world suppressed devil’s world, exactly
 idea, myth, idea two worlds two halves of

told friend--the first time life revealed deep a
 secret--of conception “two worlds,” conception had
 formed since earliest years childhood. saw
 thorough agreement him. kind to
 make this. listened greater attention had
 ever given me, looked eyes turn away. i
 noticed look odd, animal-like timelessness, this
 inconceivably old age.
 
“we will talk another time,” said considerately: “i
 see think can express. so, then
 also know never lived experience have

impressed deeply.
 
“but,” almost shouted, “there _are_ horrible things are
 really actually forbidden--you can’t deny fact. are
 forbidden all, must renounce them. know course

 shall then, simply things exist, go become a
 criminal?”
 
“we shan’t able finish discussion to-day,” said max, a
 milder tone. “you must certainly commit murder rape, no. you

suddenly seemed regret said much, broke off. felt
 understand certain extent sentiment was. that
 say, however agreeably used present ideas (apparently
 cursory manner) account tolerate conversation
 made simply “for sake talking,” said. realized
 case that, although interest genuine enough, too
 much inclined look upon discussion game, fond clever

 explained us solemn admission community

 riveted attention. terrified, read on, heart seemed to
 become numb sense destiny.
 
“the bird fights way egg. egg world. whoever
 will born must destroy world. bird flies god. name of

sank deep meditation read words several
 times. admitted doubt: demian’s answer. none could

 understood helped explain significance. was

 abraxas mean? never read heard word. “the name the

heard voice again. loudly word “abraxas” fell his

continuing explanation, beginning escaped me,
 doctor follen said: “we must imagine ideas sects and

certain dream, play fantasy, recurred me, full of
 significance. dream, important enduring of
 life, follows: returned home--over front door shone

gradually unconsciously realized connection

many evening thereafter sat church, walked and

 happy inside, organist played organ loft by
 dim gas light. music played heard he

 like pilgrims beggars middle ages, pious reckless

 italian music. pieces said thing, expressed
 musician soul: longing, longing identify

“why, always lock door!”
 
“just lately forgot, sat inside. otherwise stand outside or

“is so? another time can come inside, it’s warmer. you’ve

organist pushed back broad hat shook dark hair from

 towards table.
 
softly tensely questioned:
 
“what’s name god talking?”
 
“unfortunately know practically nothing really, his
 name. name’s abraxas.”
 
musician looked distrustfully around, someone might be
 eavesdropping. bent towards said whisper: “i
 thought so. you?”
 
“i’m student school.”
 
“how know abraxas?”
 
“by chance.”
 
thumped table, wine spilled over.
 
“chance! don’t talk nonsense, young man! one doesn’t know abraxas

“shall another drink?” asked.
 
“thanks, no. don’t care much drinking.”

“as wish! different. staying here. can go now!”
 
next time saw organ recital, very
 communicative. conducted old street old, stately

 besides piano, nothing indicate occupant a

“what lot books have!” said appreciatively.

without realized it, organist pistorius given a
 first lesson, lay floor front fireplace his

 curiously beneficial enriching--dreaming staring fire!

 subject.
 
“we confine personality within much narrow bounds. count as

“well good,” objected; “but worth the

“stop!” exclaimed pistorius vehemently. “there great difference

saw max demian, sitting stool curtained window. his
 attitude cramped oddly changed. thought flashed
 me: seen like before! arms were
 motionless side, hands lap; face inclined
 slightly forward, open eyes, without sight, dead. the
 eyes glimmered dully little reflex light, piece of
 glass. pale face self-absorbed without expression, save
 great rigidity. looked like ancient mask animal

recollection came me--thus, exactly thus, seen
 him, many years ago, still quite boy. thus eyes
 stared inwards, thus hands lying motionless, close one

 opened front door me.
 
took room. gas flame burned the
 laboratory, paper lay about, appeared working.
 
“sit down,” invited, “you must tired, terrible storm;

chapter one
 
two worlds
 

will begin story event time ten or
 eleven years old went latin school little town. much
 old-time fragrance wafted back me, sensations
 unmixed, pass review memories--dark streets and
 bright houses towers, striking clocks features of
 men, comfortable homely rooms, rooms full secrecy dread of
 ghosts. sense atmosphere cosy warmth, rabbits and
 servant-girls, household remedies dried fruit. two worlds passed
 one other. two poles came forth day night.
 
one world home, even narrower that, it
 really comprised parents. world part
 well known me; meant mother father, love severity,
 good example school. world subdued lustre, clarity
 cleanliness; tender friendly words, washed hands, clean
 clothes good manners. morning hymn sung, christmas
 kept.
 
world straight lines paths led future;
 duty guilt, evil conscience confession, pardon and
 good resolutions, love adoration, bible texts wisdom. this
 world future belong, crystal-pure, beautiful
 well ordered.
 
world, however, began right midst own
 household, entirely different, another odor, another
 manner speech made different promises demands. this
 second world servant-girls workmen, ghost stories breath
 scandal. gaily colored flood monstrous, tempting,
 terrible, enigmatical goings-on, things slaughter house and
 prison, drunken men scolding women, cows birth-throes, plunging
 horses, tales burglaries, murders, suicides. beautiful and
 dreadful, wild cruel things round about, next street,
 next house. policemen tramps passed fro, drunken
 men beat wives, crowds young girls flowed factories
 evening, old women able bewitch make ill,
 robbers dwelt wood, incendiaries rounded mounted
 policemen--everywhere seethed reeked second, passionate world,
 everywhere, except rooms, mother father were. and
 good thing. wonderful house there
 peace, order repose, duty good conscience, pardon and
 love--and wonderful also things, all
 loud shrill, sinister violent, yet one
 escape one bound mother.
 
oddest thing was, closely two worlds bordered each
 other, near were! instance, servant lina, as
 sat sitting-room door evening prayers, sang the
 hymn bright voice, freshly washed hands laid her
 smoothed-out apron, belonged absolutely father mother, us,
 bright proper. immediately after, kitchen in
 woodshed, telling tale headless dwarf,
 quarreled women neighborhood little
 butcher’s shop, another person, belonged other
 world, enveloped mystery. everything
 everyone, especially myself. sure, belonged the
 bright, respectable world, parents’ child, other
 world present everything saw heard, also lived in
 it, although often strange foreign me, although one had
 regularly bad conscience anxiety. sometimes even liked
 live forbidden world best, often homecoming the
 brightness--however necessary good might be--seemed almost like
 return something less beautiful, something uninteresting
 desolate. times realized this: aim life grow
 like father mother, bright pure, systematic and
 superior. road attainment long, go school
 study pass tests examinations. road led past other
 dark world it, improbable would
 remain buried it. stories prodigal sons
 happened--i passionately fond reading them.
 return home father respectable world always
 liberating sublime, quite felt alone right
 good desirable. still part stories dealt
 wicked profligate far alluring, one
 allowed acknowledge openly, really often great
 pity prodigal repented redeemed. one say
 that, one actually think it. present somehow or
 presentiment possibility, deep one’s feelings.
 pictured devil myself, quite well imagine him

sisters also belonged bright world. often seemed me

 better nicer mannered myself, without many faults. had
 failings, naughty, seem be
 deep-rooted. me, contact with
 evil strong painful, dark world much nearer. my
 sisters, like parents, treated regard respect.

 afterwards wrongdoer cause squabble, the
 one beg pardon. opposing sisters offended my
 parents, representatives goodness law. secrets

one half-holiday--i little ten time--i went
 two boys neighborhood. public-school boy about
 thirteen years joined party; bigger were, coarse
 robust fellow, tailor. father drunkard, and
 whole family bad reputation. knew frank kromer well, i
 afraid him, much displeased joined us. he
 already acquired manly ways, imitated gait manner of

 everything found description kept himself, well as

 father forbidden playing together known of

 like others. commanded obeyed; seemed habitual me,
 although first time him.
 
last sat down. frank spat water looked like full
 grown man; spat gap teeth, directing sputum in
 direction wished. began conversation, boys vied
 one another bragging schoolboy exploits pranks. was
 silent, yet, said nothing, afraid calling attention
 inciting kromer’s anger me. two comrades had
 beginning turned backs me, sided him;
 stranger among them, felt clothes manner be
 provocation. impossible frank like me, latin
 schoolboy gentleman, two, felt, as
 soon came point, disown leave lurch.
 
last, mere fright, also began relate story. i

hoped end gain little applause, warmed my
 work let go narration. two small boys waited
 quiet expectant, frank kromer looked penetratingly
 half-closed eyes asked threatening tone:
 
“is true?”
 
“yes,” said.
 
“really truly?”
 
“yes, really truly,” asserted defiantly, though inwardly was
 stifling fear.
 
“can swear it?”
 
terribly frightened, answered without hesitation: “yes.”
 
“then say: ‘i swear god that’s holy’!”
 
said: “i swear god that’s holy!”
 
“aw, gwan!” said turned away.
 
thought everything now right, glad got

 must now go home. “don’t hurry,” laughed frank,
 “we go way.” dawdled on, dared tear myself

 arrived, looked heavy brass-knocker, sun window and

“what’s matter?” asked. “what d’you want?”
 
“nothing much. want ask something--something others

“well, want tell you? must go upstairs, know.”
 
“you know, don’t you, whose orchard mill corner?”
 said frank softly.
 
“no, don’t know; think it’s miller’s.”
 
frank wound arm round me, drew quite close him, so
 look directly face. look boded ill, he
 smiled maliciously, face full cruelty power.
 
“now, kid, can tell whose garden is. known long

“good heavens!” exclaimed. “but won’t tell anything?” felt
 useless appeal sense honor. came other

“say nothing?” laughed kromer. “look here, friend, d’you think am

“kromer,” said, “listen, mustn’t give away, wouldn’t be

 good, one little thing wrong, that’s all, needs repairing.”
 
smiled took watch big hand. looked hand and
 felt coarse hostile was, grasped life peace.
 
“it’s silver,” said, timidly.
 
“i wouldn’t give straw silver old watch!” said
 deep scorn. “get repaired yourself!”
 
“but, frank,” exclaimed, quivering fear lest go away.
 “wait minute. take watch! it’s really silver, really and
 truly. haven’t got anything else.” gave cold scornful
 look.
 
“very well, then, know going to; can tell police.

“frank,” implored, hoarse emotion, “please don’t anything

“oh, yes, joke, might cost dear.”
 
“do tell me, frank, do. i’ll anything!” examined me
 critically screwed-up eyes laughed again.
 
“don’t silly,” said affected affability. “you know well
 do. i’ve got chance earning couple marks, i’m not
 rich fellow can afford throw away, know that

 give just two marks everything will right.”

“i nothing,” said sadly. “i money all. i’ll give

 soldiers, compass. i’ll get you.”
 
kromer screwed evil mouth, spat ground.
 
“quit jawing,” said commandingly. “you can keep old trash
 yourself. compass! don’t make angry, d’you hear? hand the
 money!”
 
“but haven’t any. never get money. can’t help it.”
 
“very well, then, you’ll bring two marks morning. shall

“yes; shall get it, then? good lord! haven’t any----”
 
“there’s enough money house. that’s business. to-morrow

turned old street left alone, astonished i
 ever before. scarcely gone everything he
 said seemed quite unbelievable! cain noble fellow, abel a
 coward! cain’s sign distinction! absurd, blasphemous
 infamous. god’s part matter? accepted
 abel’s sacrifice, love abel? demian’s story nonsense!
 suspected making fun wishing mislead me. the
 devil clever fellow, talk, but--well----
 
still, never thought much biblical other
 stories before. time past never completely
 forgotten frank kromer, hours, whole evening. home i
 read story again, stands bible, short
 clear. quite foolish try find special, secret
 meaning. one, every murderer look upon a
 favorite god! no, nonsense. demian nice way of
 saying things, easily pleasantly, everything were
 self-evident--and eyes!
 
ideas certainly little upset, rather much
 confused. lived bright, clean world, a
 sort abel, now firmly fixed had
 sunk deeply, really help it? my
 position now? reminiscence glowed moment almost
 took away breath. remembered wretched evening, my
 present misery dated, looked instant heart my
 father’s bright world despised wisdom! cain bore
 sign; imagined way shameful, distinction,
 wickedness unhappiness stood higher level my
 father, higher good pious people.
 
clear-thinking way experience then
 presented me, contained therein. only
 flaming feeling, strange emotions caused pain and
 yet filled pride.
 
considered matter, saw strangely demian spoken of
 fearless cowards! curiously explained mark
 cain’s forehead. singularly eyes lit up, peculiar
 eyes grown person! indistinctly shot brain: is
 himself, demian, sort cain? defend him, if
 feel like him? force gaze? he
 speak scornfully “others,” fearsome, really
 pious well-considered god?
 
thought led definite conclusion. stone fallen into
 well, well young soul. business cain,
 murder sign, long, long, time point
 seekings knowledge, doubts criticisms
 took departure.
 
noticed boys also occupied good deal with
 demian. told anyone version story cain,
 appeared interest others well. least, many rumors
 concerning “new boy” became current. still knew of
 them, help throw fresh light him, serve
 interpret him. remember first rumor demian’s
 mother rich. also said never went church,
 either. another rumor jews, they
 just easily been, secret, mohammedans. furthermore,
 tales told max demian’s strength. much certain, the
 strongest boy form, challenged fight, at
 refusal branded coward, suffered terrible humiliation his

 several days unable use arm. whole evening rumor
 even ran dead. time everything asserted and
 believed, everything exciting wonderful. was
 satiety rumors while. little later new ones circulated,
 asserted demian intimate relations girls “knew
 everything.”
 
meanwhile affair frank kromer took inevitable course. i
 get away him, although left peace for
 days together, still bound him. dreams lived my
 shadow, thus fantasy credited actions not,
 reality, do; dreams absolutely slave. lived
 dreams--i always deep dreamer--more reality.
 shadowy conceptions wasted strength life force. often
 dreamed, among things, kromer ill-treated me, spat
 knelt and, worse, led commit
 grave crimes--or rather led, simply forced, his
 powerful influence. terrible dreams, i

 profoundly impressive, everything suffered resistingly in
 torment hands kromer, suffered willingly demian, with

“oh,” said, went away, “before forget--next time can

“don’t get me? must bring sister along.”
 
“but kromer, won’t do. mustn’t that, besides wouldn’t

suddenly fresh, deep voice called me. terrified began to
 run on. someone ran me, hand gripped behind. max

“it’s you?” said uncertainly. “you frightened so!”
 
looked me, never glance like an

“i sorry,” said courteous time very

“oh, can happen sometimes.”
 
“so appears. look here: shrink like someone

“just assume,” began again, “that mean well you. any

“have understood?” questioned again.
 
nodded. speak.
 
“i told mind-reading looked rather strange, process is

sank back, key secret, secret twisted

“what sort fellow? one there, except myself.”
 
laughed.
 
“don’t afraid tell me,” said laughingly. “what’s name?”
 
whispered: “do mean frank kromer?”
 
nodded contentedly.
 
“bravo! you’re smart chap, shall good friends yet. now i
 must tell something else: kromer, whatever name is, is
 nasty fellow. face tells he’s rascal! think?”
 
“oh yes,” sobbed out, “he nasty, he’s devil! mustn’t know

“don’t worry! he’s gone, doesn’t know me--not yet. should

“yes.”

“in fifth. don’t say anything him! please, don’t say

“don’t worry, nothing will happen you. suppose wouldn’t like

“i can’t! no, let go!”

“it’s pity,” said, “we might able carry the

“certainly, quite right ... won’t do. don’t know....”
 
“you seen know lot, thought. owe him

“yes, do, isn’t essential point. can’t tell, can’t!”
 
“it won’t help matters, then, give amount owe him? i

“no, no, point. please: don’t say anything to

“rely me, sinclair. later can share secrets me.”
 
“never, never!” exclaimed vehemently.
 
“just please. mean, perhaps will tell something

 don’t think shall act like kromer?”
 
“oh no--but don’t even know anything it!”
 
“absolutely nothing. think it. shall never act like
 kromer, believe me. besides, don’t owe anything.”
 
remained long time silent, became tranquil. but
 demian’s knowledge became puzzle me.
 
“i’m going home now,” said, rain drew coat more
 closely him. “i like repeat one thing you,
 since gone far matter--you get rid this
 fellow! nothing else done, kill him! would
 impress please me, that. besides, help
 you.”
 
terrified. suddenly remembered story cain. had
 uncanny feeling began cry softly. much weird
 seemed surround me.
 
“all right,” max demian said, smilingly. “go home now! will put
 things square, although murder simplest. such
 matters simplest way always best. aren’t good hands,
 friend kromer.”
 
came home, seemed away year.
 everything looked different. kromer now stood
 something like future freedom, something like hope. lonely no
 longer! realized first time terribly lonely i
 weeks weeks. immediately recollected had
 several occasions turned mind: confession my
 parents afford relief yet quite liberate me. now
 almost confessed, another, stranger, strong
 perfume wafted me, sensed presentiment salvation!
 
still fear far overcome, still prepared for
 long terrible mental wrestlings evil genius. all
 remarkable everything passed secretly
 quietly.
 
kromer’s whistle remained absent house day, two days,
 three days, whole week. dared believe senses, lay
 inwardly watch, see whether suddenly stand
 me, just moment expect longer. but
 was, remained, away! distrustful new freedom, still
 bring believe whole-heartedly. at
 last met frank kromer. coming street, straight in
 direction. saw me, drew together, twisted his
 features brutal grimace, turned away without ado, in
 order avoid meeting me.
 
wonderful moment me! enemy ran away me! devil
 afraid me! surprise joy shook through!
 
days demian showed again. waited me
 outside school.
 
“hullo,” said.
 
“good morning, sinclair. wanted hear you’re getting on.
 kromer leaves peace, doesn’t he?”
 
“did manage that? it? how? don’t understand
 it. hasn’t come near me.”
 
“splendid. come again--i don’t think will, he’s a
 cheeky fellow--then simply tell remember demian.”
 
“but mean? fight thrashed
 him?”
 
“no, i’m keen that. simply talked him, you,
 made clear advantage leave you
 peace.”
 
“oh, haven’t given money?”
 
“no, kid. already tried way yourself.”
 
attempted pump matter, disengaged himself. the
 old, embarrassed feeling concerning came me--an odd mixture of
 gratitude shyness, admiration fear, affection inward
 resistance.
 
intention seeing soon, wanted talk
 everything, cain affair well. see
 him. gratitude one virtues believe, to
 require child seem wrong. wonder very
 much complete ingratitude evinced towards max demian.
 to-day believe positively ruined life if

said, ingratitude seems nothing strange. solely, the
 lack curiosity evinced odd. possible could
 continue single day quiet mode life without coming nearer
 secrets demian brought contact? could
 restrain desire hear cain, kromer, more
 thought-reading?
 
scarcely comprehensible, yet so. suddenly saw myself
 extricated demoniacal toils, saw world lying
 bright cheerful me. longer subject paroxysms

 condemned creature, schoolboy again. temperament sought

 sought recover former happy, contented mental outlook, to

“can really make another person think want to?” i
 asked him.
 
gave information subject readily enough, quietly and
 pertinently, grown-up manner.
 
“no,” said, “that can’t done. say, one hasn’t free

 can observe someone well, can say fairly exactly he

 impregnates female, lays egg. suppose your

 desires seemed sufficiently pressing. nothing came of
 it. bring talk matters demian. should
 able make understand wanted. not

faith matters religion meanwhile suffered many breach.
 yet manner thinking, entirely influence of

 professed entire disbelief. let occasional
 phrases overheard, effect laughable unworthy

 listened passion according st. matthew bach, felt the
 mystical thrills dark, powerful, mysterious world passion
 suffering. find music, even to-day “actus

conclusion lesson demian said contemplatively:
 
“there’s something this, sinclair, don’t like. read through
 story, consider it, there’s something sounds insipid. i
 mean business two thieves. it’s sublime, three crosses
 standing side side hill! sentimental

 descendant cain. don’t think so?”
 
dismayed. believed quite familiar the
 story crucifixion, now saw first time what
 little personal judgment brought bear it, little
 force imagination fantasy listened read
 it. demian’s new ideas, therefore, quite annoying, threatening
 overthrow conceptions, stability believed it
 necessary maintain. no, one deal anything and
 everything like that, certainly holiest.
 
always, noticed opposition immediately, even had
 spoken word.
 
“i know,” said he, tone resignation, “it’s old story.
 everything right you’re serious it! i’ll tell
 something: one points one can clearly see
 shortcomings religion. fact god, the
 old new dispensation, may excellent conception, but
 really be. everything good,

 worship devil well god. find quite right.
 create god, embody devil well, and
 close eyes, natural

contrary custom, become almost vehement, smiled
 immediately pressed further.
 
words encountered riddle whole boyhood,
 hourly carried me, never spoken
 anyone. demian said god devil, the
 official godly world suppressed devil’s world, exactly
 idea, myth, idea two worlds two halves of
 world--the light dark. realization problem
 problem humanity whole, life thought general,
 suddenly dawned me, recognition inspired fear and
 awe suddenly felt extent innermost personal
 life thought part eternal stream great ideas. the
 realization joyful, although confirmed mode thought
 made happy certain extent. hard tasted raw,
 hint responsibility lay therein, telling put away
 childish things stand alone.
 
told friend--the first time life revealed deep a
 secret--of conception “two worlds,” conception had
 formed since earliest years childhood. saw
 thorough agreement him. kind to
 make this. listened greater attention had
 ever given me, looked eyes turn away. i
 noticed look odd, animal-like timelessness, this
 inconceivably old age.
 
“we will talk another time,” said considerately: “i
 see think can express. so, then
 also know never lived experience have
 thought, good. thought live in
 experience value. knew ‘world sanction’ was
 simply one-half world, yet tried suppress other
 half you, parsons teachers. will succeed. no
 one succeeds began think.”
 
impressed deeply.
 
“but,” almost shouted, “there _are_ horrible things are
 really actually forbidden--you can’t deny fact. are
 forbidden all, must renounce them. know course
 things murder, possible kinds vice,
 shall then, simply things exist, go become a
 criminal?”
 
“we shan’t able finish discussion to-day,” said max, a
 milder tone. “you must certainly commit murder rape, no. you
 haven’t yet reached point one can see ‘permitted’
 really ‘taboo.’ realized part truth.
 remainder will come after, rely it. instance, past

 happen be. easy time it. others realize carry laws
 themselves. things forbidden every man honor

 otherwise taboo. everyone must stand himself.”
 
suddenly seemed regret said much, broke off. felt
 understand certain extent sentiment was. that
 say, however agreeably used present ideas (apparently
 cursory manner) account tolerate conversation
 made simply “for sake talking,” said. realized
 case that, although interest genuine enough, too
 much inclined look upon discussion game, fond clever
 talking--in short lacking perfect seriousness.
 
* * * * *
 
read words just written--“perfect
 seriousness”--another scene suddenly comes mind, most
 impressive experience lived max demian still
 half-childlike times.
 
confirmation classes drawing end, closing
 lessons devoted last supper. clergyman thought this
 important, took pains make us feel something the
 inspiration sacred character teaching. however, precisely
 last lessons, thoughts diverted another object,
 person friend. looking forward confirmation, which
 explained us solemn admission community
 church, thought presented imperatively that
 value half-year’s religious instruction lie for

 influence. church ready received,
 something else, order ideas personalities

days happened another discussion him; it

 little pleasure talk, perhaps rather precocious and
 bombastic.
 
“we talk much,” said unwonted gravity. “wise speeches have

entered schoolroom immediately after. lesson began. took
 pains listen, demian disturb effort. a

“now quite retired himself,” felt shudder. never

scarcely understood one besides noticed it. thought

 perfectly motionless. waited see long maintain this

 tired, suffered violent twitching eyelids.
 
confirmation took place soon after, important
 recollections remain me.
 
everything now quite changed. childhood fell ruins. my
 parents used look certain embarrassment. sisters had
 become quite strange conduct towards me. disillusionment
 falsified weakened old sentiments pleasures, garden was
 without fragrance, wood longer inviting, world around
 seemed like clearance-sale old articles, insipid without
 charm, books merely paper, music noise. leaves fall thus

“the bird fights way egg. egg world. whoever

heard voice again. loudly word “abraxas” fell his

continuing explanation, beginning escaped me,
 doctor follen said: “we must imagine ideas sects and

“to unite divine diabolical,” rang ears. a

certain dream, play fantasy, recurred me, full of
 significance. dream, important enduring of
 life, follows: returned home--over front door shone
 crest yellow bird blue ground--my mother came to
 meet me--but entered wished embrace her, she,

gradually unconsciously realized connection

couple weeks later matriculated university h----.
 everything disappointed me. course lectures followed, the
 history philosophy, just vain mechanical common

 forced gaiety, looked distressingly vacant. like the

late one evening wandered town; autumn wind was
 blowing heard student societies singing taverns.
 tobacco smoke rose clouds open windows; songs being
 roared out, loudly tensely; noise soar up, fell
 dully ear, lifelessly uniform.
 
stood street corner listened. two cafés flood of
 song rolled forth night. everywhere community, everywhere
 huddling together, everywhere unloading burden of
 destiny, flight warm proximity herd!
 
two men passed slowly. caught phrase conversation.
 
“isn’t just like assembly youths nigger village?” said
 one. “they things. even tattooing fashion. look,

“well, don’t suppose it’s better japan. people do
 follow herd everywhere rare. here, too.”
 
every word went me. felt pleasure dread. recognized the
 speaker. demian.
 
windy night followed japanese dark
 streets, listening conversation enjoying ring of
 demian’s voice. old tone, old, beautiful sureness and
 tranquillity, power me. now everything was
 right. found him.
 
end street suburbs japanese took leave and
 closed house door behind him. demian took way back. had
 remained standing, awaited middle street. with
 beating heart saw approaching erect walking elastic

“demian!” called.

“so it’s you, then, sinclair? expected you.”
 
“did know here?”
 
“i know certain, hoped might true. saw you

“you recognized once?”

“i know. rather did. painted picture you,

“your mother? here? doesn’t know bit.”
 
“oh, knows you. will know, without even asking her, who

“oh, often wanted write, nothing came it. time

pushed arm mine went on. tranquillity seemed to
 emanate pass me. soon chatting together as
 formerly. mentioned schooldays, confirmation class that
 unlucky meeting holidays--only mention made of
 earliest closest bond us, affair frank

unexpectedly found middle singular ominous
 conversation. recalled demian’s discourse japanese,
 spoke student life general branched
 something else, seemed rather way of
 former trend talk. nevertheless, demian’s manner of
 introducing subject, seemed lack coherence our
 conversation.
 
spoke spirit europe, modern tendencies. everywhere,
 said, reigned desire come together, form herds, nowhere
 freedom love. life common, student clubs
 choral societies state, unnatural, forced phenomenon.
 community owed origin sense fear, embarrassment, to
 desire flight; inwardly rotten old, approaching a
 general break-up.
 
“community,” demian said, “is beautiful thing. see
 blossoming everywhere means that. will arise anew the
 mutual understanding individuals, time world will be
 remodeled. now called community merely formation herds.
 mankind seeks refuge together men fear one another--the
 masters combine ends, workmen theirs, the
 intellectuals theirs! afraid? one afraid

“and will happen us then?” asked.
 
“to us? oh, perhaps shall perish well. can also murder

late made halt garden river.
 
“we live here,” said demian. “come see us soon! shall expect
 you.”
 
cheerfully wended long way home night, had
 become cold. brawling students lurching through
 town. often felt, sometimes feeling privation,
 sometimes scorn, contrast curious sort of
 gaiety lonely life. now, tranquil strong sense of
 secret power felt never little affected me, how

however, reached distant dwelling went bed, these

 world rotten brink ruin--what me?
 waiting one single thing, fate might meet new

woke late morning deep sleep. day broke for
 solemn festal day, experienced since the

saw max demian, sitting stool curtained window. his

 me: seen like before! arms were

 slightly forward, open eyes, without sight, dead. the
 eyes glimmered dully little reflex light, piece of
 glass. pale face self-absorbed without expression, save
 great rigidity. looked like ancient mask animal

recollection came me--thus, exactly thus, seen
 him, many years ago, still quite boy. thus eyes
 stared inwards, thus hands lying motionless, close one

 years ago perhaps, looked just old ageless, wrinkle in
 face changed.

chapter one
 
two worlds
 

will begin story event time ten or
 eleven years old went latin school little town. much
 old-time fragrance wafted back me, sensations
 unmixed, pass review memories--dark streets and
 bright houses towers, striking clocks features of
 men, comfortable homely rooms, rooms full secrecy dread of
 ghosts. sense atmosphere cosy warmth, rabbits and
 servant-girls, household remedies dried fruit. two worlds passed
 one other. two poles came forth day night.
 
one world home, even narrower that, it
 really comprised parents. world part
 well known me; meant mother father, love severity,
 good example school. world subdued lustre, clarity
 cleanliness; tender friendly words, washed hands, clean
 clothes good manners. morning hymn sung, christmas
 kept.
 
world straight lines paths led future;
 duty guilt, evil conscience confession, pardon and
 good resolutions, love adoration, bible texts wisdom. this
 world future belong, crystal-pure, beautiful
 well ordered.
 
world, however, began right midst own
 household, entirely different, another odor, another
 manner speech made different promises demands. this
 second world servant-girls workmen, ghost stories breath
 scandal. gaily colored flood monstrous, tempting,
 terrible, enigmatical goings-on, things slaughter house and
 prison, drunken men scolding women, cows birth-throes, plunging
 horses, tales burglaries, murders, suicides. beautiful and
 dreadful, wild cruel things round about, next street,
 next house. policemen tramps passed fro, drunken
 men beat wives, crowds young girls flowed factories
 evening, old women able bewitch make ill,
 robbers dwelt wood, incendiaries rounded mounted
 policemen--everywhere seethed reeked second, passionate world,
 everywhere, except rooms, mother father were. and
 good thing. wonderful house there
 peace, order repose, duty good conscience, pardon and
 love--and wonderful also things, all
 loud shrill, sinister violent, yet one
 escape one bound mother.
 
oddest thing was, closely two worlds bordered each
 other, near were! instance, servant lina, as
 sat sitting-room door evening prayers, sang the
 hymn bright voice, freshly washed hands laid her
 smoothed-out apron, belonged absolutely father mother, us,
 bright proper. immediately after, kitchen in
 woodshed, telling tale headless dwarf,
 quarreled women neighborhood little
 butcher’s shop, another person, belonged other
 world, enveloped mystery. everything
 everyone, especially myself. sure, belonged the
 bright, respectable world, parents’ child, other
 world present everything saw heard, also lived in
 it, although often strange foreign me, although one had
 regularly bad conscience anxiety. sometimes even liked
 live forbidden world best, often homecoming the
 brightness--however necessary good might be--seemed almost like
 return something less beautiful, something uninteresting
 desolate. times realized this: aim life grow
 like father mother, bright pure, systematic and
 superior. road attainment long, go school
 study pass tests examinations. road led past other
 dark world it, improbable would

“yes,” said.
 
“really truly?”
 
“yes, really truly,” asserted defiantly, though inwardly was
 stifling fear.
 
“can swear it?”
 
terribly frightened, answered without hesitation: “yes.”
 
“then say: ‘i swear god that’s holy’!”

“no, don’t know; think it’s miller’s.”

turned old street left alone, astonished i
 ever before. scarcely gone everything he
 said seemed quite unbelievable! cain noble fellow, abel a
 coward! cain’s sign distinction! absurd, blasphemous
 infamous. god’s part matter? accepted
 abel’s sacrifice, love abel? demian’s story nonsense!
 suspected making fun wishing mislead me. the
 devil clever fellow, talk, but--well----
 
still, never thought much biblical other
 stories before. time past never completely
 forgotten frank kromer, hours, whole evening. home i
 read story again, stands bible, short
 clear. quite foolish try find special, secret
 meaning. one, every murderer look upon a
 favorite god! no, nonsense. demian nice way of
 saying things, easily pleasantly, everything were
 self-evident--and eyes!
 
ideas certainly little upset, rather much
 confused. lived bright, clean world, a
 sort abel, now firmly fixed had
 sunk deeply, really help it? my
 position now? reminiscence glowed moment almost
 took away breath. remembered wretched evening, my
 present misery dated, looked instant heart my
 father’s bright world despised wisdom! cain bore
 sign; imagined way shameful, distinction,
 wickedness unhappiness stood higher level my
 father, higher good pious people.
 
clear-thinking way experience then
 presented me, contained therein. only
 flaming feeling, strange emotions caused pain and
 yet filled pride.
 
considered matter, saw strangely demian spoken of
 fearless cowards! curiously explained mark
 cain’s forehead. singularly eyes lit up, peculiar
 eyes grown person! indistinctly shot brain: is
 himself, demian, sort cain? defend him, if
 feel like him? force gaze? he
 speak scornfully “others,” fearsome, really
 pious well-considered god?
 
thought led definite conclusion. stone fallen into
 well, well young soul. business cain,
 murder sign, long, long, time point
 seekings knowledge, doubts criticisms
 took departure.
 
noticed boys also occupied good deal with
 demian. told anyone version story cain,
 appeared interest others well. least, many rumors
 concerning “new boy” became current. still knew of
 them, help throw fresh light him, serve
 interpret him. remember first rumor demian’s
 mother rich. also said never went church,
 either. another rumor jews, they
 just easily been, secret, mohammedans. furthermore,
 tales told max demian’s strength. much certain, the
 strongest boy form, challenged fight, at
 refusal branded coward, suffered terrible humiliation his
 hands. said demian simply taken by
 nape neck one hand brought pressure to
 bear boy went white afterwards crawled away, for
 several days unable use arm. whole evening rumor
 even ran dead. time everything asserted and
 believed, everything exciting wonderful. was
 satiety rumors while. little later new ones circulated,
 asserted demian intimate relations girls “knew
 everything.”
 
meanwhile affair frank kromer took inevitable course. i
 get away him, although left peace for
 days together, still bound him. dreams lived my
 shadow, thus fantasy credited actions not,
 reality, do; dreams absolutely slave. lived
 dreams--i always deep dreamer--more reality.
 shadowy conceptions wasted strength life force. often
 dreamed, among things, kromer ill-treated me, spat
 knelt and, worse, led commit
 grave crimes--or rather led, simply forced, his
 powerful influence. terrible dreams, i
 woke half mad, presented murderous attack father.
 kromer whetted knife put hand, standing

troubles, still thought great deal cain and
 abel, much less demian. was, strangely enough, dream
 first came contact again. dreamed more, of
 assault ill-treatment suffered, instead kromer,
 time demian knelt upon me. and, quite new and
 profoundly impressive, everything suffered resistingly in
 torment hands kromer, suffered willingly demian, with
 feeling composed much joy fear. this
 dream twice, kromer occupied old position thoughts.
 
long time able separate experienced in
 dreams underwent reality. case evil

kromer came last. day stay long. poked several
 times ribs, laughed, took cake, even offered mouldy
 cigarette, however accept. friendly than

“oh,” said, went away, “before forget--next time can
 bring sister along, elder one. what’s name? now tell the
 truth.”
 
understand, gave answer. looked him
 wonderingly.
 
“don’t get me? must bring sister along.”
 
“but kromer, won’t do. mustn’t that, besides wouldn’t
 come.”
 
thought another pretext vexing me. often did
 that, requiring something impossible, terrifying me.
 often, humiliating me, degrees become more
 tractable. buy money other

time quite different. really angry my
 refusal.
 
“well,” said airily, “you’ll think it, won’t you? should
 like make sister’s acquaintance. will difficult.
 simply take walk, come along. to-morrow
 i’ll whistle you, can talk it.”
 
gone, glimpse meaning request dawned me.
 still quite child, knew hearsay boys girls,
 somewhat older, things forbidden, things
 secret scandalous nature. now also to--it
 suddenly quite clear monstrous was! immediately
 resolved never that. scarcely dared think would
 happen case kromer revenge me. new
 torment began, yet tortured enough.
 
walked disconsolately across empty square, hands my
 pockets. fresh torments, new servitude!
 
suddenly fresh, deep voice called me. terrified began to
 run on. someone ran me, hand gripped behind. max
 demian.
 
let taken prisoner. surrendered.
 
“it’s you?” said uncertainly. “you frightened so!”
 
looked me, never glance like an
 adult, superior penetrating person. long time past we
 spoken one another.
 
“i sorry,” said courteous time very
 determined manner. “but listen, mustn’t let frightened
 like that.”
 
“oh, can happen sometimes.”
 
“so appears. look here: shrink like someone
 hasn’t hurt you, someone begins think. makes him
 curious, wonders can matter. somebody thinks to
 himself, awfully frightened are, thinks further: one is
 like one terrified. cowards always frightened;
 believe aren’t really coward. ain’t right? course, you
 aren’t hero either. things afraid. there
 also people afraid. never be. no
 one ever afraid people. aren’t afraid me? or
 you, perhaps?”
 
“oh no, course not.”
 
“there, see. people afraid of?”
 
“i don’t know ... let go, want me?”
 
kept pace me--i going quicker idea escaping--i
 felt look directed side.
 
“just assume,” began again, “that mean well you. any
 case needn’t afraid me. much like try
 experiment you--it’s funny, can learn something
 that’s useful. listen: often practise art called
 mind-reading. there’s witchcraft it, seems peculiar

 isn’t it?”
 
looked helplessly face, serious prudent as
 always, kind well, without tenderness--his features were
 rather severe. righteousness something akin lay therein. not
 conscious happening; stood like magician me.
 
“have understood?” questioned again.
 
nodded. speak.
 
“i told mind-reading looked rather strange, process is
 quite natural. example tell less exactly what
 thought told story cain abel.
 nothing matter hand. also think it
 possible dreamed me. let’s leave out! you’re

“oh, no! don’t understand.”
 
“let’s keep old experiment! found that: boy s. is

 secret person, causes much disquietude. is
 right?”
 
dream lay influence voice, his
 personality. nodded. voice talking there, could
 come myself? knew all? knew better,

demian gave powerful slap shoulder.
 
“that’s right then. thought so. now just one question more: you
 know name boy just gone away?”
 
sank back, key secret, secret twisted
 back inside want see light.
 
“what sort fellow? one there, except myself.”
 
laughed.
 
“don’t afraid tell me,” said laughingly. “what’s name?”
 
whispered: “do mean frank kromer?”
 
nodded contentedly.
 
“bravo! you’re smart chap, shall good friends yet. now i
 must tell something else: kromer, whatever name is, is
 nasty fellow. face tells he’s rascal! think?”
 
“oh yes,” sobbed out, “he nasty, he’s devil! mustn’t know
 anything! god’s sake, mustn’t know anything. d’you know him?
 know you?”
 
“don’t worry! he’s gone, doesn’t know me--not yet. should
 like make acquaintance. goes public school?”
 
“yes.”
 
“in standard?”
 
“in fifth. don’t say anything him! please, don’t say
 anything him!”
 
“don’t worry, nothing will happen you. suppose wouldn’t like
 tell little fellow kromer?”
 
“i can’t! no, let go!”
 
silent while.
 
“it’s pity,” said, “we might able carry the
 experiment still further. don’t want bother you. know,
 don’t you, right afraid him? fear
 quite undermines us, must get rid it. must get rid it, if
 want become real man. d’you understand?”
 
“certainly, quite right ... won’t do. don’t know....”
 
“you seen know lot, thought. owe him
 money?”
 
“yes, do, isn’t essential point. can’t tell, can’t!”
 
“it won’t help matters, then, give amount owe him? i
 well let it.”
 
“no, no, point. please: don’t say anything to
 anybody! word! making miserable!”
 
“rely me, sinclair. later can share secrets me.”
 
“never, never!” exclaimed vehemently.
 
“just please. mean, perhaps will tell something
 later on. free will, understand. surely you
 don’t think shall act like kromer?”
 
“oh no--but don’t even know anything it!”
 
“absolutely nothing. think it. shall never act like
 kromer, believe me. besides, don’t owe anything.”
 
remained long time silent, became tranquil. but
 demian’s knowledge became puzzle me.
 
“i’m going home now,” said, rain drew coat more
 closely him. “i like repeat one thing you,
 since gone far matter--you get rid this
 fellow! nothing else done, kill him! would
 impress please me, that. besides, help
 you.”
 
terrified. suddenly remembered story cain. had
 uncanny feeling began cry softly. much weird
 seemed surround me.
 
“all right,” max demian said, smilingly. “go home now! will put
 things square, although murder simplest. such
 matters simplest way always best. aren’t good hands,
 friend kromer.”
 
came home, seemed away year.
 everything looked different. kromer now stood
 something like future freedom, something like hope. lonely no
 longer! realized first time terribly lonely i
 weeks weeks. immediately recollected had
 several occasions turned mind: confession my
 parents afford relief yet quite liberate me. now
 almost confessed, another, stranger, strong
 perfume wafted me, sensed presentiment salvation!
 
still fear far overcome, still prepared for
 long terrible mental wrestlings evil genius. all
 remarkable everything passed secretly
 quietly.
 
kromer’s whistle remained absent house day, two days,
 three days, whole week. dared believe senses, lay
 inwardly watch, see whether suddenly stand
 me, just moment expect longer. but
 was, remained, away! distrustful new freedom, still
 bring believe whole-heartedly. at
 last met frank kromer. coming street, straight in
 direction. saw me, drew together, twisted his
 features brutal grimace, turned away without ado, in
 order avoid meeting me.
 
wonderful moment me! enemy ran away me! devil
 afraid me! surprise joy shook through!
 
days demian showed again. waited me
 outside school.
 
“hullo,” said.
 
“good morning, sinclair. wanted hear you’re getting on.
 kromer leaves peace, doesn’t he?”
 
“did manage that? it? how? don’t understand
 it. hasn’t come near me.”
 
“splendid. come again--i don’t think will, he’s a
 cheeky fellow--then simply tell remember demian.”
 
“but mean? fight thrashed
 him?”
 
“no, i’m keen that. simply talked him, you,
 made clear advantage leave you
 peace.”
 
“oh, haven’t given money?”
 
“no, kid. already tried way yourself.”
 
attempted pump matter, disengaged himself. the
 old, embarrassed feeling concerning came me--an odd mixture of
 gratitude shyness, admiration fear, affection inward
 resistance.
 
intention seeing soon, wanted talk
 everything, cain affair well. see
 him. gratitude one virtues believe, to
 require child seem wrong. wonder very
 much complete ingratitude evinced towards max demian.
 to-day believe positively ruined life if

 felt release greatest event young life--but left
 deliverer one side soon accomplished miracle.
 
said, ingratitude seems nothing strange. solely, the
 lack curiosity evinced odd. possible could
 continue single day quiet mode life without coming nearer
 secrets demian brought contact? could
 restrain desire hear cain, kromer, more
 thought-reading?
 
scarcely comprehensible, yet so. suddenly saw myself
 extricated demoniacal toils, saw world lying
 bright cheerful me. longer subject paroxysms

 condemned creature, schoolboy again. temperament sought

 damning recollection awful servitude kromer, and
 sought recover former happy, contented mental outlook, to

lofty feelings celebrated readmission the

 story repeated, questions exclamations wonder followed in
 quick succession, parents stroked hair breathed deeply, as
 relief long oppression. lovely, like stories
 read, discords resolved happy ending.

“no,” said, “that can’t done. say, one hasn’t free

faith matters religion meanwhile suffered many breach.
 yet manner thinking, entirely influence of

 professed entire disbelief. let occasional

conclusion lesson demian said contemplatively:
 
“there’s something this, sinclair, don’t like. read through

 mean business two thieves. it’s sublime, three crosses

dismayed. believed quite familiar the

 little personal judgment brought bear it, little

 it. demian’s new ideas, therefore, quite annoying, threatening
 overthrow conceptions, stability believed it
 necessary maintain. no, one deal anything and
 everything like that, certainly holiest.
 
always, noticed opposition immediately, even had
 spoken word.
 
“i know,” said he, tone resignation, “it’s old story.
 everything right you’re serious it! i’ll tell
 something: one points one can clearly see
 shortcomings religion. fact god, the
 old new dispensation, may excellent conception, but
 really be. everything good,

 official godly world suppressed devil’s world, exactly

 suddenly dawned me, recognition inspired fear and
 awe suddenly felt extent innermost personal

without realized it, organist pistorius given a

 room adjoining stood open, max set chemical laboratory.
 came bright, white light spring sun, shining
 rain clouds. thought one pulled back one of
 curtains.
 
saw max demian, sitting stool curtained window. his
 attitude cramped oddly changed. thought flashed
 me: seen like before! arms were
 motionless side, hands lap; face inclined
 slightly forward, open eyes, without sight, dead. the
 eyes glimmered dully little reflex light, piece of
 glass. pale face self-absorbed without expression, save
 great rigidity. looked like ancient mask animal
 door temple. appeared breathing.
 
recollection came me--thus, exactly thus, seen
 him, many years ago, still quite boy. thus eyes
 stared inwards, thus hands lying motionless, close one
 another, fly crawling face. then, six
 years ago perhaps, looked just old ageless, wrinkle in
 face changed.
 
frightened, went softly room stairs.

 seen like before. shadow came window, bright
 white sun suddenly disappeared.
 
“i went max’s room,” whispered hastily. “has anything happened?

“but didn’t wake him?” asked quickly.
 
“no. hear me. came immediately. mother eve, tell me,

 raindrops tasted like tears.
 
“shall go see is?” asked whisper.
 
smiled weakly.
 
“don’t child, sinclair!” admonished loudly, relieve
 feelings. “go now come back later, talk you
 now.”
 
went. walked house town, towards the
 mountains. thin rain falling obliquely, clouds driving
 low altitude heavy pressure, fear. there
 hardly breeze, heights storm seemed be
 raging. several times sun, pale bright, broke instant
 steely grey clouds.
 
came fleecy, yellow cloud driving across sky. collided

 hail rattled down. short burst thunder unnatural and
 terrific sound cracked whipped landscape. immediately after
 sun broke mountains close hand brown
 woods glistened, pale unreal, fresh snow.
 
returned several hours, wet rain wind, demian
 opened front door me.
 
took room. gas flame burned the
 laboratory, paper lay about, appeared working.
 
“sit down,” invited, “you must tired, terrible storm;
 it’s evident, overtaken it. tea coming once.”
 
“something matter to-day,” began hesitatingly, “it can’t only
 bit storm.”
 
looked penetratingly.
 
“have seen anything?”
 
“yes. saw picture clearly clouds, instant.”
 
“what sort picture?”
 
“it bird.”
 
“the hawk? that? bird dream?”
 
“yes, hawk. yellow giant size, flew into
 blue-black heaven.”
 
demian took deep breath. someone knocked door. aged
 servant brought tea.
 
“take cup, sinclair, do. don’t think chance saw the
 bird.”
 
“chance? one see things chance?”
 
“well, no. means something. know what?”
 
“no. feel, means violent shock, approach fate. i
