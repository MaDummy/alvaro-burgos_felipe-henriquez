_walt whitman somewhere fine just distinction “loving
 allowance” “loving personal love.” distinction applies
 books well men women; case very
 numerous authors objects personal affection, it
 brings curious consequence it. much difference as
 best work case others loved “by
 allowance” convention, felt right and
 proper thing love them. sect--fairly large yet
 unusually choice--of austenians janites, probably be
 found partisans claim primacy almost every one the
 novels. delightful freshness humour of_ northanger
 abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure undoubted
 critical facts scale small, scheme, all, that
 burlesque parody, kind first rank reached with
 difficulty._ persuasion, _relatively faint tone, enthralling
 interest, devotees exalt others exquisite
 delicacy keeping. catastrophe of_ mansfield park _is admittedly
 theatrical, hero heroine insipid, author almost
 wickedly destroyed romantic interest expressly admitting that
 edmund took fanny mary shocked him, fanny might
 likely taken crawford little assiduous;
 yet matchless rehearsal-scenes characters mrs. norris and
 others secured, believe, considerable party it._ sense and
 sensibility _has perhaps fewest out-and-out admirers; does
 want them._
 
_i suppose, however, majority least competent votes
 would, things considered, divided between_ emma _and present
 book; perhaps vulgar verdict (if indeed fondness miss
 austen patent exemption possible charge

 popular; author time composition seen rather

 peculiar characteristic dialogue; figures miss bates, the
 eltons, unite suffrages everybody. hand,

 seems perfect, characteristic, most
 eminently quintessential author’s works; contention
 narrow space permitted me, propose show
 cause._
 
_in first place, book (it may barely necessary remind the
 reader) first shape written early, somewhere 1796,
 miss austen barely twenty-one; though revised and
 finished chawton fifteen years later, published till
 1813, four years death. know whether, this
 combination fresh vigorous projection youth, the
 critical revision middle life, may traced distinct
 superiority point construction, which, seems me, it
 possesses others. plot, though elaborate, almost
 regular enough fielding; hardly character, hardly incident

 minor passages--the loves jane bingley, advent mr.
 collins, visit hunsford, derbyshire tour--fit the
 unostentatious, masterly fashion. attempt the

 wickham, awkwardness (arising equal naturalness) from

 playwright ever laid upon_ pride prejudice; _and dare
 say that, were, situations prove startling or
 garish enough footlights, character-scheme subtle and
 delicate pit gallery. attempt made, would
 certainly hampered loosenesses construction,
 which, sometimes disguised conveniences novelist can
 avail himself, appear stage._
 
_i think, however, though thought will doubtless seem heretical to
 one school critics, construction highest
 merit, choicest gift, novelist. sets gifts

_the characteristics miss austen’s humour subtle delicate
 are, perhaps, times easier apprehend to
 express, particular time likely differently

 greater affinity, whole, addison of
 numerous species great british genus. differences of
 scheme, time, subject, literary convention, are, course,
 obvious enough; difference sex not, perhaps, count much,
 distinctly feminine element “mr. spectator,” in
 jane austen’s genius was, though nothing mannish, much was
 masculine. likeness quality consists great number of

 savagery swift, mildness miss austen boisterousness

 protest. yet, mr. addison miss austen is, though a

 roasting cutting fool. man early eighteenth century,

 written rather ladylike intelligent lydia bennet the
 days lydia’s great-grandmother; while, hand, (i
 think unreasonably) found “cynicism” touches miss austen’s
 own, satire mrs. musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over
 son. word “cynical” one misused the
 english language, especially when, glaring gratuitous
 falsification original sense, applied, rough and
 snarling invective, gentle oblique satire. cynicism means
 perception “the side,” sense “the accepted hells
 beneath,” consciousness motives nearly always mixed, and
 seem identical be--if cynicism, then
 every man woman fool, care live a

 cynic. sense miss austen certainly one. may even
 one sense that, like mr. bennet, she
 took epicurean delight dissecting, displaying, setting at
 work fools mean persons. think take delight,
 think worse woman, she
 immensely better artist._
 
_in respect art generally, mr. goldwin smith truly observed
 “metaphor exhausted depicting perfection it,
 combined narrowness field;” justly added that

 term miniature restricted sense, must think rather memling

 gravest fears, studies, ways, conduct were

 mary wollstonecraft protested better general sense particular

 even black one._
 
_for knowledge extended, knew two things which
 genius knows. one humanity, art. the

 myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build picture like magic.
 nothing false; nothing superfluous. (to take present book
 only) mr. collins changed mind jane elizabeth “while mrs.
 bennet stirring fire” (and know_ _mrs. bennet have
 stirred fire), mr. darcy “brought coffee-cup back_
 himself,” _the touch case like swift--“taller the
 breadth nail”--which impressed half-reluctant thackeray with
 just outspoken admiration. indeed, fantastic may seem, i
 put miss austen near swift ways, put her
 addison others._
 
_this swiftian quality appears present novel appears
 nowhere else character immortal, ineffable mr.

 humanity, philistinism, well-meaning hide-bound morality,

_but greatness mr. collins satisfactorily

 readers pleasant shocks, delightful thrills, felt by
 readers swift, fielding, may add, thackeray, as
 felt readers english author fiction

_the goodness minor characters in_ pride prejudice _has been
 already alluded to, makes detailed dwelling beauties

 glanced at, easy say whether exquisitely

 respect peculiar kind; doubtless), one regards mr.
 collins, draws moral lydia’s fall. sometimes wish

_the bingleys gardiners lucases, miss darcy miss de
 bourgh, jane, wickham, rest, must pass without special comment,
 remark charlotte lucas (her egregious papa, though
 delightful, just little thither side line between
 comedy farce) wonderfully clever study drab one kind, and
 wickham (though something miss austen’s hesitation touch in
 dealing young men appears) much less notable sketch in
 drab another. genius made charlotte is, yet
 disagreeable; wickham is, without investing either with
 cheap don juanish attractiveness disgusting rascality. the
 hero heroine tints dismissed._
 
_darcy always seemed far best interesting of
 miss austen’s heroes; possible competitor henry tilney,
 whose part slight simple hardly enters into
 comparison. sometimes, believe, urged pride is

_the secret charm many men women, miss austen
 downwards, felt, like charms thing rather

 five thousand year. fine thing girls!”
 
“how so? can affect them?”
 
“my dear mr. bennet,” replied wife, “how can tiresome? you
 must know thinking marrying one them.”
 
“is design settling here?”
 
“design? nonsense, can talk so! likely he
 _may_ fall love one them, therefore must visit as

“i see occasion that. girls may go--or may send

 handsome them, mr. bingley might like best the

“my dear, flatter me. certainly _have_ share beauty, but
 pretend anything extraordinary now. woman five

“in cases, woman often much beauty think of.”
 
“but, dear, must indeed go see mr. bingley comes into

“it engage for, assure you.”
 
“but consider daughters. think establishment would

“you scrupulous, surely. dare say mr. bingley will very

 hearty consent marrying whichever chooses girls--though
 must throw good word little lizzy.”
 
“i desire will thing. lizzy bit better the

“they none much recommend them,” replied he: “they are
 silly ignorant like girls; lizzy something of

“you mistake me, dear. high respect nerves. they

mr. bennet among earliest waited mr. bingley. he
 always intended visit him, though last always assuring his
 wife go; till evening visit was
 paid knowledge it. disclosed following
 manner. observing second daughter employed trimming hat, he
 suddenly addressed with,--
 
“i hope mr. bingley will like it, lizzy.”
 
“we way know _what_ mr. bingley likes,” said mother,
 resentfully, “since visit.”
 
“but forget, mamma,” said elizabeth, “that shall meet the
 assemblies, mrs. long promised introduce him.”
 
“i believe mrs. long will thing. two nieces
 own. selfish, hypocritical woman, opinion
 her.”
 
“no i,” said mr. bennet; “and glad find do
 depend serving you.”
 
mrs. bennet deigned make reply; but, unable contain
 herself, began scolding one daughters.
 
“don’t keep coughing so, kitty, heaven’s sake! little
 compassion nerves. tear pieces.”
 
“kitty discretion coughs,” said father; “she times
 ill.”
 
“i cough amusement,” replied kitty, fretfully. “when
 next ball be, lizzy?”
 
“to-morrow fortnight.”
 
“ay, is,” cried mother, “and mrs. long come back till
 day before; so, will impossible introduce him, for
 will know herself.”
 
“then, dear, may advantage friend, introduce
 mr. bingley _her_.”
 
“impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, acquainted him
 myself; can teasing?”
 
“i honour circumspection. fortnight’s acquaintance certainly
 little. one know man really end a
 fortnight. _we_ venture, somebody else will; after
 all, mrs. long nieces must stand chance; and, therefore,
 will think act kindness, decline office, i
 will take myself.”
 
girls stared father. mrs. bennet said only, “nonsense,
 nonsense!”
 
“what can meaning emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “do
 consider forms introduction, stress laid on
 them, nonsense? quite agree _there_. say you,
 mary? young lady deep reflection, know, read
 great books, make extracts.”
 
mary wished say something sensible, knew how.
 
“while mary adjusting ideas,” continued, “let us return mr.
 bingley.”
 
“i sick mr. bingley,” cried wife.
 
“i sorry hear _that_; tell before? i
 known much morning, certainly called on
 him. unlucky; actually paid visit, we
 escape acquaintance now.”
 
astonishment ladies just wished--that mrs.
 bennet perhaps surpassing rest; though first tumult joy
 over, began declare expected the
 while.
 
“how good you, dear mr. bennet! knew should
 persuade last. sure loved girls well to
 neglect acquaintance. well, pleased am! a
 good joke, too, gone morning, never said a
 word till now.”
 
“now, kitty, may cough much choose,” said mr. bennet; and,
 spoke, left room, fatigued raptures wife.
 
“what excellent father have, girls,” said she, door was
 shut. “i know will ever make amends kindness;
 either, matter. time life, so
 pleasant, can tell you, making new acquaintances every day; but
 sakes anything. lydia, love, though _are_
 youngest, dare say mr. bingley will dance next
 ball.”
 
“oh,” said lydia, stoutly, “i afraid; though _am_ the
 youngest, i’m tallest.”
 
rest evening spent conjecturing soon would
 return mr. bennet’s visit, determining ask to
 dinner.

jane elizabeth alone, former, cautious in
 praise mr. bingley before, expressed sister much
 admired him.
 
“he just young-man be,” said she, “sensible,

“he also handsome,” replied elizabeth, “which young man ought

“i much flattered asking dance second time. i

“did you? _i_ you. one great difference between

“dear lizzy!”
 
“oh, great deal apt, know, like people general.

“i wish hasty censuring anyone; always speak

“i know do: _that_ makes wonder. _your_

“certainly not, first; pleasing women you
 converse them. miss bingley live brother, keep

five o’clock two ladies retired dress, half-past six
 elizabeth summoned dinner. civil inquiries then
 poured in, amongst pleasure distinguishing the
 much superior solicitude mr. bingley, make very
 favourable answer. jane means better. sisters, hearing
 this, repeated three four times much grieved, how
 shocking bad cold, excessively disliked
 ill themselves; thought matter: their
 indifference towards jane, immediately them, restored
 elizabeth enjoyment original dislike.
 
brother, indeed, one party could
 regard complacency. anxiety jane evident, his
 attentions pleasing; prevented feeling
 much intruder believed considered the
 others. little notice him. miss bingley was
 engrossed mr. darcy, sister scarcely less so; mr.
 hurst, elizabeth sat, indolent man, lived to
 eat, drink, play cards, who, found prefer plain
 dish ragout, nothing say her.
 
dinner over, returned directly jane, miss bingley
 began abusing soon room. manners were
 pronounced bad indeed,--a mixture pride impertinence:
 conversation, style, taste, beauty. mrs. hurst
 thought same, added,--
 
“she nothing, short, recommend her, excellent
 walker. shall never forget appearance morning. really
 looked almost wild.”
 
“she indeed, louisa. hardly keep countenance. very
 nonsensical come all! must _she_ scampering the
 country, sister cold? hair untidy, blowzy!”
 
“yes, petticoat; hope saw petticoat, six inches deep
 mud, absolutely certain, gown let to
 hide office.”
 
“your picture may exact, louisa,” said bingley; “but was
 lost upon me. thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well
 came room morning. dirty petticoat quite
 escaped notice.”
 
“_you_ observed it, mr. darcy, sure,” said miss bingley; “and am
 inclined think wish see _your sister_ make such
 exhibition.”
 
“certainly not.”
 
“to walk three miles, four miles, five miles, whatever is,
 ancles dirt, alone, quite alone! mean by
 it? seems show abominable sort conceited independence,
 country-town indifference decorum.”
 
“it shows affection sister pleasing,” said
 bingley.
 
“i afraid, mr. darcy,” observed miss bingley, half whisper,
 “that adventure rather affected admiration fine
 eyes.”
 
“not all,” replied: “they brightened exercise.” a
 short pause followed speech, mrs. hurst began again,--
 
“i excessive regard jane bennet,--she really sweet
 girl,--and wish heart well settled. such
 father mother, low connections, afraid no
 chance it.”
 
“i think heard say uncle attorney in
 meryton?”
 
“yes; another, lives somewhere near cheapside.”
 
“that capital,” added sister; laughed heartily.
 
“if uncles enough fill _all_ cheapside,” cried bingley, “it
 make one jot less agreeable.”
 
“but must materially lessen chance marrying men any
 consideration world,” replied darcy.
 
speech bingley made answer; sisters gave their
 hearty assent, indulged mirth time expense of
 dear friend’s vulgar relations.
 
renewal tenderness, however, repaired room on
 leaving dining-parlour, sat till summoned coffee.
 still poorly, elizabeth quit all, till
 late evening, comfort seeing asleep, and
 appeared rather right pleasant go
 stairs herself. entering drawing-room, found whole
 party loo, immediately invited join them; suspecting
 playing high, declined it, making sister the
 excuse, said amuse herself, short time stay
 below, book. mr. hurst looked astonishment.
 
“do prefer reading cards?” said he; “that rather singular.”
 
“miss eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, “despises cards. great
 reader, pleasure anything else.”
 
“i deserve neither praise censure,” cried elizabeth; “i
 _not_ great reader, pleasure many things.”
 
“in nursing sister sure pleasure,” said bingley; “and
 hope will soon increased seeing quite well.”
 
elizabeth thanked heart, walked towards table
 books lying. immediately offered fetch her
 others; library afforded.
 
“and wish collection larger benefit own
 credit; idle fellow; though many, more
 ever looked into.”
 
elizabeth assured suit perfectly those
 room.
 
“i astonished,” said miss bingley, “that father left
 small collection books. delightful library at
 pemberley, mr. darcy!”
 
“it good,” replied: “it work many
 generations.”
 
“and added much yourself--you always buying
 books.”
 
“i comprehend neglect family library days as
 these.”
 
“neglect! sure neglect nothing can add beauties of
 noble place. charles, build _your_ house, wish may be
 half delightful pemberley.”
 
“i wish may.”
 
“but really advise make purchase that
 neighbourhood, take pemberley kind model. a
 finer county england derbyshire.”
 
“with heart: will buy pemberley itself, darcy will sell it.”
 
“i talking possibilities, charles.”
 
“upon word, caroline, think possible get
 pemberley purchase imitation.”
 
elizabeth much caught passed, leave little
 attention book; and, soon laying wholly aside, drew near
 card-table, stationed mr. bingley eldest
 sister, observe game.
 
“is miss darcy much grown since spring?” said miss bingley: “will
 tall am?”
 
“i think will. now miss elizabeth bennet’s height, or
 rather taller.”
 
“how long see again! never met anybody delighted me
 much. countenance, manners, extremely accomplished
 age! performance pianoforte exquisite.”
 
“it amazing me,” said bingley, “how young ladies can patience
 accomplished are.”
 
“all young ladies accomplished! dear charles, mean?”
 
“yes, them, think. paint tables, cover screens, and
 net purses. scarcely know one this; am
 sure never heard young lady spoken first time, without
 informed accomplished.”
 
“your list common extent accomplishments,” said darcy, “has
 much truth. word applied many woman deserves no
 otherwise netting purse covering screen; very
 far agreeing estimation ladies general. i
 boast knowing half-a-dozen whole range my
 acquaintance really accomplished.”
 
“nor i, sure,” said miss bingley.
 
“then,” observed elizabeth, “you must comprehend great deal your
 idea accomplished woman.”
 
“yes; comprehend great deal it.”
 
“oh, certainly,” cried faithful assistant, “no one can really
 esteemed accomplished greatly surpass usually met
 with. woman must thorough knowledge music, singing, drawing,
 dancing, modern languages, deserve word; and, besides all
 this, must possess certain something air manner of
 walking, tone voice, address expressions, word
 will half deserved.”
 
“all must possess,” added darcy; “and must yet add
 something substantial improvement mind extensive
 reading.”
 
“i longer surprised knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
 rather wonder now knowing _any_.”
 
“are severe upon sex doubt possibility all
 this?”
 
“_i_ never saw woman. _i_ never saw capacity, taste, and
 application, elegance, describe, united.”
 
mrs. hurst miss bingley cried injustice her
 implied doubt, protesting knew many women who
 answered description, mr. hurst called order, with
 bitter complaints inattention going forward. all
 conversation thereby end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the
 room.
 
“eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, door closed her, “is
 one young ladies seek recommend other
 sex undervaluing own; many men, daresay, it
 succeeds; but, opinion, paltry device, mean art.”
 
“undoubtedly,” replied darcy, remark chiefly addressed,
 “there meanness _all_ arts ladies sometimes condescend
 employ captivation. whatever bears affinity cunning is
 despicable.”
 
miss bingley entirely satisfied reply to
 continue subject.
 
elizabeth joined say sister worse, and
 leave her. bingley urged mr. jones’s sent for

 mrs. bennet found miss bennet worse expected.
 
“indeed have, sir,” answer. “she great deal ill be

“removed!” cried bingley. “it must thought of. sister, am
 sure, will hear removal.”
 
“you may depend upon it, madam,” said miss bingley, cold civility,
 “that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention she
 remains us.”
 
mrs. bennet profuse acknowledgments.
 
“i sure,” added, “if good friends, not
 know become her, ill indeed, suffers a
 vast deal, though greatest patience world, is
 always way her, has, without exception, sweetest
 temper ever met with. often tell girls nothing to

 equal netherfield. will think quitting hurry, i
 hope, though short lease.”
 
“whatever done hurry,” replied he; “and therefore i
 resolve quit netherfield, probably five
 minutes. present, however, consider quite fixed here.”
 
“that exactly supposed you,” said elizabeth.
 
“you begin comprehend me, you?” cried he, turning towards her.
 
“oh yes--i understand perfectly.”
 
“i wish might take compliment; easily seen
 through, afraid, pitiful.”
 
“that happens. necessarily follow deep,
 intricate character less estimable one yours.”
 
“lizzy,” cried mother, “remember are, run in
 wild manner suffered home.”
 
“i know before,” continued bingley, immediately, “that were
 studier character. must amusing study.”
 
“yes; intricate characters _most_ amusing. at
 least advantage.”
 
“the country,” said darcy, “can general supply subjects for
 study. country neighbourhood move confined and
 unvarying society.”
 
“but people alter much, something new be
 observed ever.”
 
“yes, indeed,” cried mrs. bennet, offended manner mentioning a
 country neighbourhood. “i assure quite much _that_
 going country town.”
 
everybody surprised; darcy, looking moment,
 turned silently away. mrs. bennet, fancied gained complete
 victory him, continued triumph,--
 
“i see london great advantage country, for
 part, except shops public places. country vast deal
 pleasanter, it, mr. bingley?”
 
“when country,” replied, “i never wish leave it; and
 town, pretty much same. their
 advantages, can equally happy either.”
 
“ay, right disposition. that
 gentleman,” looking darcy, “seemed think country nothing
 all.”
 
“indeed, mamma, mistaken,” said elizabeth, blushing her
 mother. “you quite mistook mr. darcy. meant not
 variety people met country town, which
 must acknowledge true.”
 
“certainly, dear, nobody said were; meeting with
 many people neighbourhood, believe few
 neighbourhoods larger. know dine four-and-twenty families.”
 
nothing concern elizabeth enable bingley keep his
 countenance. sister less delicate, directed eye towards
 mr. darcy expressive smile. elizabeth, sake of
 saying something might turn mother’s thoughts, now asked if
 charlotte lucas longbourn since _her_ coming away.
 
“yes, called yesterday father. agreeable man sir
 william is, mr. bingley--is he? much man fashion! so
 genteel easy! always something say everybody. _that_
 idea good breeding; persons fancy very
 important never open mouths quite mistake matter.”
 
“did charlotte dine you?”
 
“no, go home. fancy wanted mince-pies. for
 part, mr. bingley, _i_ always keep servants can own
 work; _my_ daughters brought differently. everybody to
 judge themselves, lucases good sort girls, i
 assure you. pity handsome! _i_ think
 charlotte _very_ plain; particular friend.”
 
“she seems pleasant young woman,” said bingley.
 
“oh dear, yes; must plain. lady lucas herself
 often said so, envied jane’s beauty. like boast

 brother gardiner’s town much love her, my

 but, however, not. perhaps thought young. however, he
 wrote verses her, pretty were.”
 
“and ended affection,” said elizabeth, impatiently. “there has
 many one, fancy, overcome way. wonder first
 discovered efficacy poetry driving away love!”
 
“i used consider poetry _food_ love,” said darcy.
 
“of fine, stout, healthy love may. everything nourishes is
 strong already. slight, thin sort inclination, i
 convinced one good sonnet will starve entirely away.”
 
darcy smiled; general pause ensued made elizabeth
 tremble lest mother exposing again. longed to
 speak, think nothing say; short silence mrs.
 bennet began repeating thanks mr. bingley kindness to
 jane, apology troubling also lizzy. mr. bingley was
 unaffectedly civil answer, forced younger sister be
 civil also, say occasion required. performed part,
 indeed, without much graciousness, mrs. bennet satisfied, and
 soon afterwards ordered carriage. upon signal, youngest of
 daughters put forward. two girls whispering to
 whole visit; result was, the

 added, “i shall insist giving one also. shall tell colonel

 mr. darcy writing, miss bingley, seated near him, watching

 messages sister. mr. hurst mr. bingley piquet, and
 mrs. hurst observing game.
 
elizabeth took needlework, sufficiently amused in
 attending passed darcy companion. perpetual
 commendations lady either hand-writing, evenness

 exactly unison opinion each.
 
“how delighted miss darcy will receive letter!”
 
made answer.
 
“you write uncommonly fast.”
 
“you mistaken. write rather slowly.”
 
“how many letters must occasion write course a

“it fortunate, then, fall lot instead yours.”
 
“pray tell sister long see her.”
 
“i already told once, desire.”
 
“i afraid like pen. let mend you. mend

“thank you--but always mend own.”
 
“how can contrive write even?”
 
silent.
 
“tell sister delighted hear improvement harp,

“will give leave defer raptures till write again? at

“oh, consequence. shall see january. you
 always write charming long letters her, mr. darcy?”
 
“they generally long; whether always charming, me
 determine.”
 
“it rule me, person can write long letter with
 ease write ill.”
 
“that will compliment darcy, caroline,” cried her
 brother, “because _not_ write ease. studies much
 words four syllables. you, darcy?”
 
“my style writing different yours.”
 
“oh,” cried miss bingley, “charles writes careless way
 imaginable. leaves half words, blots rest.”
 
“my ideas flow rapidly time express them; which
 means letters sometimes convey ideas correspondents.”
 
“your humility, mr. bingley,” said elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”
 
“nothing deceitful,” said darcy, “than appearance of
 humility. often carelessness opinion, sometimes an
 indirect boast.”
 
“and two call _my_ little recent piece modesty?”
 
“the indirect boast; really proud defects in

 bennet morning, ever resolved quitting netherfield

 laudable precipitance must leave necessary business

“nay,” cried bingley, “this much, remember night the

 believed said true, believe this

 precipitance merely show ladies.”
 
“i daresay believed it; means convinced you

 go--and, another word, might stay month.”
 
“you proved this,” cried elizabeth, “that mr. bingley did

“i exceedingly gratified,” said bingley, “by converting my
 friend says compliment sweetness temper. am
 afraid giving turn gentleman means

“would mr. darcy consider rashness original intention

“upon word, exactly explain matter--darcy must speak for

“you expect account opinions choose call mine,

“to yield readily--easily--to _persuasion_ friend merit

“to yield without conviction compliment understanding of

“you appear me, mr. darcy, allow nothing influence of

“will advisable, proceed subject, arrange

“by means,” cried bingley; “let us hear particulars, not

 darcy great tall fellow, comparison with
 myself, pay half much deference. declare not
 know awful object darcy particular occasions, in
 particular places; house especially, sunday evening,

mr. darcy smiled; elizabeth thought perceive was
 rather offended, therefore checked laugh. miss bingley warmly
 resented indignity received, expostulation her
 brother talking nonsense.
 
“i see design, bingley,” said friend. “you dislike argument,
 want silence this.”
 
“perhaps do. arguments much like disputes. miss
 bennet will defer till room, shall very
 thankful; may say whatever like me.”
 
“what ask,” said elizabeth, “is sacrifice side; mr.
 darcy much better finish letter.”
 
mr. darcy took advice, finish letter.
 
business over, applied miss bingley elizabeth

 seated herself.

playing italian songs, miss bingley varied charm a
 lively scotch air; soon afterwards mr. darcy, drawing near
 elizabeth, said her,--
 
“do feel great inclination, miss bennet, seize an
 opportunity dancing reel?”
 
smiled, made answer. repeated question, some
 surprise silence.
 
“oh,” said she, “i heard before; immediately

“indeed dare.”
 
elizabeth, rather expected affront him, amazed his
 gallantry; mixture sweetness archness her

miss bingley saw, suspected, enough jealous; great
 anxiety recovery dear friend jane received some

often tried provoke darcy disliking guest, talking of
 supposed marriage, planning happiness alliance.
 
“i hope,” said she, walking together shrubbery the
 next day, “you will give mother-in-law hints, this

gentlemen entered, jane longer first object;
 miss bingley’s eyes instantly turned towards darcy, had
 something say advanced many steps. addressed
 directly miss bennet polite congratulation; mr. hurst
 also made slight bow, said “very glad;” diffuseness

 attention. first half hour spent piling fire, lest she
 suffer change room; removed, desire,

 elizabeth, work opposite corner, saw great
 delight.
 
tea mr. hurst reminded sister-in-law the
 card-table--but vain. obtained private intelligence mr.
 darcy wish cards, mr. hurst soon found even open
 petition rejected. assured one intended play, the
 silence whole party subject seemed justify her. mr.
 hurst had, therefore, nothing stretch one the
 sofas go sleep. darcy took book. miss bingley same;
 mrs. hurst, principally occupied playing bracelets and
 rings, joined now brother’s conversation miss
 bennet.
 
miss bingley’s attention quite much engaged watching mr.
 darcy’s progress _his_ book, reading own; was
 perpetually either making inquiry, looking page. she
 win him, however, conversation; merely answered her
 question read on. length, quite exhausted attempt be
 amused book, chosen the
 second volume his, gave great yawn said, “how pleasant it
 spend evening way! declare, all, no
 enjoyment like reading! much sooner one tires anything a
 book! house own, shall miserable not

one made reply. yawned again, threw aside book, and
 cast eyes round room quest amusement; when, hearing
 brother mentioning ball miss bennet, turned suddenly
 towards said,--
 
“by bye charles, really serious meditating dance at
 netherfield? advise you, determine it, consult
 wishes present party; much mistaken not
 among us ball rather punishment a
 pleasure.”
 
“if mean darcy,” cried brother, “he may go bed, he
 chooses, begins; ball, quite settled
 thing, soon nicholls made white soup enough shall send
 round cards.”
 
“i like balls infinitely better,” replied, “if were
 carried different manner; something insufferably
 tedious usual process meeting. surely much
 rational conversation instead dancing made order the
 day.”
 
“much rational, dear caroline, dare say; be
 near much like ball.”
 
miss bingley made answer, soon afterwards got walked about
 room. figure elegant, walked well; darcy, at
 aimed, still inflexibly studious. the
 desperation feelings, resolved one effort more; and,
 turning elizabeth, said,--
 
“miss eliza bennet, let persuade follow example, take a
 turn room. assure refreshing sitting so
 long one attitude.”
 
elizabeth surprised, agreed immediately. miss bingley
 succeeded less real object civility: mr. darcy looked
 up. much awake novelty attention quarter as
 elizabeth be, unconsciously closed book. was
 directly invited join party, declined it, observing that
 imagine two motives choosing walk down

“not all,” answer; “but, depend upon it, means be
 severe us, surest way disappointing will ask
 nothing it.”
 
miss bingley, however, incapable disappointing mr. darcy in
 anything, persevered, therefore, requiring explanation his
 two motives.
 
“i smallest objection explaining them,” said he, soon
 allowed speak. “you either choose method passing
 evening other’s confidence, secret
 affairs discuss, conscious figures
 appear greatest advantage walking: first, be
 completely way; second, can admire much better

“oh, shocking!” cried miss bingley. “i never heard anything so
 abominable. shall punish speech?”
 
“nothing easy, inclination,” said elizabeth. “we
 can plague punish one another. tease him--laugh him. intimate

“but upon honour _not_. assure intimacy not
 yet taught _that_. tease calmness temper presence mind! no,
 no; feel may defy us there. laughter, will expose
 ourselves, please, attempting laugh without subject. mr.
 darcy may hug himself.”
 
“mr. darcy laughed at!” cried elizabeth. “that an
 uncommon advantage, uncommon hope will continue, would
 great loss _me_ many acquaintance. dearly love a
 laugh.”
 
“miss bingley,” said he, “has given credit can be. the
 wisest best men,--nay, wisest best actions,--may
 rendered ridiculous person whose first object life a
 joke.”
 
“certainly,” replied elizabeth, “there people, hope am
 one _them_. hope never ridicule wise good. follies
 nonsense, whims inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, own, i
 laugh whenever can. these, suppose, precisely what
 without.”
 
“perhaps possible anyone. study of
 life avoid weaknesses often expose strong
 understanding ridicule.”
 
“such vanity pride.”
 
“yes, vanity weakness indeed. pride--where real
 superiority mind--pride will always good regulation.”
 
elizabeth turned away hide smile.
 
“your examination mr. darcy over, presume,” said miss bingley;
 “and pray result?”
 
“i perfectly convinced mr. darcy defect. owns it
 without disguise.”
 
“no,” said darcy, “i made pretension. faults enough,
 not, hope, understanding. temper dare vouch
 for. is, believe, little yielding; certainly little the
 convenience world. forget follies vices of
 others soon ought, offences myself. my
 feelings puffed every attempt move them. temper
 perhaps called resentful. good opinion lost lost for
 ever.”
 
“_that_ failing, indeed!” cried elizabeth. “implacable resentment
 _is_ shade character. chosen fault well. i
 really _laugh_ it. safe me.”
 
“there is, believe, every disposition tendency particular
 evil, natural defect, even best education can overcome.”
 
“and _your_ defect propensity hate everybody.”
 
“and yours,” replied, smile, “is wilfully misunderstand
 them.”
 
“do let us little music,” cried miss bingley, tired a
 conversation share. “louisa, will mind my
 waking mr. hurst.”
 
sister made smallest objection, pianoforte was
 opened; darcy, moments’ recollection, sorry for
 it. began feel danger paying elizabeth much attention.

“some time _will_ be--but shall _me_. till i

elizabeth honoured feelings, thought handsomer than

“but what,” said she, pause, “can motive? can

“a thorough, determined dislike me--a dislike but

“i thought mr. darcy bad this--though never liked

“i will trust subject,” replied wickham; “_i_ can

elizabeth deep thought, time exclaimed, “to

 with--“and one, too, probably companion from

“we born parish, within park; greatest

“how strange!” cried elizabeth. “how abominable! wonder very

 dishonesty must call it.”
 
“it _is_ wonderful,” replied wickham; “for almost actions may be
 traced pride; pride often best friend. has

“can abominable pride ever done good?”
 
“yes; often led liberal generous; give money

“what sort girl miss darcy?”
 
shook head. “i wish call amiable. gives pain to

many pauses many trials subjects, elizabeth not
 help reverting first, saying,--
 
“i astonished intimacy mr. bingley. can mr. bingley,
 seems good-humour itself, is, really believe, truly amiable,
 friendship man? can suit other? you
 know mr. bingley?”
 
“not all.”
 
“he sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. know mr.

“probably not; mr. darcy can please chooses. not
 want abilities. can conversible companion thinks worth

 different man less prosperous. pride
 never deserts him; rich liberal-minded, just,
 sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing
 something fortune figure.”
 
whist party soon afterwards breaking up, players gathered round
 table, mr. collins took station cousin
 elizabeth mrs. philips. usual inquiries success were
 made latter. great; lost every point;
 mrs. philips began express concern thereupon, assured
 her, much earnest gravity, least importance;
 considered money mere trifle, begged not
 make uneasy.
 
“i know well, madam,” said he, “that persons sit a
 card table must take chance things,--and happily i
 circumstances make five shillings object. there
 are, undoubtedly, many say same; but, thanks lady
 catherine bourgh, removed far beyond necessity regarding
 little matters.”
 
mr. wickham’s attention caught; observing mr. collins for
 moments, asked elizabeth low voice whether relations
 intimately acquainted family bourgh.
 
“lady catherine bourgh,” replied, “has lately given a
 living. hardly know mr. collins first introduced her

“you know course lady catherine bourgh lady anne darcy

“no, indeed, not. knew nothing lady catherine’s

 self-destined another.
 
“mr. collins,” said she, “speaks highly lady catherine her
 daughter; but, particulars related her

 patroness, arrogant, conceited woman.”
 
“i believe great degree,” replied wickham; “i have

 reputation remarkably sensible clever; rather believe

elizabeth allowed given rational account it, and
 continued talking together mutual satisfaction till supper put

elizabeth related jane, next day, passed mr.

 possibility really endured unkindness enough to
 interest tender feelings; nothing therefore remained be
 done think well both, defend conduct each, and
 throw account accident mistake whatever be
 otherwise explained.
 
“they both,” said she, “been deceived, dare say, way or
 other, can form idea. interested people perhaps
 misrepresented other. is, short, impossible us to
 conjecture causes circumstances may alienated them,
 without actual blame either side.”
 
“very true, indeed; now, dear jane, got say in
 behalf interested people probably concerned the
 business? clear _them_, too, shall obliged think ill of
 somebody.”
 
“laugh much choose, will laugh my
 opinion. dearest lizzy, consider disgraceful light

 impossible. man common humanity, man value his
 character, capable it. can intimate friends so
 excessively deceived him? oh no.”
 
“i can much easily believe mr. bingley’s imposed that
 mr. wickham invent history gave last
 night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. not
 so, let mr. darcy contradict it. besides, truth looks.”
 
“it difficult, indeed--it distressing. one know to
 think.”
 
“i beg pardon;--one knows exactly think.”
 
jane think certainty one point,--that mr.
 bingley, _had been_ imposed on, much suffer when
 affair became public.
 
two young ladies summoned shrubbery, this
 conversation passed, arrival persons whom
 speaking; mr. bingley sisters came give their
 personal invitation long expected ball netherfield, was
 fixed following tuesday. two ladies delighted see
 dear friend again, called age since met, and
 repeatedly asked since their
 separation. rest family paid little attention;
 avoiding mrs. bennet much possible, saying much elizabeth,
 nothing others. soon gone again, rising from
 seats activity took brother surprise, and
 hurrying eager escape mrs. bennet’s civilities.
 
prospect netherfield ball extremely agreeable every
 female family. mrs. bennet chose consider given in
 compliment eldest daughter, particularly flattered by
 receiving invitation mr. bingley himself, instead a
 ceremonious card. jane pictured happy evening the
 society two friends, attentions brother; and
 elizabeth thought pleasure dancing great deal mr.
 wickham, seeing confirmation everything mr. darcy’s look

 less single event, particular person; though they
 each, like elizabeth, meant dance half evening mr. wickham,
 means partner satisfy them, ball
 was, rate, ball. even mary assure family she
 disinclination it.
 
“while can mornings myself,” said she, “it enough. i
 think sacrifice join occasionally evening engagements.
 society claims us all; profess one who
 consider intervals recreation amusement desirable for
 everybody.”
 
elizabeth’s spirits high occasion, though did
 often speak unnecessarily mr. collins, help asking
 whether intended accept mr. bingley’s invitation, he
 did, whether think proper join evening’s
 amusement; rather surprised find entertained no
 scruple whatever head, far dreading rebuke,

“i means opinion, assure you,” said he, “that ball of

 cousins course evening; take opportunity of
 soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, two first dances especially; a
 preference trust cousin jane will attribute right
 cause, disrespect her.”
 
elizabeth felt completely taken in. fully proposed being
 engaged wickham dances; mr. collins
 instead!--her liveliness never worse timed. help
 it, however. mr. wickham’s happiness perforce
 delayed little longer, mr. collins’s proposal accepted as
 good grace could. better pleased his
 gallantry, idea suggested something more. now first

 consequence reply. mr. collins might never make offer, and,
 till did, useless quarrel him.

“i think speaking all. sir william have

“i sorry think so; case, can least be

“yes, always,” replied, without knowing said; her

“and never allow blinded prejudice?”
 
“i hope not.”
 
“it particularly incumbent never change opinion,

“may ask questions tend?”
 
“merely illustration _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring

“and success?”

“i can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary

“but take likeness now, may never another

“i means suspend pleasure yours,” coldly replied.

long separated miss bingley came towards her, and,
 expression civil disdain, thus accosted her,--
 
“so, miss eliza, hear quite delighted george wickham?

 questions; find young man forgot tell you, among his

“his guilt descent appear, account, same,”
 said elizabeth, angrily; “for heard accuse nothing
 worse mr. darcy’s steward, _that_, can
 assure you, informed himself.”
 
“i beg pardon,” replied miss bingley, turning away sneer.
 “excuse interference; kindly meant.”
 
“insolent girl!” said elizabeth herself. “you much mistaken if
 expect influence paltry attack this. see
 nothing wilful ignorance malice mr.
 darcy.” sought eldest sister, undertaken make
 inquiries subject bingley. jane met smile of
 sweet complacency, glow happy expression, sufficiently
 marked well satisfied occurrences evening.
 elizabeth instantly read feelings; and, moment, solicitude
 wickham, resentment enemies, everything else, gave
 way hope jane’s fairest way happiness.
 
“i want know,” said she, countenance less smiling her
 sister’s, “what learnt mr. wickham. perhaps have
 pleasantly engaged think third person, case

“no,” replied jane, “i forgotten him; nothing
 satisfactory tell you. mr. bingley know whole his

 principally offended mr. darcy; will vouch good conduct,

 mr. wickham deserved much less attention mr. darcy has
 received; sorry say account, well his

 afraid imprudent, deserved lose mr. darcy’s

“mr. bingley know mr. wickham himself.”
 
“no; never saw till morning meryton.”
 
“this account received mr. darcy. am
 perfectly satisfied. say living?”
 
“he exactly recollect circumstances, though heard
 mr. darcy once, believes left to

“i doubt mr. bingley’s sincerity,” said elizabeth warmly,
 “but must excuse convinced assurances only. mr.
 bingley’s defence friend able one, dare say; but
 since unacquainted several parts story, learnt
 rest friend himself, shall venture still think of

changed discourse one gratifying each, on
 difference sentiment. elizabeth listened with
 delight happy though modest hopes jane entertained of
 bingley’s regard, said power heighten confidence

“i found out,” said he, “by singular accident, now

“indeed am. shall entreat pardon done earlier.

elizabeth tried hard dissuade scheme; assuring him
 mr. darcy consider addressing without introduction as
 impertinent freedom, rather compliment aunt; it

 side, were, must belong mr. darcy, superior in
 consequence, begin acquaintance. mr. collins listened with

 discouraged speaking again, mr. darcy’s contempt seemed
 abundantly increasing length second speech; the
 end made slight bow, moved another way: mr.
 collins returned elizabeth.
 
“i reason, assure you,” said he, “to dissatisfied my
 reception. mr. darcy seemed much pleased attention. answered
 utmost civility, even paid compliment saying,

 attention almost entirely sister mr. bingley; the
 train agreeable reflections observations gave birth made
 perhaps almost happy jane. saw idea settled that

 concluded many good wishes lady lucas might soon equally

“what mr. darcy me, pray, afraid him? am

“for heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. advantage can you

“no, no, nonsense, lizzy. desire will stay are.” and
 upon elizabeth’s seeming really, vexed embarrassed looks, about

 continued,--

elizabeth sitting mother sisters, reflecting what
 heard, doubting whether authorized mention it,
 sir william lucas appeared, sent daughter to
 announce engagement family. many compliments them,
 much self-gratulation prospect connection the
 houses, unfolded matter,--to audience merely wondering,
 incredulous; mrs. bennet, perseverance than
 politeness, protested must entirely mistaken; lydia, always
 unguarded often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--
 
“good lord! sir william, can tell story? know
 mr. collins wants marry lizzy?”
 
nothing less complaisance courtier borne
 without anger treatment: sir william’s good-breeding carried
 all; though begged leave positive the
 truth information, listened impertinence the
 forbearing courtesy.
 
elizabeth, feeling incumbent relieve unpleasant
 situation, now put forward confirm account, by
 mentioning prior knowledge charlotte herself; and
 endeavoured put stop exclamations mother sisters,
 earnestness congratulations sir william, she
 readily joined jane, making variety remarks the
 happiness might expected match, excellent character

mrs. bennet was, fact, much overpowered say great deal while
 sir william remained; sooner left feelings
 found rapid vent. first place, persisted disbelieving
 whole matter; secondly, sure mr. collins
 taken in; thirdly, trusted never happy

 inferences, however, plainly deduced whole: one, that
 elizabeth real cause mischief; other, that
 barbarously used all; two
 points principally dwelt rest day. nothing could
 console nothing appease her. day wear her
 resentment. week elapsed see elizabeth without
 scolding her: month passed away speak sir william
 lady lucas without rude; many months gone she

mr. bennet’s emotions much tranquil occasion, such
 experience pronounced agreeable sort; for
 gratified him, said, discover charlotte lucas, had
 used think tolerably sensible, foolish wife, and
 foolish daughter!

 though mrs. bennet’s sour looks ill-natured remarks might been
 enough drive happiness away.

 mutually silent subject; elizabeth felt persuaded no
 real confidence ever subsist again. her
 disappointment charlotte made turn fonder regard her
 sister, whose rectitude delicacy sure opinion could
 never shaken, whose happiness grew daily anxious, as
 bingley now gone week, nothing heard return.
 
jane sent caroline early answer letter, counting
 days till might reasonably hope hear again. promised

 discharging conscience head, proceeded inform them,

neither jane elizabeth comfortable subject. day after
 day passed away without bringing tidings the
 report shortly prevailed meryton coming to
 netherfield whole winter; report highly incensed mrs.
 bennet, never failed contradict scandalous
 falsehood.
 
even elizabeth began fear--not bingley indifferent--but that
 sisters successful keeping away. unwilling she
 admit idea destructive jane’s happiness, so
 dishonourable stability lover, prevent its
 frequently recurring. united efforts two unfeeling sisters,
 overpowering friend, assisted attractions miss

mr. collins returned punctually monday fortnight, his

miss bingley’s letter arrived, put end doubt. first
 sentence conveyed assurance settled london for
 winter, concluded brother’s regret had
 time pay respects friends hertfordshire left
 country.
 
hope over, entirely over; jane attend rest of
 letter, found little, except professed affection the
 writer, give comfort. miss darcy’s praise occupied
 chief it. many attractions dwelt on; caroline
 boasted joyfully increasing intimacy, ventured predict
 accomplishment wishes unfolded former
 letter. wrote also great pleasure brother’s an
 inmate mr. darcy’s house, mentioned raptures plans of
 latter regard new furniture.
 
elizabeth, jane soon communicated chief this,
 heard silent indignation. heart divided concern

 assertion brother’s partial miss darcy, paid no
 credit. really fond jane, doubted she
 ever done; much always disposed like him, she
 think without anger, hardly without contempt, easiness
 temper, want proper resolution, now made slave
 designing friends, led sacrifice happiness to
 caprice inclinations. happiness, however, been
 sacrifice, might allowed sport in
 whatever manner thought best; sister’s involved it, as
 thought must sensible himself. subject, short, on
 reflection long indulged, must unavailing. she
 think nothing else; yet, whether bingley’s regard had
 really died away, suppressed friends’ interference;
 whether aware jane’s attachment, whether had
 escaped observation; whichever case, though opinion of
 must materially affected difference, sister’s
 situation remained same, peace equally wounded.
 
day two passed jane courage speak feelings to
 elizabeth; last, mrs. bennet’s leaving together, a
 longer irritation usual netherfield master, could
 help saying,--
 
“o dear mother command herself! can no
 idea pain gives continual reflections him. i
 will repine. last long. will forgot, shall

elizabeth looked sister incredulous solicitude, said
 nothing.
 
“you doubt me,” cried jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, no

 nothing reproach with. thank god _that_ pain. little

“my dear jane,” exclaimed elizabeth, “you good. sweetness

miss bennet eagerly disclaimed extraordinary merit, threw back
 praise sister’s warm affection.
 
“nay,” said elizabeth, “this fair. _you_ wish think the

 mrs. bennet many grievances relate, much complain of. they
 ill-used since last saw sister. two her

mrs. gardiner, chief news given before, in
 course jane elizabeth’s correspondence her, made her
 sister slight answer, and, compassion nieces, turned the
 conversation.
 
alone elizabeth afterwards, spoke subject.
 “it seems likely desirable match jane,” said she. “i
 sorry went off. things happen often! young man,
 describe mr. bingley, easily falls love pretty
 girl weeks, and, accident separates them, easily
 forgets her, sort inconstancies frequent.”

“an excellent consolation way,” said elizabeth; “but will not

 interference friends will persuade young man of
 independent fortune think girl violently in
 love days before.”
 
“but expression ‘violently love’ hackneyed, so
 doubtful, indefinite, gives little idea. as
 often applied feelings arise half hour’s
 acquaintance, real, strong attachment. pray, _violent was_
 mr. bingley’s love?”
 
“i never saw promising inclination; growing quite

 anything.”
 
elizabeth exceedingly pleased proposal, felt persuaded
 sister’s ready acquiescence.
 
“i hope,” added mrs. gardiner, “that consideration regard to
 young man will influence her. live different part of
 town, connections different, and, well know, go
 little, improbable meet all,
 unless really comes see her.”
 
“and _that_ quite impossible; now custody his
 friend, mr. darcy suffer call jane a
 part london! dear aunt, think it? mr. darcy may,
 perhaps, _heard_ place gracechurch street, he
 hardly think month’s ablution enough cleanse its
 impurities, enter it; and, depend upon it, mr. bingley
 never stirs without him.”
 
“so much better. hope will meet all. jane
 correspond sister? _she_ will able help calling.”
 
“she will drop acquaintance entirely.”
 
but, spite certainty elizabeth affected place this
 point, well still interesting one bingley’s being
 withheld seeing jane, felt solicitude subject which
 convinced her, examination, consider entirely
 hopeless. possible, sometimes thought probable, that
 affection might re-animated, influence friends
 successfully combated natural influence jane’s
 attractions.
 
miss bennet accepted aunt’s invitation pleasure; the
 bingleys otherwise thoughts time she
 hoped, caroline’s living house brother, she
 might occasionally spend morning her, without danger of
 seeing him.
 
gardiners stayed week longbourn; philipses,
 lucases, officers, day without its
 engagement. mrs. bennet carefully provided entertainment
 brother sister, sit family
 dinner. engagement home, officers always
 made part it, officers mr. wickham sure one; and
 occasions mrs. gardiner, rendered suspicious elizabeth’s
 warm commendation him, narrowly observed both. without supposing
 them, saw, seriously love, preference
 plain enough make little uneasy; she
 resolved speak elizabeth subject left
 hertfordshire, represent imprudence encouraging such
 attachment.
 
mrs. gardiner, wickham one means affording pleasure,
 unconnected general powers. ten dozen years ago,
 marriage, spent considerable time part
 derbyshire belonged. had, therefore, many
 acquaintance common; and, though wickham little since
 death darcy’s father, five years before, yet power
 give fresher intelligence former friends been
 way procuring.
 
mrs. gardiner seen pemberley, known late mr. darcy by
 character perfectly well. here, consequently, inexhaustible
 subject discourse. comparing recollection pemberley with
 minute description wickham give, bestowing her
 tribute praise character late possessor, was
 delighting herself. made acquainted the
 present mr. darcy’s treatment him, tried remember something of
 gentleman’s reputed disposition, quite lad, might
 agree it; confident, last, recollected having
 heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken proud,

“you sensible girl, lizzy, fall love merely you

“my dear aunt, serious indeed.”
 
“yes, hope engage serious likewise.”
 
“well, then, need alarm. will take care of
 myself, mr. wickham too. shall love me, i
 can prevent it.”
 
“elizabeth, serious now.”
 
“i beg pardon. will try again. present love with
 mr. wickham; no, certainly not. is, beyond comparison,
 agreeable man ever saw--and becomes really attached to

 sorry means making unhappy; but

“perhaps will well discourage coming very

 kindness hints, parted,--a wonderful instance advice
 given point without resented.
 
mr. collins returned hertfordshire soon quitted

“_that_ certainly shall.”
 
“and another favour ask. will come see me?”
 
“we shall often meet, hope, hertfordshire.”
 
“i likely leave kent time. promise me, therefore, to

elizabeth refuse, though foresaw little pleasure the
 visit.
 
“my father maria come march,” added charlotte, “and
 hope will consent party. indeed, eliza, will be
 welcome either them.”
 
wedding took place: bride bridegroom set kent from
 church door, everybody much say hear the
 subject usual. elizabeth soon heard friend, their
 correspondence regular frequent ever been: it
 equally unreserved impossible. elizabeth never
 address without feeling comfort intimacy over;
 and, though determined slacken correspondent, the
 sake rather was. charlotte’s first letters
 received good deal eagerness: be
 curiosity know speak new home, would
 like lady catherine, happy dare pronounce to

 expressed every point exactly might foreseen. she
 wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded comforts, mentioned nothing
 praise. house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
 roads, taste, lady catherine’s behaviour most
 friendly obliging. mr. collins’s picture hunsford and
 rosings rationally softened; elizabeth perceived must wait

 elizabeth’s mind; and, observation day altogether, she
 believed lady catherine exactly represented.
 
when, examining mother, whose countenance deportment
 soon found resemblance mr. darcy, turned eyes the
 daughter, almost joined maria’s astonishment her

“with three younger sisters grown up,” replied elizabeth, smiling, “your

lady catherine seemed quite astonished receiving direct answer;
 elizabeth suspected first creature ever

 towards look curiosity; ladyship, a
 while, shared feeling, openly acknowledged, not
 scruple call out,--
 
“what saying, fitzwilliam? talking

“we talking music, madam,” said he, longer able avoid

mr. darcy spoke affectionate praise sister’s proficiency.
 
“i glad hear good account her,” said lady
 catherine; “and pray tell me, expect excel,

“i assure you, madam,” replied, “that need advice.

mr. darcy looked little ashamed aunt’s ill-breeding, made
 answer.
 
coffee over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth having
 promised play him; sat directly instrument. he
 drew chair near her. lady catherine listened half song, then

“i shall say mistaken,” replied, “because could

elizabeth laughed heartily picture herself, said to
 colonel fitzwilliam, “your cousin will give pretty notion of

“i afraid you,” said he, smilingly.
 
“pray let hear accuse of,” cried colonel
 fitzwilliam. “i like know behaves among strangers.”
 
“you shall hear, then--but prepare something dreadful. the

“i time honour knowing lady assembly

“true; nobody can ever introduced ball-room. well, colonel
 fitzwilliam, play next? fingers wait orders.”
 
“perhaps,” said darcy, “i judged better sought an

“shall ask cousin reason this?” said elizabeth, still

“i certainly talent people possess,” said darcy,

“my fingers,” said elizabeth, “do move instrument the

darcy smiled said, “you perfectly right. employed your

interrupted lady catherine, called know

 lady catherine approached, and, listening minutes, said
 darcy,--

elizabeth looked darcy, see cordially assented his
 cousin’s praise: neither moment she

 bourgh derived comfort miss bingley, might have
 just likely marry _her_, relation.
 
lady catherine continued remarks elizabeth’s performance, mixing
 many instructions execution taste. elizabeth received
 forbearance civility; request the
 gentlemen remained instrument till ladyship’s carriage was

“how suddenly quitted netherfield last november, mr. darcy!

“perfectly so, thank you.”

“i think understood mr. bingley much idea ever

“i never heard say so; probable may spend

“if means little netherfield, better the

 might possibly get settled family there. but, perhaps, mr. bingley did
 take house much convenience neighbourhood as

“i surprised,” said darcy, “if give as

elizabeth made answer. afraid talking longer his

took hint soon began with, “this seems comfortable
 house. lady catherine, believe, great deal mr.
 collins first came hunsford.”
 
“i believe did--and sure bestowed her

“mr. collins appears fortunate choice wife.”
 
“yes, indeed; friends may well rejoice met one of
 sensible women accepted him, made
 happy had. friend excellent understanding--though
 certain consider marrying mr. collins wisest

 prudential light, certainly good match her.”
 
“it must agreeable settled within easy a

“an easy distance call it? nearly fifty miles.”
 
“and fifty miles good road? little half day’s
 journey. yes, call easy distance.”
 
“i never considered distance one _advantages_

 settled _near_ family.”
 
“it proof attachment hertfordshire. anything beyond

spoke sort smile, elizabeth fancied she
 understood; must supposing thinking jane and

“i mean say woman may settled near her

mr. darcy drew chair little towards her, said, “_you_ cannot

elizabeth looked surprised. gentleman experienced change of

 glancing it, said, colder voice,--

“and able please arrangement, least

“he likes way well,” replied colonel fitzwilliam.
 “but do. better means than

“in opinion, younger earl can know little of

“these home questions--and perhaps say have

“unless like women fortune, think often

“our habits expense make us dependent, many in
 rank life can afford marry without attention to

“is this,” thought elizabeth, “meant me?” coloured the
 idea; but, recovering herself, said lively tone, “and pray, is

 sickly, suppose ask fifty thousand pounds.”
 
answered style, subject dropped. interrupt

“are you, indeed? pray sort guardian make? does

spoke, observed looking earnestly; manner
 immediately asked supposed miss darcy likely to
 give uneasiness, convinced somehow other
 got pretty near truth. directly replied,--
 
“you need frightened. never heard harm her; dare
 say one tractable creatures world. a
 great favourite ladies acquaintance, mrs. hurst and
 miss bingley. think heard say know them.”
 
“i know little. brother pleasant, gentlemanlike
 man--he great friend darcy’s.”
 
“oh yes,” said elizabeth drily--“mr. darcy uncommonly kind mr.
 bingley, takes prodigious deal care him.”
 
“care him! yes, really believe darcy _does_ take care in
 points wants care. something told me

“what mean?”
 
“it circumstance darcy course wish be

“you may depend upon mentioning it.”
 
“and remember much reason supposing be

 imprudent marriage, without mentioning names other

 knowing together whole last summer.”
 
“did mr. darcy give reasons interference?”
 
“i understood strong objections the
 lady.”
 
“and arts use separate them?”
 
“he talk arts,” said fitzwilliam, smiling. “he
 told now told you.”
 
elizabeth made answer, walked on, heart swelling with
 indignation. watching little, fitzwilliam asked she
 thoughtful.
 
“i thinking telling me,” said she. “your
 cousin’s conduct suit feelings. the
 judge?”
 
“you rather disposed call interference officious?”
 
“i see right mr. darcy decide propriety his
 friend’s inclination; why, upon judgment alone, to
 determine direct manner friend happy. but,”
 continued, recollecting herself, “as know none the
 particulars, fair condemn him. supposed
 much affection case.”
 
“that unnatural surmise,” said fitzwilliam; “but is
 lessening honour cousin’s triumph sadly.”
 
spoken jestingly, appeared just picture of
 mr. darcy, trust answer; and,
 therefore, abruptly changing conversation, talked indifferent
 matters till reached parsonage. there, shut room,

 inflicted.
 
“there strong objections lady,” colonel
 fitzwilliam’s words; strong objections probably were, her
 one uncle country attorney, another in
 business london.
 
“to jane herself,” exclaimed, “there possibility of
 objection,--all loveliness goodness is! understanding
 excellent, mind improved, manners captivating. neither could

 peculiarities, abilities mr. darcy need disdain,
 respectability will probably never reach.” thought
 mother, indeed, confidence gave way little; would

 darcy, whose pride, convinced, receive deeper wound from

agitation tears subject occasioned brought a
 headache; grew much worse towards evening that, added to
 unwillingness see mr. darcy, determined attend her

elizabeth eager thanks assurances happiness. had
 spent six weeks great enjoyment; pleasure with
 charlotte, kind attention received, must make _her_ feel

 bought prettier-coloured satin trim fresh, i
 think will tolerable. besides, will much signify what

“are they, indeed?” cried elizabeth, greatest satisfaction.
 
“they going encamped near brighton; want papa to

“yes,” thought elizabeth; “_that_ delightful scheme, indeed,

“and mary king safe!” added elizabeth; “safe connection

“she great fool going away, liked him.”
 
“but hope strong attachment either side,” said jane.
 
“i sure _his_. will answer it, never cared

miss bennet’s astonishment soon lessened strong sisterly
 partiality made admiration elizabeth appear perfectly
 natural; surprise shortly lost feelings. was
 sorry mr. darcy delivered sentiments manner so

 unhappiness sister’s refusal must given him.
 
“his sure succeeding wrong,” said she, “and certainly

“indeed,” replied elizabeth, “i heartily sorry him; has

 blame me, however, refusing him?”
 
“blame you! oh, no.”
 
“but blame spoken warmly wickham?”
 
“no--i know wrong saying did.”

“oh no, regret compassion done away seeing full

“poor wickham! expression goodness his

“there certainly great mismanagement education those

“i never thought mr. darcy deficient _appearance_ you

“and yet meant uncommonly clever taking decided dislike

“lizzy, first read letter, sure treat

“indeed, not. uncomfortable enough, very

“how unfortunate used strong expressions

“certainly. misfortune speaking bitterness most

miss bennet paused little, replied, “surely can no

“that attempted. mr. darcy authorized to

“you quite right. errors made public might ruin for

tumult elizabeth’s mind allayed conversation. she
 got rid two secrets weighed a
 fortnight, certain willing listener jane, whenever she
 might wish talk either. still something
 lurking behind, prudence forbade disclosure. dared not

 elizabeth, conversation carried on. miss darcy looked she

elizabeth soon saw closely watched miss bingley,

 trying talk latter, seated an
 inconvenient distance; sorry spared necessity

 feared, master house might amongst them; whether

 saw suspicions whole party awakened them,

 curiosity strongly marked miss bingley’s, spite the
 smiles overspread face whenever spoke one its

 mr. darcy means over. miss darcy, brother’s
 entrance, exerted much talk; elizabeth saw he
 anxious sister get acquainted, forwarded,
 much possible, every attempt conversation either side. miss
 bingley saw likewise; and, imprudence anger, took the
 first opportunity saying, sneering civility,--
 
“pray, miss eliza, ----shire militia removed meryton?

darcy’s presence dared mention wickham’s name: elizabeth
 instantly comprehended uppermost thoughts; the
 various recollections connected gave moment’s distress;
 but, exerting vigorously repel ill-natured attack, she
 presently answered question tolerably disengaged tone. while
 spoke, involuntary glance showed darcy heightened

 miss bingley, vexed disappointed, dared approach nearer to

 success expected. resolutely silent, however; and, a
 determination making speak, continued,--
 
“i remember, first knew hertfordshire, amazed all

 successively entered world, yet come; mrs.
 bennet, many years lydia’s birth, certain he

 husband’s love independence alone prevented exceeding their
 income.
 
five thousand pounds settled marriage articles mrs. bennet and
 children. proportions divided amongst the
 latter depended will parents. one point, with
 regard lydia least, now settled, mr. bennet
 hesitation acceding proposal him. in

 hundred paid them; for, board pocket

 mother’s hands, lydia’s expenses little within

done trifling exertion side, too, was
 another welcome surprise; chief wish present have
 little trouble business possible. first transports
 rage produced activity seeking over, he
 naturally returned former indolence. letter soon
 despatched; though dilatory undertaking business, quick in
 execution. begged know particulars was
 indebted brother; angry lydia send any
 message her.
 
good news quickly spread house; proportionate
 speed neighbourhood. borne latter decent

 happiest alternative, secluded world distant

 good-natured wishes well-doing, proceeded from
 spiteful old ladies meryton, lost little spirit

 considered certain.
 
fortnight since mrs. bennet stairs, this
 happy day took seat head table, in

 accomplishment, thoughts words ran wholly those
 attendants elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
 servants. busily searching neighbourhood a
 proper situation daughter; and, without knowing considering

“haye park might do,” said she, “if gouldings quit it, the
 great house stoke, drawing-room larger; ashworth is
 far off. bear ten miles me; for
 purvis lodge, attics dreadful.”
 
husband allowed talk without interruption the
 servants remained. withdrawn, said her, “mrs.
 bennet, take any, houses, and
 daughter, let us come right understanding. _one_ house this
 neighbourhood shall never admittance. will encourage the
 imprudence either, receiving longbourn.”
 
long dispute followed declaration; mr. bennet firm: it
 soon led another; mrs. bennet found, amazement horror,
 husband advance guinea buy clothes his

 affection whatever occasion. mrs. bennet hardly comprehend
 it. anger carried point inconceivable
 resentment refuse daughter privilege, without her
 marriage scarcely seem valid, exceeded believe
 possible. alive disgrace, want new

wickham lydia supported tolerable independence she
 imagine. little permanent happiness belong to

mr. gardiner soon wrote brother. mr. bennet’s
 acknowledgments briefly replied, assurances eagerness to

 welcomed rapture; gave hand affectionate smile to
 wickham, followed lady; wished joy, an
 alacrity showed doubt happiness.

 cordial. countenance rather gained austerity; scarcely
 opened lips. easy assurance young couple, indeed, was
 enough provoke him.
 
elizabeth disgusted, even miss bennet shocked. lydia was
 lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, fearless. turned

 length sat down, looked eagerly round room, took notice of

wickham distressed herself; manners
 always pleasing, that, character marriage been

 claimed relationship, delighted all. elizabeth
 believed quite equal assurance; sat
 down, resolving within draw limits future the

“only think three months,” cried, “since went away:

 enough happened time. good gracious! went away, sure
 idea married till came back again! though i
 thought good fun was.”
 
father lifted eyes, jane distressed, elizabeth looked
 expressively lydia; she, never heard saw anything of

“oh, mamma, people hereabouts know married to-day? was
 afraid might not; overtook william goulding curricle,
 determined know it, let side glass

 window frame, might see ring, bowed and

elizabeth bear longer. got ran room;
 returned more, till heard passing hall to

 anxious parade, walk mother’s right hand, hear say to

“ah, jane, take place now, must go lower, a

 wholly free first. ease good
 spirits increased. longed see mrs. philips, lucases, all

“well, mamma,” said she, returned the

“very true; will should. but, dear lydia, don’t

“oh, lord! yes; nothing that. shall like things.

“i like beyond anything!” said mother.
 
“and go away, may leave one two sisters

“i thank share favour,” said elizabeth; “but not
 particularly like way getting husbands.”
 
visitors remain ten days them. mr. wickham
 received commission left london, join
 regiment end fortnight.
 
one mrs. bennet regretted stay short; and
 made time visiting daughter, and
 frequent parties home. parties acceptable to
 all; avoid family circle even desirable did
 think not.
 
wickham’s affection lydia just elizabeth expected to
 find it; equal lydia’s him. scarcely needed her

“mr. darcy!” repeated elizabeth, utter amazement.
 
“oh, yes! come wickham, know. but, gracious me!

“if secret,” said jane, “say another word the

“oh, certainly,” said elizabeth, though burning curiosity; “we will

“not _shall_, though,” added herself, finished the
 letter; “and, dear aunt, tell honourable

mr. wickham perfectly satisfied conversation, he
 never distressed himself, provoked dear sister elizabeth,
 introducing subject it; pleased find she
 said enough keep quiet.
 
day lydia’s departure soon came; mrs. bennet was
 forced submit separation, which, husband means
 entered scheme going newcastle, likely to
 continue least twelvemonth.
 
“oh, dear lydia,” cried, “when shall meet again?”
 
“oh, lord! don’t know. two three years, perhaps.”
 
“write often, dear.”
 
“as often can. know married women never much time for
 writing. sisters may write _me_. will nothing else to
 do.”
 
mr. wickham’s adieus much affectionate wife’s. he
 smiled, looked handsome, said many pretty things.
 
“he fine fellow,” said mr. bennet, soon of
 house, “as ever saw. simpers, smirks, makes love us
 all. prodigiously proud him. defy even sir william lucas
 produce valuable son-in-law.”
 
loss daughter made mrs. bennet dull several days.
 
“i often think,” said she, “that nothing bad parting with
 one’s friends. one seems forlorn without them.”
 
“this consequence, see, madam, marrying daughter,” said
 elizabeth. “it must make better satisfied four are
 single.”
 
“it thing. lydia leave married;
 husband’s regiment happens far off. if
 nearer, gone soon.”
 
spiritless condition event threw shortly
 relieved, mind opened agitation hope, an
 article news began circulation. housekeeper
 netherfield received orders prepare arrival her
 master, coming day two, shoot several
 weeks. mrs. bennet quite fidgets. looked jane, and
 smiled, shook head, turns.
 
“well, well, mr. bingley coming down, sister,” (for mrs.
 philips first brought news). “well, much better. that
 care it, though. nothing us, know, sure i
 never want see again. but, however, welcome come to
 netherfield, likes it. knows _may_ happen? that
 nothing us. know, sister, agreed long ago never mention
 word it. so, quite certain coming?”
 
“you may depend it,” replied other, “for mrs. nichols in
 meryton last night: saw passing by, went purpose
 know truth it; told certainly true. he
 comes thursday, latest, likely wednesday. was
 going butcher’s, told me, purpose order meat on
 wednesday, got three couple ducks just fit killed.”
 
miss bennet able hear coming without changing
 colour. many months since mentioned name to
 elizabeth; now, soon alone together, said,--
 
“i saw look to-day, lizzy, aunt told us present
 report; know appeared distressed; don’t imagine from
 silly cause. confused moment, felt that
 _should_ looked at. assure news affect
 either pleasure pain. glad one thing, comes
 alone; shall see less him. afraid of
 _myself_, dread people’s remarks.”
 
elizabeth know make it. seen in
 derbyshire, might supposed capable coming no
 view acknowledged; still thought partial
 jane, wavered greater probability coming
 _with_ friend’s permission, bold enough come
 without it.
 
“yet hard,” sometimes thought, “that poor man come
 house, legally hired, without raising this
 speculation! _will_ leave himself.”
 
spite sister declared, really believed her
 feelings, expectation arrival, elizabeth easily
 perceive spirits affected it. disturbed,
 unequal, often seen them.
 
subject warmly canvassed parents,
 twelvemonth ago, now brought forward again.
 
“as soon ever mr. bingley comes, dear,” said mrs. bennet, “you
 will wait him, course.”
 
“no, no. forced visiting last year, promised, i
 went see him, marry one daughters. ended in
 nothing, will sent fool’s errand again.”
 
wife represented absolutely necessary attention
 neighbouring gentlemen, returning to
 netherfield.
 
“’tis _etiquette_ despise,” said he. “if wants society, let
 seek it. knows live. will spend _my_ hours in
 running neighbours every time go away come back
 again.”
 
“well, know is, will abominably rude wait
 him. but, however, shan’t prevent asking dine here, i
 determined. must mrs. long gouldings soon. will
 make thirteen ourselves, will just room table for
 him.”
 
consoled resolution, better able bear her
 husband’s incivility; though mortifying know her
 neighbours might see mr. bingley, consequence it, before
 _they_ did. day arrival drew near,--
 
“i begin sorry comes all,” said jane sister. “it
 nothing; see perfect indifference; can
 hardly bear hear thus perpetually talked of. mother means well;
 know, one can know, much suffer she
 says. happy shall stay netherfield over!”
 
“i wish say anything comfort you,” replied elizabeth; “but it
 wholly power. must feel it; usual satisfaction
 preaching patience sufferer denied me, have
 always much.”
 
mr. bingley arrived. mrs. bennet, assistance servants,
 contrived earliest tidings it, period anxiety
 fretfulness side long could. counted days
 must intervene invitation sent--hopeless of
 seeing before. third morning arrival in
 hertfordshire, saw dressing-room window enter the
 paddock, ride towards house.
 
daughters eagerly called partake joy. jane resolutely
 kept place table; elizabeth, satisfy mother, went
 window--she looked--she saw mr. darcy him, sat down
 sister.
 
“there gentleman him, mamma,” said kitty; “who can be?”
 
“some acquaintance other, dear, suppose; sure not
 know.”
 
“la!” replied kitty, “it looks just like man used with
 before. mr. what’s name--that tall, proud man.”
 
“good gracious! mr. darcy!--and does, vow. well, friend of
 mr. bingley’s will always welcome here, sure; else must
 say hate sight him.”
 
jane looked elizabeth surprise concern. knew little
 meeting derbyshire, therefore felt awkwardness
 must attend sister, seeing almost first time
 receiving explanatory letter. sisters uncomfortable
 enough. felt other, course themselves; their
 mother talked dislike mr. darcy, resolution be
 civil mr. bingley’s friend, without heard either
 them. elizabeth sources uneasiness yet be
 suspected jane, never yet courage show mrs.
 gardiner’s letter, relate change sentiment towards
 him. jane, man whose proposals refused,
 whose merits undervalued; extensive
 information, person whole family indebted
 first benefits, regarded an
 interest, quite tender, least reasonable just, as
 jane felt bingley. astonishment coming--at his
 coming netherfield, longbourn, voluntarily seeking again,
 almost equal known first witnessing altered
 behaviour derbyshire.
 
colour driven face returned half a
 minute additional glow, smile delight added lustre to
 eyes, thought space time affection and
 wishes must still unshaken; secure.
 
“let first see behaves,” said she; “it will early
 enough expectation.”
 
sat intently work, striving composed, without daring to
 lift eyes, till anxious curiosity carried face her
 sister servant approaching door. jane looked little
 paler usual, sedate elizabeth expected. the
 gentlemen’s appearing, colour increased; yet received with
 tolerable ease, propriety behaviour equally free any
 symptom resentment, unnecessary complaisance.
 
elizabeth said little either civility allow, sat down
 work, eagerness often command. she
 ventured one glance darcy. looked serious usual; and,
 thought, used look hertfordshire, as
 seen pemberley. but, perhaps, her
 mother’s presence uncle aunt. a
 painful, improbable, conjecture.
 
bingley likewise seen instant, short period
 saw looking pleased embarrassed. received mrs.
 bennet degree civility made two daughters ashamed,
 especially contrasted cold ceremonious politeness of
 courtesy address friend.
 
elizabeth particularly, knew mother owed latter the
 preservation favourite daughter irremediable infamy, was
 hurt distressed painful degree distinction ill
 applied.
 
darcy, inquiring mr. mrs. gardiner did--a question
 answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. he
 seated her: perhaps reason silence; but
 derbyshire. talked friends
 herself. now several minutes elapsed, without
 bringing sound voice; occasionally, unable resist
 impulse curiosity, raised eyes face, often
 found looking jane herself, frequently object but
 ground. thoughtfulness less anxiety please, when
 last met, plainly expressed. disappointed, angry
 so.
 
“could expect otherwise?” said she. “yet come?”
 
humour conversation anyone himself; to
 hardly courage speak.
 
inquired sister, more.
 
“it long time, mr. bingley, since went away,” said mrs. bennet.
 
readily agreed it.
 
“i began afraid never come back again. people _did_ say,
 meant quit place entirely michaelmas; but, however, hope
 true. great many changes happened neighbourhood
 since went away. miss lucas married settled: one my
 daughters. suppose heard it; indeed, must have

bingley replied did, made congratulations. elizabeth
 dared lift eyes. mr. darcy looked, therefore, could
 tell.
 
“it delightful thing, sure, daughter well married,”
 continued mother; “but time, mr. bingley, very
 hard taken away me. gone newcastle, a
 place quite northward seems, stay, not
 know long. regiment there; suppose heard of
 leaving ----shire, gone regulars.
 thank heaven! _some_ friends, though, perhaps, many he
 deserves.”
 
elizabeth, knew levelled mr. darcy, misery
 shame hardly keep seat. drew her, however,
 exertion speaking, nothing else effectually done
 before; asked bingley whether meant make stay the
 country present. weeks, believed.
 
“when killed birds, mr. bingley,” said mother,
 “i beg will come shoot many please mr.
 bennet’s manor. sure will vastly happy oblige you, and
 will save best coveys you.”
 
elizabeth’s misery increased unnecessary, officious
 attention! fair prospect arise present, had
 flattered year ago, everything, persuaded, be
 hastening vexatious conclusion. instant felt,
 years happiness make jane amends for
 moments painful confusion.
 
“the first wish heart,” said herself, “is never be
 company either them. society can afford pleasure
 will atone wretchedness this! let never see either
 one again!”
 
yet misery, years happiness offer no
 compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, observing
 much beauty sister rekindled admiration former
 lover. first came in, spoken little, every
 five minutes seemed giving attention. found her
 handsome last year; good-natured, as
 unaffected, though quite chatty. jane anxious no
 difference perceived all, really persuaded
 talked much ever; mind busily engaged,
 always know silent.
 
gentlemen rose go away, mrs. bennet mindful her
 intended civility, invited engaged dine at
 longbourn days’ time.
 
“you quite visit debt, mr. bingley,” added; “for when
 went town last winter, promised take family dinner with
 us soon returned. forgot, see; assure you
 much disappointed come back keep your
 engagement.”
 
bingley looked little silly reflection, said something of
 concern prevented business. went away.
 
mrs. bennet strongly inclined ask stay dine
 day; but, though always kept good table, did
 think anything less two courses good enough man
 anxious designs, satisfy appetite pride

soon gone, elizabeth walked recover spirits;
 or, words, dwell without interruption subjects
 must deaden more. mr. darcy’s behaviour astonished vexed
 her.
 
“why, came silent, grave, indifferent,” said she,
 “did come all?”
 
settle way gave pleasure.
 
“he still amiable, still pleasing uncle aunt, he

 longer cares me, silent? teasing, teasing man! will think
 him.”
 
resolution short time involuntarily kept approach
 sister, joined cheerful look showed her
 better satisfied visitors elizabeth.
 
“now,” said she, “that first meeting over, feel perfectly
 easy. know strength, shall never embarrassed by
 coming. glad dines tuesday. will publicly
 seen, sides meet common indifferent
 acquaintance.”
 
“yes, indifferent, indeed,” said elizabeth, laughingly. “oh, jane!
 take care.”
 
“my dear lizzy, think weak danger now.”
 
“i think great danger making much love with
 ever.”
 
see gentlemen till tuesday; mrs. bennet, in
 meanwhile, giving way happy schemes the
 good-humour common politeness bingley, half hour’s visit,
 revived.
 
tuesday large party assembled longbourn; two
 anxiously expected, credit punctuality as
 sportsmen, good time. repaired the
 dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched see whether bingley take
 place which, former parties, belonged him, by
 sister. prudent mother, occupied ideas, forbore to
 invite sit herself. entering room, seemed to
 hesitate; jane happened look round, happened smile: was
 decided. placed her.
 
elizabeth, triumphant sensation, looked towards friend. he
 bore noble indifference; imagined that
 bingley received sanction happy, seen eyes
 likewise turned towards mr. darcy, expression half-laughing
 alarm.
 
behaviour sister dinnertime showed an
 admiration her, which, though guarded formerly, persuaded
 elizabeth, that, left wholly himself, jane’s happiness, his
 own, speedily secured. though dared depend upon the
 consequence, yet received pleasure observing behaviour. it
 gave animation spirits boast; in
 cheerful humour. mr. darcy almost far table

 would, times, given anything privileged tell
 him, kindness neither unknown unfelt whole of
 family.
 
hopes evening afford opportunity of
 bringing together; whole visit pass away
 without enabling enter something conversation,
 mere ceremonious salutation attending entrance. anxious and
 uneasy, period passed drawing-room gentlemen
 came, wearisome dull degree almost made uncivil.
 looked forward entrance point her
 chance pleasure evening must depend.
 
“if come me, _then_,” said she, “i shall give for
 ever.”
 
gentlemen came; thought looked have
 answered hopes; but, alas! ladies crowded round table,
 miss bennet making tea, elizabeth pouring coffee,
 close confederacy, single vacancy near her
 admit chair. gentlemen’s approaching, one of
 girls moved closer ever, said, whisper,--
 
“the men shan’t come part us, determined. want none them;
 we?”
 
darcy walked away another part room. followed with
 eyes, envied everyone spoke, scarcely patience enough
 help anybody coffee, enraged for
 silly!
 
“a man refused! ever foolish enough to
 expect renewal love? one among sex not

 indignity abhorrent feelings.”
 
little revived, however, bringing back coffee-cup
 himself; seized opportunity saying,--
 
“is sister pemberley still?”
 
“yes; will remain till christmas.”
 
“and quite alone? friends left her?”
 
“mrs. annesley her. others gone scarborough

think nothing say; wished converse
 her, might better success. stood her, however, for
 minutes, silence; and, last, young lady’s whispering
 elizabeth again, walked away.
 
tea things removed, card tables placed, ladies
 rose; elizabeth hoping soon joined him, when
 views overthrown, seeing fall victim her
 mother’s rapacity whist players, moments seated

 confined evening different tables; had
 nothing hope, eyes often turned towards side
 room, make play unsuccessfully herself.
 
mrs. bennet designed keep two netherfield gentlemen to
 supper; carriage was, unluckily, ordered the
 others, opportunity detaining them.
 
“well, girls,” said she, soon left themselves, “what
 say day? think everything passed uncommonly well, i
 assure you. dinner well dressed ever saw. the
 venison roasted turn--and everybody said, never saw fat
 haunch. soup fifty times better the
 lucases’ last week; even mr. darcy acknowledged partridges

 cooks least. and, dear jane, never saw look greater
 beauty. mrs. long said too, asked whether not. and
 think said besides? ‘ah! mrs. bennet, shall her

 good creature ever lived--and nieces pretty behaved

mrs. bennet, short, great spirits: seen enough of
 bingley’s behaviour jane convinced get at

 humour, far beyond reason, quite disappointed at
 seeing next day, make proposals.
 
“it agreeable day,” said miss bennet elizabeth. “the
 party seemed well selected, suitable one other. hope we
 may often meet again.”
 
elizabeth smiled.
 
“lizzy, must so. must suspect me. mortifies me. i

“how hard cases believed! impossible in

“can come to-morrow?”
 
yes, engagement to-morrow; invitation was

 impression them. elizabeth observe her; last
 kitty did, innocently said, “what matter, mamma? do
 keep winking for? do?”
 
“nothing, child, nothing. wink you.” sat still
 five minutes longer; unable waste precious occasion, she
 suddenly got up, saying kitty,--
 
“come here, love, want speak you,” took room.
 jane instantly gave look elizabeth spoke distress such

bingley punctual appointment; mr. bennet spent the

jane reserves elizabeth, confidence give

“’tis much!” added, “by far much. deserve it. oh,

“and this,” said she, “is end friend’s anxious

“where sister?” said hastily, opened door.
 
“with mother upstairs. will moment, dare say.”

“tell me, all, engaged him?”
 
though elizabeth not, mere purpose obliging lady
 catherine, answered question, say, a

“i not.”
 
lady catherine seemed pleased.
 
“and will promise never enter engagement?”
 
“i will make promise kind.”

discomposure spirits extraordinary visit threw
 elizabeth easily overcome; many
 hours learn think less incessantly. lady catherine, it
 appeared, actually taken trouble journey rosings

 till recollected _his_ intimate friend bingley,
 _her_ sister jane, enough, time the

 sister must bring frequently together. neighbours at
 lucas lodge, therefore, (for communication the
 collinses, report, concluded, reached lady catherine,) had
 set _that_ almost certain immediate _she_ had
 looked forward possible future time.
 
revolving lady catherine’s expressions, however, help
 feeling uneasiness possible consequence persisting

 prevent marriage, occurred elizabeth must meditate an

 thought much higher ladyship _she_ do; it
 certain, enumerating miseries marriage _one_

 catherine might see way town; engagement to

“if, therefore, excuse keeping promise come his

 all.”
 
surprise rest family, hearing visitor had
 been, great: obligingly satisfied same
 kind supposition appeased mrs. bennet’s curiosity; and
 elizabeth spared much teasing subject.
 
next morning, going stairs, met her
 father, came library letter hand.
 
“lizzy,” said he, “i going look you: come room.”
 
followed thither; curiosity know tell

followed father fireplace, sat down. he
 said,--
 
“i received letter morning astonished me
 exceedingly. principally concerns yourself, know its
 contents. know _two_ daughters brink

colour now rushed elizabeth’s cheeks instantaneous

 undetermined whether pleased explained
 all, offended letter rather addressed to

“you look conscious. young ladies great penetration matters

“from mr. collins! can _he_ say?”
 
“something much purpose, course. begins with

 ‘this young gentleman blessed, peculiar way, everything the

elizabeth tried join father’s pleasantry, force
 one reluctant smile. never wit directed manner so
 little agreeable her.
 
“are diverted?”
 
“oh, yes. pray read on.”
 
“‘after mentioning likelihood marriage ladyship last

“oh,” cried elizabeth, “i exceedingly diverted. so

“yes, _that_ makes amusing. fixed man

question daughter replied laugh; had
 asked without least suspicion, distressed his

 rather cried. father cruelly mortified by

 wonder want penetration, fear that, perhaps, instead of

instead receiving letter excuse friend, as
 elizabeth half expected mr. bingley do, able bring darcy

 visit. gentlemen arrived early; and, mrs. bennet time to
 tell seen aunt, daughter sat in
 momentary dread, bingley, wanted alone jane, proposed
 walking out. agreed to. mrs. bennet the
 habit walking, mary never spare time, remaining five
 set together. bingley jane, however, soon allowed others to
 outstrip them. lagged behind, elizabeth, kitty, darcy
 entertain other. little said either; kitty was
 much afraid talk; elizabeth secretly forming a
 desperate resolution; and, perhaps, might same.
 
walked towards lucases’, kitty wished call upon
 maria; elizabeth saw occasion making general concern,
 kitty left went boldly alone. now the
 moment resolution executed; courage was
 high, immediately said,--
 
“mr. darcy, selfish creature, sake giving
 relief feelings care much may wounding yours. i
 can longer help thanking unexampled kindness poor
 sister. ever since known anxious to
 acknowledge gratefully feel it. known rest
 family merely gratitude express.”
 
“i sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied darcy, tone surprise
 emotion, “that ever informed may, a
 mistaken light, given uneasiness. think mrs. gardiner
 little trusted.”
 
“you must blame aunt. lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
 concerned matter; and, course, could
 rest till knew particulars. let thank again,
 name family, generous compassion induced

 sake discovering them.”
 
“if _will_ thank me,” replied, “let alone.
 wish giving happiness might add force other
 inducements led on, shall attempt deny. your

 _you_.”
 
elizabeth much embarrassed say word. short pause,
 companion added, “you generous trifle me. your
 feelings still last april, tell once. _my_
 affections wishes unchanged; one word will silence
 subject ever.”
 
elizabeth, feeling common awkwardness anxiety of
 situation, now forced speak; immediately, though not
 fluently, gave understand sentiments undergone
 material change since period alluded, make
 receive gratitude pleasure present assurances. the
 happiness reply produced probably never
 felt before; expressed occasion sensibly as
 warmly man violently love can supposed do. elizabeth
 able encounter eyes, might seen well the

 though look listen; told feelings
 which, proving importance him, made affection

“it taught hope,” said he, “as scarcely ever allowed myself
 hope before. knew enough disposition certain, that

 acknowledged lady catherine frankly openly.”
 
elizabeth coloured laughed replied, “yes, know enough of

 abominably face, scruple abusing all

“what say deserve? though your
 accusations ill-founded, formed mistaken premises, behaviour

 unpardonable. think without abhorrence.”
 
“we will quarrel greater share blame annexed that
 evening,” said elizabeth. “the conduct neither, strictly
 examined, will irreproachable; since both, hope,

“i easily reconciled myself. recollection i

“i can easily believe it. thought devoid every proper

“oh, repeat said. recollections will at

darcy mentioned letter. “did it,” said he,--“did _soon_ make you

explained effects been, gradually all
 former prejudices removed.
 
“i knew,” said he, “that wrote must give pain, was

“the letter shall certainly burnt, believe essential the

“when wrote letter,” replied darcy, “i believed perfectly

“the letter, perhaps, began bitterness, end so. the

“you know nothing matter. _that_ forgot. perhaps i
 always love well now; cases these

miss bennet still looked amazement. elizabeth again, more
 seriously, assured truth.
 
“good heaven! can really so? yet now must believe you,” cried
 jane. “my dear, dear lizzy, would, congratulate you; you

“there can doubt that. settled us already we

“very, much. nothing give either bingley more

“oh, yes! will think feel _more_ i

“my dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. want talk seriously.

“it coming gradually, hardly know began;

another entreaty serious, however, produced the
 desired effect; soon satisfied jane solemn assurances of

elizabeth told motives secrecy. unwilling to

 half night spent conversation.
 
“good gracious!” cried mrs. bennet, stood window next
 morning, “if disagreeable mr. darcy coming with

 coming here? notion go a-shooting, something or
 other, disturb us company. shall him?
 lizzy, must walk again, may bingley’s
 way.”
 
elizabeth hardly help laughing convenient proposal; yet
 really vexed mother always giving an
 epithet.
 
soon entered, bingley looked expressively, and
 shook hands warmth, left doubt good information;
 soon afterwards said aloud, “mrs. bennet, lanes
 hereabouts lizzy may lose way to-day?”
 
“i advise mr. darcy, lizzy, kitty,” said mrs. bennet, “to walk
 oakham mount morning. nice long walk, mr. darcy has
 never seen view.”
 
“it may well others,” replied mr. bingley; “but am
 sure will much kitty. won’t it, kitty?”
 
kitty owned rather stay home. darcy professed great
 curiosity see view mount, elizabeth silently
 consented. went upstairs get ready, mrs. bennet followed her,
 saying,--
 
“i quite sorry, lizzy, forced that
 disagreeable man yourself; hope will mind it. is
 jane’s sake, know; occasion talking to

evening, soon mr. bennet withdrew library, saw
 mr. darcy rise also follow him, agitation seeing was

father walking room, looking grave anxious.

“have objection,” said elizabeth, “than belief my

“none all. know proud, unpleasant sort man; but
 nothing really liked him.”
 
“i do, like him,” replied, tears eyes; “i love him.

“lizzy,” said father, “i given consent. kind

elizabeth, still affected, earnest solemn reply;
 and, length, repeated assurances mr. darcy really the
 object choice, explaining gradual change her
 estimation undergone, relating absolute certainty that

 months’ suspense, enumerating energy good qualities,

“well, dear,” said he, ceased speaking, “i to

“this evening wonders, indeed! so, darcy everything;

recollected embarrassment days reading
 mr. collins’s letter; laughing time, allowed her
 last go, saying, quitted room, “if young men come
 mary kitty, send in, quite leisure.”
 
elizabeth’s mind now relieved heavy weight; and, after
 half hour’s quiet reflection room, able join
 others tolerable composure. everything recent for
 gaiety, evening passed tranquilly away; longer
 anything material dreaded, comfort ease familiarity
 come time.
 
mother went dressing-room night, followed her,
 made important communication. effect extraordinary;
 for, first hearing it, mrs. bennet sat quite still, unable to
 utter syllable. many, many minutes, could
 comprehend heard, though general backward credit what
 advantage family, came shape a
 lover them. began length recover, fidget in
 chair, get up, sit again, wonder, bless herself.
 
“good gracious! lord bless me! think! dear me! mr. darcy! would

enough prove approbation need doubted; and
 elizabeth, rejoicing effusion heard herself,
 soon went away. three minutes room,
 mother followed her.
 
“my dearest child,” cried, “i can think nothing else. ten
 thousand year, likely more! ’tis good lord! a
 special licence--you must shall married special licence.
 but, dearest love, tell dish mr. darcy particularly fond
 of, may to-morrow.”
 
sad omen mother’s behaviour gentleman
 might be; elizabeth found that, though certain
 possession warmest affection, secure relations’
 consent, still something wished for. morrow
 passed much better expected; mrs. bennet luckily stood
 awe intended son-in-law, ventured speak
 him, unless power offer attention, mark
 deference opinion.
 
elizabeth satisfaction seeing father taking pains get
 acquainted him; mr. bennet soon assured rising
 every hour esteem.
 
“i admire three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “wickham, perhaps,
 favourite; think shall like _your_ husband quite well

_walt whitman somewhere fine just distinction “loving
 allowance” “loving personal love.” distinction applies
 books well men women; case very
 numerous authors objects personal affection, it
 brings curious consequence it. much difference as
 best work case others loved “by
 allowance” convention, felt right and
 proper thing love them. sect--fairly large yet
 unusually choice--of austenians janites, probably be
 found partisans claim primacy almost every one the
 novels. delightful freshness humour of_ northanger
 abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure undoubted
 critical facts scale small, scheme, all, that
 burlesque parody, kind first rank reached with
 difficulty._ persuasion, _relatively faint tone, enthralling
 interest, devotees exalt others exquisite
 delicacy keeping. catastrophe of_ mansfield park _is admittedly
 theatrical, hero heroine insipid, author almost
 wickedly destroyed romantic interest expressly admitting that
 edmund took fanny mary shocked him, fanny might
 likely taken crawford little assiduous;
 yet matchless rehearsal-scenes characters mrs. norris and
 others secured, believe, considerable party it._ sense and
 sensibility _has perhaps fewest out-and-out admirers; does
 want them._
 
_i suppose, however, majority least competent votes
 would, things considered, divided between_ emma _and present
 book; perhaps vulgar verdict (if indeed fondness miss
 austen patent exemption possible charge
 vulgarity) go for_ emma. _it larger, varied, the
 popular; author time composition seen rather

 peculiar characteristic dialogue; figures miss bates, the
 eltons, unite suffrages everybody. hand,

 seems perfect, characteristic, most
 eminently quintessential author’s works; contention
 narrow space permitted me, propose show
 cause._
 
_in first place, book (it may barely necessary remind the
 reader) first shape written early, somewhere 1796,
 miss austen barely twenty-one; though revised and
 finished chawton fifteen years later, published till
 1813, four years death. know whether, this
 combination fresh vigorous projection youth, the
 critical revision middle life, may traced distinct
 superiority point construction, which, seems me, it
 possesses others. plot, though elaborate, almost
 regular enough fielding; hardly character, hardly incident

 théâtre; _it connects strictest way course the
 story earlier, brings denouement complete propriety.
 minor passages--the loves jane bingley, advent mr.
 collins, visit hunsford, derbyshire tour--fit the
 unostentatious, masterly fashion. attempt the
 hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, transactions between

 intrigue of_ emma, _but contributes fashion think
 best feature otherwise admirable book. although miss austen
 always liked something misunderstanding kind, afforded her
 opportunities display peculiar incomparable talent to

 natural occasions provided false account darcy’s conduct given
 wickham, awkwardness (arising equal naturalness) from
 gradual transformation elizabeth’s feelings positive
 aversion actual love. know whether all-grasping hand of
 playwright ever laid upon_ pride prejudice; _and dare
 say that, were, situations prove startling or
 garish enough footlights, character-scheme subtle and
 delicate pit gallery. attempt made, would
 certainly hampered loosenesses construction,
 which, sometimes disguised conveniences novelist can
 avail himself, appear stage._
 
_i think, however, though thought will doubtless seem heretical to
 one school critics, construction highest
 merit, choicest gift, novelist. sets gifts

 will sometimes mar graces--appreciably, though quite
 consciously--to eyes means ultra-critical. badly-built

 displayed consummate command dialogue--perhaps rarest all
 faculties--would infinitely better thing faultless plot

 thorpe, eltons, mrs. norris, one two others company,

_the characteristics miss austen’s humour subtle delicate
 are, perhaps, times easier apprehend to
 express, particular time likely differently
 apprehended different persons. humour seems possess a
 greater affinity, whole, addison of
 numerous species great british genus. differences of
 scheme, time, subject, literary convention, are, course,
 obvious enough; difference sex not, perhaps, count much,
 distinctly feminine element “mr. spectator,” in
 jane austen’s genius was, though nothing mannish, much was
 masculine. likeness quality consists great number of

 savagery swift, mildness miss austen boisterousness

 immediate predecessor, miss burney, allowed without much
 protest. yet, mr. addison miss austen is, though a
 restrained well-mannered, insatiable ruthless delight in
 roasting cutting fool. man early eighteenth century,

 written rather ladylike intelligent lydia bennet the
 days lydia’s great-grandmother; while, hand, (i
 think unreasonably) found “cynicism” touches miss austen’s
 own, satire mrs. musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over
 son. word “cynical” one misused the
 english language, especially when, glaring gratuitous
 falsification original sense, applied, rough and
 snarling invective, gentle oblique satire. cynicism means
 perception “the side,” sense “the accepted hells
 beneath,” consciousness motives nearly always mixed, and
 seem identical be--if cynicism, then
 every man woman fool, care live a
 fool’s paradise, knowledge nature world life, is
 cynic. sense miss austen certainly one. may even
 one sense that, like mr. bennet, she
 took epicurean delight dissecting, displaying, setting at
 work fools mean persons. think take delight,
 think worse woman, she
 immensely better artist._
 
_in respect art generally, mr. goldwin smith truly observed
 “metaphor exhausted depicting perfection it,
 combined narrowness field;” justly added that

 term miniature restricted sense, must think rather memling

 gravest fears, studies, ways, conduct were

 mary wollstonecraft protested better general sense particular
 taste judgment. miss austen, too, drew back white frost

 even black one._
 
_for knowledge extended, knew two things which
 genius knows. one humanity, art. the

 myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build picture like magic.
 nothing false; nothing superfluous. (to take present book
 only) mr. collins changed mind jane elizabeth “while mrs.
 bennet stirring fire” (and know_ _mrs. bennet have
 stirred fire), mr. darcy “brought coffee-cup back_
 himself,” _the touch case like swift--“taller the
 breadth nail”--which impressed half-reluctant thackeray with
 just outspoken admiration. indeed, fantastic may seem, i
 put miss austen near swift ways, put her
 addison others._
 
_this swiftian quality appears present novel appears
 nowhere else character immortal, ineffable mr.

 humanity, philistinism, well-meaning hide-bound morality,

 selfishness, receives exhibition. will admit one speech

_but greatness mr. collins satisfactorily

 perhaps, faint shade colour charge; seems me
 faint indeed. even now think impossible

 developing agreeable characteristics seldom present

 readers pleasant shocks, delightful thrills, felt by
 readers swift, fielding, may add, thackeray, as
 felt readers english author fiction

_the goodness minor characters in_ pride prejudice _has been
 already alluded to, makes detailed dwelling beauties

 glanced at, easy say whether exquisitely

 respect peculiar kind; doubtless), one regards mr.
 collins, draws moral lydia’s fall. sometimes wish

_the bingleys gardiners lucases, miss darcy miss de
 bourgh, jane, wickham, rest, must pass without special comment,
 remark charlotte lucas (her egregious papa, though
 delightful, just little thither side line between
 comedy farce) wonderfully clever study drab one kind, and
 wickham (though something miss austen’s hesitation touch in
 dealing young men appears) much less notable sketch in
 drab another. genius made charlotte is, yet
 disagreeable; wickham is, without investing either with
 cheap don juanish attractiveness disgusting rascality. the
 hero heroine tints dismissed._
 
_darcy always seemed far best interesting of
 miss austen’s heroes; possible competitor henry tilney,
 whose part slight simple hardly enters into
 comparison. sometimes, believe, urged pride is

_the secret charm many men women, miss austen

“how so? can affect them?”
 
“my dear mr. bennet,” replied wife, “how can tiresome? you

“is design settling here?”
 
“design? nonsense, can talk so! likely he

“i see occasion that. girls may go--or may send

“my dear, flatter me. certainly _have_ share beauty, but

mr. bennet among earliest waited mr. bingley. he
 always intended visit him, though last always assuring his
 wife go; till evening visit was
 paid knowledge it. disclosed following
 manner. observing second daughter employed trimming hat, he
 suddenly addressed with,--
 
“i hope mr. bingley will like it, lizzy.”
 
“we way know _what_ mr. bingley likes,” said mother,
 resentfully, “since visit.”
 
“but forget, mamma,” said elizabeth, “that shall meet the
 assemblies, mrs. long promised introduce him.”
 
“i believe mrs. long will thing. two nieces
 own. selfish, hypocritical woman, opinion
 her.”
 
“no i,” said mr. bennet; “and glad find do
 depend serving you.”
 
mrs. bennet deigned make reply; but, unable contain
 herself, began scolding one daughters.
 
“don’t keep coughing so, kitty, heaven’s sake! little
 compassion nerves. tear pieces.”
 
“kitty discretion coughs,” said father; “she times
 ill.”
 
“i cough amusement,” replied kitty, fretfully. “when
 next ball be, lizzy?”
 
“to-morrow fortnight.”
 
“ay, is,” cried mother, “and mrs. long come back till
 day before; so, will impossible introduce him, for
 will know herself.”
 
“then, dear, may advantage friend, introduce
 mr. bingley _her_.”
 
“impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, acquainted him
 myself; can teasing?”
 
“i honour circumspection. fortnight’s acquaintance certainly
 little. one know man really end a
 fortnight. _we_ venture, somebody else will; after
 all, mrs. long nieces must stand chance; and, therefore,
 will think act kindness, decline office, i
 will take myself.”
 
girls stared father. mrs. bennet said only, “nonsense,
 nonsense!”
 
“what can meaning emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “do
 consider forms introduction, stress laid on
 them, nonsense? quite agree _there_. say you,
 mary? young lady deep reflection, know, read
 great books, make extracts.”
 
mary wished say something sensible, knew how.
 
“while mary adjusting ideas,” continued, “let us return mr.
 bingley.”
 
“i sick mr. bingley,” cried wife.
 
“i sorry hear _that_; tell before? i
 known much morning, certainly called on
 him. unlucky; actually paid visit, we
 escape acquaintance now.”
 
astonishment ladies just wished--that mrs.
 bennet perhaps surpassing rest; though first tumult joy
 over, began declare expected the
 while.
 
“how good you, dear mr. bennet! knew should
 persuade last. sure loved girls well to
 neglect acquaintance. well, pleased am! a
 good joke, too, gone morning, never said a
 word till now.”
 
“now, kitty, may cough much choose,” said mr. bennet; and,
 spoke, left room, fatigued raptures wife.
 
“what excellent father have, girls,” said she, door was
 shut. “i know will ever make amends kindness;
 either, matter. time life, so
 pleasant, can tell you, making new acquaintances every day; but
 sakes anything. lydia, love, though _are_
 youngest, dare say mr. bingley will dance next
 ball.”
 
“oh,” said lydia, stoutly, “i afraid; though _am_ the
 youngest, i’m tallest.”
 
rest evening spent conjecturing soon would

jane elizabeth alone, former, cautious in
 praise mr. bingley before, expressed sister much
 admired him.
 
“he just young-man be,” said she, “sensible,
 good-humoured, lively; never saw happy manners! much ease,
 perfect good breeding!”
 
“he also handsome,” replied elizabeth, “which young man ought

“i much flattered asking dance second time. i
 expect compliment.”
 
“did you? _i_ you. one great difference between

“dear lizzy!”
 
“oh, great deal apt, know, like people general.

“i wish hasty censuring anyone; always speak

“i know do: _that_ makes wonder. _your_

 too, you? manners equal his.”
 
“certainly not, first; pleasing women you
 converse them. miss bingley live brother, keep

elizabeth listened silence, convinced: behaviour at

“then drink great deal ought,” said mrs.

five o’clock two ladies retired dress, half-past six
 elizabeth summoned dinner. civil inquiries then
 poured in, amongst pleasure distinguishing the
 much superior solicitude mr. bingley, make very
 favourable answer. jane means better. sisters, hearing
 this, repeated three four times much grieved, how
 shocking bad cold, excessively disliked
 ill themselves; thought matter: their
 indifference towards jane, immediately them, restored
 elizabeth enjoyment original dislike.
 
brother, indeed, one party could
 regard complacency. anxiety jane evident, his
 attentions pleasing; prevented feeling
 much intruder believed considered the
 others. little notice him. miss bingley was
 engrossed mr. darcy, sister scarcely less so; mr.
 hurst, elizabeth sat, indolent man, lived to
 eat, drink, play cards, who, found prefer plain
 dish ragout, nothing say her.
 
dinner over, returned directly jane, miss bingley
 began abusing soon room. manners were
 pronounced bad indeed,--a mixture pride impertinence:
 conversation, style, taste, beauty. mrs. hurst
 thought same, added,--
 
“she nothing, short, recommend her, excellent
 walker. shall never forget appearance morning. really
 looked almost wild.”
 
“she indeed, louisa. hardly keep countenance. very
 nonsensical come all! must _she_ scampering the
 country, sister cold? hair untidy, blowzy!”
 
“yes, petticoat; hope saw petticoat, six inches deep
 mud, absolutely certain, gown let to
 hide office.”
 
“your picture may exact, louisa,” said bingley; “but was
 lost upon me. thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well
 came room morning. dirty petticoat quite
 escaped notice.”
 
“_you_ observed it, mr. darcy, sure,” said miss bingley; “and am
 inclined think wish see _your sister_ make such
 exhibition.”
 
“certainly not.”
 
“to walk three miles, four miles, five miles, whatever is,
 ancles dirt, alone, quite alone! mean by
 it? seems show abominable sort conceited independence,
 country-town indifference decorum.”
 
“it shows affection sister pleasing,” said
 bingley.
 
“i afraid, mr. darcy,” observed miss bingley, half whisper,
 “that adventure rather affected admiration fine
 eyes.”
 
“not all,” replied: “they brightened exercise.” a
 short pause followed speech, mrs. hurst began again,--
 
“i excessive regard jane bennet,--she really sweet
 girl,--and wish heart well settled. such
 father mother, low connections, afraid no
 chance it.”
 
“i think heard say uncle attorney in
 meryton?”
 
“yes; another, lives somewhere near cheapside.”
 
“that capital,” added sister; laughed heartily.
 
“if uncles enough fill _all_ cheapside,” cried bingley, “it
 make one jot less agreeable.”
 
“but must materially lessen chance marrying men any
 consideration world,” replied darcy.
 
speech bingley made answer; sisters gave their
 hearty assent, indulged mirth time expense of
 dear friend’s vulgar relations.
 
renewal tenderness, however, repaired room on
 leaving dining-parlour, sat till summoned coffee.
 still poorly, elizabeth quit all, till
 late evening, comfort seeing asleep, and
 appeared rather right pleasant go
 stairs herself. entering drawing-room, found whole
 party loo, immediately invited join them; suspecting
 playing high, declined it, making sister the
 excuse, said amuse herself, short time stay
 below, book. mr. hurst looked astonishment.
 
“do prefer reading cards?” said he; “that rather singular.”
 
“miss eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, “despises cards. great
 reader, pleasure anything else.”
 
“i deserve neither praise censure,” cried elizabeth; “i
 _not_ great reader, pleasure many things.”
 
“in nursing sister sure pleasure,” said bingley; “and
 hope will soon increased seeing quite well.”
 
elizabeth thanked heart, walked towards table
 books lying. immediately offered fetch her
 others; library afforded.
 
“and wish collection larger benefit own
 credit; idle fellow; though many, more
 ever looked into.”
 
elizabeth assured suit perfectly those
 room.
 
“i astonished,” said miss bingley, “that father left
 small collection books. delightful library at
 pemberley, mr. darcy!”
 
“it good,” replied: “it work many
 generations.”
 
“and added much yourself--you always buying
 books.”
 
“i comprehend neglect family library days as
 these.”
 
“neglect! sure neglect nothing can add beauties of
 noble place. charles, build _your_ house, wish may be
 half delightful pemberley.”
 
“i wish may.”
 
“but really advise make purchase that
 neighbourhood, take pemberley kind model. a
 finer county england derbyshire.”
 
“with heart: will buy pemberley itself, darcy will sell it.”
 
“i talking possibilities, charles.”
 
“upon word, caroline, think possible get
 pemberley purchase imitation.”
 
elizabeth much caught passed, leave little
 attention book; and, soon laying wholly aside, drew near
 card-table, stationed mr. bingley eldest
 sister, observe game.
 
“is miss darcy much grown since spring?” said miss bingley: “will
 tall am?”
 
“i think will. now miss elizabeth bennet’s height, or
 rather taller.”
 
“how long see again! never met anybody delighted me
 much. countenance, manners, extremely accomplished
 age! performance pianoforte exquisite.”
 
“it amazing me,” said bingley, “how young ladies can patience
 accomplished are.”
 
“all young ladies accomplished! dear charles, mean?”
 
“yes, them, think. paint tables, cover screens, and
 net purses. scarcely know one this; am
 sure never heard young lady spoken first time, without
 informed accomplished.”
 
“your list common extent accomplishments,” said darcy, “has
 much truth. word applied many woman deserves no
 otherwise netting purse covering screen; very
 far agreeing estimation ladies general. i
 boast knowing half-a-dozen whole range my
 acquaintance really accomplished.”
 
“nor i, sure,” said miss bingley.
 
“then,” observed elizabeth, “you must comprehend great deal your
 idea accomplished woman.”
 
“yes; comprehend great deal it.”
 
“oh, certainly,” cried faithful assistant, “no one can really
 esteemed accomplished greatly surpass usually met
 with. woman must thorough knowledge music, singing, drawing,
 dancing, modern languages, deserve word; and, besides all
 this, must possess certain something air manner of
 walking, tone voice, address expressions, word
 will half deserved.”
 
“all must possess,” added darcy; “and must yet add
 something substantial improvement mind extensive
 reading.”
 
“i longer surprised knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
 rather wonder now knowing _any_.”
 
“are severe upon sex doubt possibility all
 this?”
 
“_i_ never saw woman. _i_ never saw capacity, taste, and
 application, elegance, describe, united.”
 
mrs. hurst miss bingley cried injustice her
 implied doubt, protesting knew many women who
 answered description, mr. hurst called order, with
 bitter complaints inattention going forward. all
 conversation thereby end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the
 room.
 
“eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, door closed her, “is
 one young ladies seek recommend other
 sex undervaluing own; many men, daresay, it
 succeeds; but, opinion, paltry device, mean art.”
 
“undoubtedly,” replied darcy, remark chiefly addressed,
 “there meanness _all_ arts ladies sometimes condescend
 employ captivation. whatever bears affinity cunning is
 despicable.”
 
miss bingley entirely satisfied reply to
 continue subject.
 
elizabeth joined say sister worse, and
 leave her. bingley urged mr. jones’s sent for

 service, recommended express town one most
 eminent physicians. hear of; so

 judgment situation. note immediately despatched, and
 contents quickly complied with. mrs. bennet, accompanied her
 two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon family breakfast.
 
found jane apparent danger, mrs. bennet been
 miserable; satisfied seeing illness was
 alarming, wish recovering immediately, her
 restoration health probably remove netherfield. she

 home; neither apothecary, arrived time, think
 advisable. sitting little jane, miss
 bingley’s appearance invitation, mother three daughters all
 attended breakfast parlour. bingley met hopes
 mrs. bennet found miss bennet worse expected.
 
“indeed have, sir,” answer. “she great deal ill be
 moved. mr. jones says must think moving her. must trespass
 little longer kindness.”
 
“removed!” cried bingley. “it must thought of. sister, am
 sure, will hear removal.”
 
“you may depend upon it, madam,” said miss bingley, cold civility,
 “that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention she
 remains us.”
 
mrs. bennet profuse acknowledgments.
 
“i sure,” added, “if good friends, not
 know become her, ill indeed, suffers a
 vast deal, though greatest patience world, is
 always way her, has, without exception, sweetest
 temper ever met with. often tell girls nothing to
 _her_. sweet room here, mr. bingley, charming prospect

 equal netherfield. will think quitting hurry, i
 hope, though short lease.”
 
“whatever done hurry,” replied he; “and therefore i
 resolve quit netherfield, probably five
 minutes. present, however, consider quite fixed here.”
 
“that exactly supposed you,” said elizabeth.
 
“you begin comprehend me, you?” cried he, turning towards her.
 
“oh yes--i understand perfectly.”
 
“i wish might take compliment; easily seen
 through, afraid, pitiful.”
 
“that happens. necessarily follow deep,
 intricate character less estimable one yours.”
 
“lizzy,” cried mother, “remember are, run in
 wild manner suffered home.”
 
“i know before,” continued bingley, immediately, “that were
 studier character. must amusing study.”
 
“yes; intricate characters _most_ amusing. at
 least advantage.”
 
“the country,” said darcy, “can general supply subjects for
 study. country neighbourhood move confined and
 unvarying society.”
 
“but people alter much, something new be
 observed ever.”
 
“yes, indeed,” cried mrs. bennet, offended manner mentioning a
 country neighbourhood. “i assure quite much _that_
 going country town.”
 
everybody surprised; darcy, looking moment,
 turned silently away. mrs. bennet, fancied gained complete
 victory him, continued triumph,--
 
“i see london great advantage country, for
 part, except shops public places. country vast deal
 pleasanter, it, mr. bingley?”
 
“when country,” replied, “i never wish leave it; and
 town, pretty much same. their
 advantages, can equally happy either.”
 
“ay, right disposition. that
 gentleman,” looking darcy, “seemed think country nothing
 all.”
 
“indeed, mamma, mistaken,” said elizabeth, blushing her
 mother. “you quite mistook mr. darcy. meant not
 variety people met country town, which
 must acknowledge true.”
 
“certainly, dear, nobody said were; meeting with
 many people neighbourhood, believe few
 neighbourhoods larger. know dine four-and-twenty families.”
 
nothing concern elizabeth enable bingley keep his
 countenance. sister less delicate, directed eye towards
 mr. darcy expressive smile. elizabeth, sake of
 saying something might turn mother’s thoughts, now asked if
 charlotte lucas longbourn since _her_ coming away.
 
“yes, called yesterday father. agreeable man sir
 william is, mr. bingley--is he? much man fashion! so
 genteel easy! always something say everybody. _that_
 idea good breeding; persons fancy very
 important never open mouths quite mistake matter.”
 
“did charlotte dine you?”
 
“no, go home. fancy wanted mince-pies. for
 part, mr. bingley, _i_ always keep servants can own
 work; _my_ daughters brought differently. everybody to
 judge themselves, lucases good sort girls, i
 assure you. pity handsome! _i_ think
 charlotte _very_ plain; particular friend.”
 
“she seems pleasant young woman,” said bingley.
 
“oh dear, yes; must plain. lady lucas herself
 often said so, envied jane’s beauty. like boast

 better looking. everybody says. trust own
 partiality. fifteen gentleman my
 brother gardiner’s town much love her, my
 sister-in-law sure make offer came away.
 but, however, not. perhaps thought young. however, he
 wrote verses her, pretty were.”
 
“and ended affection,” said elizabeth, impatiently. “there has
 many one, fancy, overcome way. wonder first
 discovered efficacy poetry driving away love!”
 
“i used consider poetry _food_ love,” said darcy.
 
“of fine, stout, healthy love may. everything nourishes is
 strong already. slight, thin sort inclination, i
 convinced one good sonnet will starve entirely away.”
 
darcy smiled; general pause ensued made elizabeth
 tremble lest mother exposing again. longed to
 speak, think nothing say; short silence mrs.
 bennet began repeating thanks mr. bingley kindness to
 jane, apology troubling also lizzy. mr. bingley was
 unaffectedly civil answer, forced younger sister be
 civil also, say occasion required. performed part,
 indeed, without much graciousness, mrs. bennet satisfied, and
 soon afterwards ordered carriage. upon signal, youngest of
 daughters put forward. two girls whispering to
 whole visit; result was, the
 youngest tax mr. bingley promised first coming

 added, “i shall insist giving one also. shall tell colonel

mrs. bennet daughters departed, elizabeth returned
 instantly jane, leaving relations’ behaviour the

 mr. darcy writing, miss bingley, seated near him, watching

 messages sister. mr. hurst mr. bingley piquet, and
 mrs. hurst observing game.
 
elizabeth took needlework, sufficiently amused in
 attending passed darcy companion. perpetual
 commendations lady either hand-writing, evenness

 exactly unison opinion each.
 
“how delighted miss darcy will receive letter!”
 
made answer.
 
“you write uncommonly fast.”
 
“you mistaken. write rather slowly.”
 
“how many letters must occasion write course a

“it fortunate, then, fall lot instead yours.”
 
“pray tell sister long see her.”
 
“i already told once, desire.”
 
“i afraid like pen. let mend you. mend

“thank you--but always mend own.”
 
“how can contrive write even?”
 
silent.
 
“tell sister delighted hear improvement harp,

“will give leave defer raptures till write again? at

“oh, consequence. shall see january. you
 always write charming long letters her, mr. darcy?”
 
“they generally long; whether always charming, me
 determine.”
 
“it rule me, person can write long letter with
 ease write ill.”
 
“that will compliment darcy, caroline,” cried her
 brother, “because _not_ write ease. studies much
 words four syllables. you, darcy?”
 
“my style writing different yours.”
 
“oh,” cried miss bingley, “charles writes careless way
 imaginable. leaves half words, blots rest.”
 
“my ideas flow rapidly time express them; which
 means letters sometimes convey ideas correspondents.”
 
“your humility, mr. bingley,” said elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”
 
“nothing deceitful,” said darcy, “than appearance of
 humility. often carelessness opinion, sometimes an
 indirect boast.”
 
“and two call _my_ little recent piece modesty?”
 
“the indirect boast; really proud defects in

 bennet morning, ever resolved quitting netherfield

“nay,” cried bingley, “this much, remember night the

“i daresay believed it; means convinced you

 go--and, another word, might stay month.”
 
“you proved this,” cried elizabeth, “that mr. bingley did

“i exceedingly gratified,” said bingley, “by converting my
 friend says compliment sweetness temper. am
 afraid giving turn gentleman means

“would mr. darcy consider rashness original intention

“upon word, exactly explain matter--darcy must speak for

“you expect account opinions choose call mine,

“to yield readily--easily--to _persuasion_ friend merit

“to yield without conviction compliment understanding of

“you appear me, mr. darcy, allow nothing influence of

“will advisable, proceed subject, arrange

“by means,” cried bingley; “let us hear particulars, not

 darcy great tall fellow, comparison with

 particular places; house especially, sunday evening,

mr. darcy smiled; elizabeth thought perceive was
 rather offended, therefore checked laugh. miss bingley warmly
 resented indignity received, expostulation her
 brother talking nonsense.
 
“i see design, bingley,” said friend. “you dislike argument,
 want silence this.”
 
“perhaps do. arguments much like disputes. miss
 bennet will defer till room, shall very
 thankful; may say whatever like me.”
 
“what ask,” said elizabeth, “is sacrifice side; mr.

mr. darcy took advice, finish letter.
 
business over, applied miss bingley elizabeth

 seated herself.

playing italian songs, miss bingley varied charm a
 lively scotch air; soon afterwards mr. darcy, drawing near
 elizabeth, said her,--
 
“do feel great inclination, miss bennet, seize an
 opportunity dancing reel?”
 
smiled, made answer. repeated question, some
 surprise silence.
 
“oh,” said she, “i heard before; immediately

“indeed dare.”
 
elizabeth, rather expected affront him, amazed his

miss bingley saw, suspected, enough jealous; great
 anxiety recovery dear friend jane received some

often tried provoke darcy disliking guest, talking of
 supposed marriage, planning happiness alliance.
 
“i hope,” said she, walking together shrubbery the
 next day, “you will give mother-in-law hints, this

gentlemen entered, jane longer first object;
 miss bingley’s eyes instantly turned towards darcy, had
 something say advanced many steps. addressed
 directly miss bennet polite congratulation; mr. hurst
 also made slight bow, said “very glad;” diffuseness

 attention. first half hour spent piling fire, lest she

 darcy wish cards, mr. hurst soon found even open

 silence whole party subject seemed justify her. mr.
 hurst had, therefore, nothing stretch one the
 sofas go sleep. darcy took book. miss bingley same;
 mrs. hurst, principally occupied playing bracelets and
 rings, joined now brother’s conversation miss
 bennet.
 
miss bingley’s attention quite much engaged watching mr.
 darcy’s progress _his_ book, reading own; was
 perpetually either making inquiry, looking page. she
 win him, however, conversation; merely answered her
 question read on. length, quite exhausted attempt be

 second volume his, gave great yawn said, “how pleasant it

one made reply. yawned again, threw aside book, and
 cast eyes round room quest amusement; when, hearing
 brother mentioning ball miss bennet, turned suddenly
 towards said,--
 
“by bye charles, really serious meditating dance at
 netherfield? advise you, determine it, consult
 wishes present party; much mistaken not

 pleasure.”
 
“if mean darcy,” cried brother, “he may go bed, he
 chooses, begins; ball, quite settled
 thing, soon nicholls made white soup enough shall send

“i like balls infinitely better,” replied, “if were
 carried different manner; something insufferably
 tedious usual process meeting. surely much
 rational conversation instead dancing made order the

“much rational, dear caroline, dare say; be
 near much like ball.”
 
miss bingley made answer, soon afterwards got walked about

 aimed, still inflexibly studious. the
 desperation feelings, resolved one effort more; and,
 turning elizabeth, said,--
 
“miss eliza bennet, let persuade follow example, take a
 turn room. assure refreshing sitting so
 long one attitude.”
 
elizabeth surprised, agreed immediately. miss bingley
 succeeded less real object civility: mr. darcy looked
 up. much awake novelty attention quarter as

 directly invited join party, declined it, observing that

“not all,” answer; “but, depend upon it, means be

 nothing it.”
 
miss bingley, however, incapable disappointing mr. darcy in
 anything, persevered, therefore, requiring explanation his
 two motives.
 
“i smallest objection explaining them,” said he, soon
 allowed speak. “you either choose method passing
 evening other’s confidence, secret
 affairs discuss, conscious figures
 appear greatest advantage walking: first, be
 completely way; second, can admire much better

“oh, shocking!” cried miss bingley. “i never heard anything so
 abominable. shall punish speech?”
 
“nothing easy, inclination,” said elizabeth. “we

“but upon honour _not_. assure intimacy not

 no; feel may defy us there. laughter, will expose

 darcy may hug himself.”
 
“mr. darcy laughed at!” cried elizabeth. “that an
 uncommon advantage, uncommon hope will continue, would

 laugh.”
 
“miss bingley,” said he, “has given credit can be. the
 wisest best men,--nay, wisest best actions,--may

“certainly,” replied elizabeth, “there people, hope am

“perhaps possible anyone. study of

“such vanity pride.”
 
“yes, vanity weakness indeed. pride--where real

elizabeth turned away hide smile.
 
“your examination mr. darcy over, presume,” said miss bingley;
 “and pray result?”
 
“i perfectly convinced mr. darcy defect. owns it

“no,” said darcy, “i made pretension. faults enough,

“but what,” said she, pause, “can motive? can

“a thorough, determined dislike me--a dislike but

“i thought mr. darcy bad this--though never liked

“i will trust subject,” replied wickham; “_i_ can

elizabeth deep thought, time exclaimed, “to

 with--“and one, too, probably companion from

“we born parish, within park; greatest

“how strange!” cried elizabeth. “how abominable! wonder very

 dishonesty must call it.”
 
“it _is_ wonderful,” replied wickham; “for almost actions may be

“can abominable pride ever done good?”
 
“yes; often led liberal generous; give money

many pauses many trials subjects, elizabeth not
 help reverting first, saying,--
 
“i astonished intimacy mr. bingley. can mr. bingley,
 seems good-humour itself, is, really believe, truly amiable,
 friendship man? can suit other? you

“not all.”
 
“he sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. know mr.

“probably not; mr. darcy can please chooses. not
 want abilities. can conversible companion thinks worth

 different man less prosperous. pride
 never deserts him; rich liberal-minded, just,
 sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing
 something fortune figure.”

 elizabeth mrs. philips. usual inquiries success were
 made latter. great; lost every point;
 mrs. philips began express concern thereupon, assured
 her, much earnest gravity, least importance;
 considered money mere trifle, begged not

“i know well, madam,” said he, “that persons sit a
 card table must take chance things,--and happily i
 circumstances make five shillings object. there
 are, undoubtedly, many say same; but, thanks lady
 catherine bourgh, removed far beyond necessity regarding
 little matters.”
 
mr. wickham’s attention caught; observing mr. collins for
 moments, asked elizabeth low voice whether relations
 intimately acquainted family bourgh.
 
“lady catherine bourgh,” replied, “has lately given a
 living. hardly know mr. collins first introduced her
 notice, certainly known long.”
 
“you know course lady catherine bourgh lady anne darcy
 sisters; consequently aunt present mr. darcy.”
 
“no, indeed, not. knew nothing lady catherine’s
 connections. never heard existence till day before
 yesterday.”
 
“her daughter, miss bourgh, will large fortune, is
 believed cousin will unite two estates.”
 
information made elizabeth smile, thought poor miss
 bingley. vain indeed must attentions, vain useless her
 affection sister praise himself, already
 self-destined another.
 
“mr. collins,” said she, “speaks highly lady catherine her
 daughter; but, particulars related her
 ladyship, suspect gratitude misleads him; that, spite of
 patroness, arrogant, conceited woman.”
 
“i believe great degree,” replied wickham; “i have
 seen many years; well remember never liked
 her, manners dictatorial insolent. the
 reputation remarkably sensible clever; rather believe
 derives part abilities rank fortune, part from
 authoritative manner, rest pride nephew, who
 chooses everyone connected understanding of
 first class.”
 
elizabeth allowed given rational account it, and
 continued talking together mutual satisfaction till supper put
 end cards, gave rest ladies share mr.
 wickham’s attentions. conversation noise of
 mrs. philips’s supper party, manners recommended to
 everybody. whatever said, said well; whatever did, done
 gracefully. elizabeth went away head full him. could
 think nothing mr. wickham, told her, all
 way home; time even mention name as
 went, neither lydia mr. collins silent. lydia
 talked incessantly lottery tickets, fish lost the

 mrs. philips, protesting least regard losses

 crowded cousins, say well manage

elizabeth related jane, next day, passed mr.

 veracity young man amiable appearance wickham. the
 possibility really endured unkindness enough to
 interest tender feelings; nothing therefore remained be
 done think well both, defend conduct each, and
 throw account accident mistake whatever be
 otherwise explained.
 
“they both,” said she, “been deceived, dare say, way or
 other, can form idea. interested people perhaps
 misrepresented other. is, short, impossible us to
 conjecture causes circumstances may alienated them,
 without actual blame either side.”
 
“very true, indeed; now, dear jane, got say in
 behalf interested people probably concerned the
 business? clear _them_, too, shall obliged think ill of
 somebody.”
 
“laugh much choose, will laugh my
 opinion. dearest lizzy, consider disgraceful light

 impossible. man common humanity, man value his
 character, capable it. can intimate friends so
 excessively deceived him? oh no.”
 
“i can much easily believe mr. bingley’s imposed that
 mr. wickham invent history gave last
 night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. not
 so, let mr. darcy contradict it. besides, truth looks.”
 
“it difficult, indeed--it distressing. one know to
 think.”
 
“i beg pardon;--one knows exactly think.”
 
jane think certainty one point,--that mr.
 bingley, _had been_ imposed on, much suffer when
 affair became public.
 
two young ladies summoned shrubbery, this
 conversation passed, arrival persons whom
 speaking; mr. bingley sisters came give their
 personal invitation long expected ball netherfield, was
 fixed following tuesday. two ladies delighted see
 dear friend again, called age since met, and
 repeatedly asked since their
 separation. rest family paid little attention;
 avoiding mrs. bennet much possible, saying much elizabeth,
 nothing others. soon gone again, rising from
 seats activity took brother surprise, and
 hurrying eager escape mrs. bennet’s civilities.
 
prospect netherfield ball extremely agreeable every
 female family. mrs. bennet chose consider given in
 compliment eldest daughter, particularly flattered by
 receiving invitation mr. bingley himself, instead a
 ceremonious card. jane pictured happy evening the
 society two friends, attentions brother; and
 elizabeth thought pleasure dancing great deal mr.
 wickham, seeing confirmation everything mr. darcy’s look

 less single event, particular person; though they
 each, like elizabeth, meant dance half evening mr. wickham,
 means partner satisfy them, ball
 was, rate, ball. even mary assure family she
 disinclination it.
 
“while can mornings myself,” said she, “it enough. i
 think sacrifice join occasionally evening engagements.
 society claims us all; profess one who
 consider intervals recreation amusement desirable for
 everybody.”
 
elizabeth’s spirits high occasion, though did
 often speak unnecessarily mr. collins, help asking
 whether intended accept mr. bingley’s invitation, he
 did, whether think proper join evening’s
 amusement; rather surprised find entertained no
 scruple whatever head, far dreading rebuke,

“i means opinion, assure you,” said he, “that ball of

 myself, shall hope honoured hands fair
 cousins course evening; take opportunity of
 soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, two first dances especially; a
 preference trust cousin jane will attribute right
 cause, disrespect her.”
 
elizabeth felt completely taken in. fully proposed being
 engaged wickham dances; mr. collins
 instead!--her liveliness never worse timed. help
 it, however. mr. wickham’s happiness perforce
 delayed little longer, mr. collins’s proposal accepted as
 good grace could. better pleased his
 gallantry, idea suggested something more. now first

 consequence reply. mr. collins might never make offer, and,
 till did, useless quarrel him.

“i think speaking all. sir william have

“i sorry think so; case, can least be

“yes, always,” replied, without knowing said; her

“i hope not.”
 
“it particularly incumbent never change opinion,

“may ask questions tend?”
 
“merely illustration _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring

“and success?”

“i can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary

“but take likeness now, may never another

“i means suspend pleasure yours,” coldly replied.
 said more, went dance parted in

 darcy’s breast tolerably powerful feeling towards her,

long separated miss bingley came towards her, and,
 expression civil disdain, thus accosted her,--
 
“so, miss eliza, hear quite delighted george wickham?

 questions; find young man forgot tell you, among his

“his guilt descent appear, account, same,”
 said elizabeth, angrily; “for heard accuse nothing
 worse mr. darcy’s steward, _that_, can
 assure you, informed himself.”
 
“i beg pardon,” replied miss bingley, turning away sneer.
 “excuse interference; kindly meant.”
 
“insolent girl!” said elizabeth herself. “you much mistaken if
 expect influence paltry attack this. see
 nothing wilful ignorance malice mr.
 darcy.” sought eldest sister, undertaken make
 inquiries subject bingley. jane met smile of
 sweet complacency, glow happy expression, sufficiently
 marked well satisfied occurrences evening.
 elizabeth instantly read feelings; and, moment, solicitude
 wickham, resentment enemies, everything else, gave
 way hope jane’s fairest way happiness.
 
“i want know,” said she, countenance less smiling her
 sister’s, “what learnt mr. wickham. perhaps have
 pleasantly engaged think third person, case

“no,” replied jane, “i forgotten him; nothing
 satisfactory tell you. mr. bingley know whole his

 principally offended mr. darcy; will vouch good conduct,

 mr. wickham deserved much less attention mr. darcy has
 received; sorry say account, well his

 afraid imprudent, deserved lose mr. darcy’s

“mr. bingley know mr. wickham himself.”
 
“no; never saw till morning meryton.”
 
“this account received mr. darcy. am
 perfectly satisfied. say living?”
 
“he exactly recollect circumstances, though heard
 mr. darcy once, believes left to

“i doubt mr. bingley’s sincerity,” said elizabeth warmly,
 “but must excuse convinced assurances only. mr.
 bingley’s defence friend able one, dare say; but
 since unacquainted several parts story, learnt
 rest friend himself, shall venture still think of
 gentlemen before.”
 
changed discourse one gratifying each, on
 difference sentiment. elizabeth listened with
 delight happy though modest hopes jane entertained of
 bingley’s regard, said power heighten confidence

 partner scarcely replied, mr. collins came them,
 told great exultation, just fortunate

“i found out,” said he, “by singular accident, now

“you going introduce mr. darcy?”
 
“indeed am. shall entreat pardon done earlier.

elizabeth tried hard dissuade scheme; assuring him
 mr. darcy consider addressing without introduction as
 impertinent freedom, rather compliment aunt; it
 least necessary notice either
 side, were, must belong mr. darcy, superior in
 consequence, begin acquaintance. mr. collins listened with

 discouraged speaking again, mr. darcy’s contempt seemed
 abundantly increasing length second speech; the
 end made slight bow, moved another way: mr.
 collins returned elizabeth.
 
“i reason, assure you,” said he, “to dissatisfied my
 reception. mr. darcy seemed much pleased attention. answered
 utmost civility, even paid compliment saying,

 perhaps almost happy jane. saw idea settled that

 concluded many good wishes lady lucas might soon equally

“what mr. darcy me, pray, afraid him? am

“for heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. advantage can you

elizabeth sitting mother sisters, reflecting what
 heard, doubting whether authorized mention it,
 sir william lucas appeared, sent daughter to
 announce engagement family. many compliments them,
 much self-gratulation prospect connection the
 houses, unfolded matter,--to audience merely wondering,
 incredulous; mrs. bennet, perseverance than
 politeness, protested must entirely mistaken; lydia, always
 unguarded often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--
 
“good lord! sir william, can tell story? know
 mr. collins wants marry lizzy?”
 
nothing less complaisance courtier borne
 without anger treatment: sir william’s good-breeding carried
 all; though begged leave positive the
 truth information, listened impertinence the
 forbearing courtesy.
 
elizabeth, feeling incumbent relieve unpleasant
 situation, now put forward confirm account, by
 mentioning prior knowledge charlotte herself; and
 endeavoured put stop exclamations mother sisters,
 earnestness congratulations sir william, she
 readily joined jane, making variety remarks the
 happiness might expected match, excellent character

mrs. bennet was, fact, much overpowered say great deal while
 sir william remained; sooner left feelings
 found rapid vent. first place, persisted disbelieving
 whole matter; secondly, sure mr. collins
 taken in; thirdly, trusted never happy

 inferences, however, plainly deduced whole: one, that
 elizabeth real cause mischief; other, that
 barbarously used all; two
 points principally dwelt rest day. nothing could
 console nothing appease her. day wear her
 resentment. week elapsed see elizabeth without
 scolding her: month passed away speak sir william
 lady lucas without rude; many months gone she
 forgive daughter.
 
mr. bennet’s emotions much tranquil occasion, such
 experience pronounced agreeable sort; for
 gratified him, said, discover charlotte lucas, had
 used think tolerably sensible, foolish wife, and
 foolish daughter!

 called longbourn rather oftener usual say happy was,
 though mrs. bennet’s sour looks ill-natured remarks might been
 enough drive happiness away.
 
elizabeth charlotte restraint kept them
 mutually silent subject; elizabeth felt persuaded no
 real confidence ever subsist again. her
 disappointment charlotte made turn fonder regard her
 sister, whose rectitude delicacy sure opinion could
 never shaken, whose happiness grew daily anxious, as
 bingley now gone week, nothing heard return.
 
jane sent caroline early answer letter, counting
 days till might reasonably hope hear again. promised
 letter thanks mr. collins arrived tuesday, addressed their
 father, written solemnity gratitude a
 twelve-month’s abode family might prompted. after
 discharging conscience head, proceeded inform them,

neither jane elizabeth comfortable subject. day after
 day passed away without bringing tidings the
 report shortly prevailed meryton coming to
 netherfield whole winter; report highly incensed mrs.
 bennet, never failed contradict scandalous
 falsehood.
 
even elizabeth began fear--not bingley indifferent--but that
 sisters successful keeping away. unwilling she
 admit idea destructive jane’s happiness, so
 dishonourable stability lover, prevent its
 frequently recurring. united efforts two unfeeling sisters,
 overpowering friend, assisted attractions miss
 darcy amusements london, might much, feared, for

 never alluded to. delicacy restrained mother, an

mr. collins returned punctually monday fortnight, his

 and, luckily others, business love-making relieved them

miss bingley’s letter arrived, put end doubt. first
 sentence conveyed assurance settled london for
 winter, concluded brother’s regret had
 time pay respects friends hertfordshire left
 country.
 
hope over, entirely over; jane attend rest of
 letter, found little, except professed affection the
 writer, give comfort. miss darcy’s praise occupied
 chief it. many attractions dwelt on; caroline
 boasted joyfully increasing intimacy, ventured predict
 accomplishment wishes unfolded former
 letter. wrote also great pleasure brother’s an
 inmate mr. darcy’s house, mentioned raptures plans of
 latter regard new furniture.
 
elizabeth, jane soon communicated chief this,
 heard silent indignation. heart divided concern
 sister resentment others. caroline’s
 assertion brother’s partial miss darcy, paid no
 credit. really fond jane, doubted she
 ever done; much always disposed like him, she
 think without anger, hardly without contempt, easiness
 temper, want proper resolution, now made slave
 designing friends, led sacrifice happiness to
 caprice inclinations. happiness, however, been
 sacrifice, might allowed sport in
 whatever manner thought best; sister’s involved it, as
 thought must sensible himself. subject, short, on
 reflection long indulged, must unavailing. she
 think nothing else; yet, whether bingley’s regard had
 really died away, suppressed friends’ interference;
 whether aware jane’s attachment, whether had
 escaped observation; whichever case, though opinion of
 must materially affected difference, sister’s
 situation remained same, peace equally wounded.
 
day two passed jane courage speak feelings to
 elizabeth; last, mrs. bennet’s leaving together, a
 longer irritation usual netherfield master, could
 help saying,--
 
“o dear mother command herself! can no
 idea pain gives continual reflections him. i
 will repine. last long. will forgot, shall
 before.”
 
elizabeth looked sister incredulous solicitude, said
 nothing.
 
“you doubt me,” cried jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, no
 reason. may live memory amiable man my
 acquaintance all. nothing either hope fear, and
 nothing reproach with. thank god _that_ pain. little

“nay,” said elizabeth, “this fair. _you_ wish think the

 mrs. bennet many grievances relate, much complain of. they
 ill-used since last saw sister. two her

mrs. gardiner, chief news given before, in
 course jane elizabeth’s correspondence her, made her
 sister slight answer, and, compassion nieces, turned the
 conversation.
 
alone elizabeth afterwards, spoke subject.
 “it seems likely desirable match jane,” said she. “i
 sorry went off. things happen often! young man,
 describe mr. bingley, easily falls love pretty
 girl weeks, and, accident separates them, easily
 forgets her, sort inconstancies frequent.”

“an excellent consolation way,” said elizabeth; “but will not

 interference friends will persuade young man of
 independent fortune think girl violently in
 love days before.”
 
“but expression ‘violently love’ hackneyed, so
 doubtful, indefinite, gives little idea. as
 often applied feelings arise half hour’s
 acquaintance, real, strong attachment. pray, _violent was_
 mr. bingley’s love?”
 
“i never saw promising inclination; growing quite

“oh, yes! kind love suppose felt. poor
 jane! sorry her, because, disposition, may get

 laughed sooner. think would

 anything.”
 
elizabeth exceedingly pleased proposal, felt persuaded
 sister’s ready acquiescence.
 
“i hope,” added mrs. gardiner, “that consideration regard to
 young man will influence her. live different part of
 town, connections different, and, well know, go
 little, improbable meet all,
 unless really comes see her.”
 
“and _that_ quite impossible; now custody his
 friend, mr. darcy suffer call jane a
 part london! dear aunt, think it? mr. darcy may,
 perhaps, _heard_ place gracechurch street, he
 hardly think month’s ablution enough cleanse its
 impurities, enter it; and, depend upon it, mr. bingley
 never stirs without him.”
 
“so much better. hope will meet all. jane
 correspond sister? _she_ will able help calling.”
 
“she will drop acquaintance entirely.”
 
but, spite certainty elizabeth affected place this
 point, well still interesting one bingley’s being
 withheld seeing jane, felt solicitude subject which
 convinced her, examination, consider entirely
 hopeless. possible, sometimes thought probable, that
 affection might re-animated, influence friends
 successfully combated natural influence jane’s
 attractions.
 
miss bennet accepted aunt’s invitation pleasure; the
 bingleys otherwise thoughts time she
 hoped, caroline’s living house brother, she
 might occasionally spend morning her, without danger of
 seeing him.
 
gardiners stayed week longbourn; philipses,
 lucases, officers, day without its
 engagement. mrs. bennet carefully provided entertainment
 brother sister, sit family
 dinner. engagement home, officers always
 made part it, officers mr. wickham sure one; and
 occasions mrs. gardiner, rendered suspicious elizabeth’s
 warm commendation him, narrowly observed both. without supposing
 them, saw, seriously love, preference
 plain enough make little uneasy; she
 resolved speak elizabeth subject left
 hertfordshire, represent imprudence encouraging such
 attachment.
 
mrs. gardiner, wickham one means affording pleasure,
 unconnected general powers. ten dozen years ago,
 marriage, spent considerable time part
 derbyshire belonged. had, therefore, many
 acquaintance common; and, though wickham little since
 death darcy’s father, five years before, yet power
 give fresher intelligence former friends been
 way procuring.
 
mrs. gardiner seen pemberley, known late mr. darcy by
 character perfectly well. here, consequently, inexhaustible
 subject discourse. comparing recollection pemberley with
 minute description wickham give, bestowing her
 tribute praise character late possessor, was
 delighting herself. made acquainted the
 present mr. darcy’s treatment him, tried remember something of
 gentleman’s reputed disposition, quite lad, might
 agree it; confident, last, recollected having
 heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken proud,

“you sensible girl, lizzy, fall love merely you

“my dear aunt, serious indeed.”
 
“yes, hope engage serious likewise.”
 
“well, then, need alarm. will take care of
 myself, mr. wickham too. shall love me, i
 can prevent it.”
 
“elizabeth, serious now.”
 
“i beg pardon. will try again. present love with
 mr. wickham; no, certainly not. is, beyond comparison,
 agreeable man ever saw--and becomes really attached to

 sorry means making unhappy; but

“perhaps will well discourage coming very

 honour, will try think wisest; now hope you

 kindness hints, parted,--a wonderful instance advice
 given point without resented.
 
mr. collins returned hertfordshire soon quitted

 marriage now fast approaching; length far resigned

“i shall depend hearing often, eliza.”
 
“_that_ certainly shall.”
 
“and another favour ask. will come see me?”
 
“we shall often meet, hope, hertfordshire.”
 
“i likely leave kent time. promise me, therefore, to

elizabeth refuse, though foresaw little pleasure the
 visit.
 
“my father maria come march,” added charlotte, “and
 hope will consent party. indeed, eliza, will be
 welcome either them.”
 
wedding took place: bride bridegroom set kent from
 church door, everybody much say hear the
 subject usual. elizabeth soon heard friend, their
 correspondence regular frequent ever been: it
 equally unreserved impossible. elizabeth never
 address without feeling comfort intimacy over;
 and, though determined slacken correspondent, the
 sake rather was. charlotte’s first letters
 received good deal eagerness: be
 curiosity know speak new home, would
 like lady catherine, happy dare pronounce to
 be; though, letters read, elizabeth felt charlotte
 expressed every point exactly might foreseen. she
 wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded comforts, mentioned nothing
 praise. house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
 roads, taste, lady catherine’s behaviour most
 friendly obliging. mr. collins’s picture hunsford and
 rosings rationally softened; elizabeth perceived must wait

jane already written lines sister, announce their
 safe arrival london; wrote again, elizabeth hoped it
 power say something bingleys.

 catherine spoke awful extraordinary talents or

 thought witness without trepidation.
 
entrance hall, mr. collins pointed out, a
 rapturous air, fine proportion finished ornaments, followed
 servants antechamber room lady catherine,

 condescension, arose receive them; mrs. collins settled it
 husband office introduction hers, was
 performed proper manner, without apologies thanks

spite st. james’s, sir william completely
 awed grandeur surrounding him, just courage
 enough make low bow, take seat without saying word;

 visitors forget inferior rank. rendered formidable by
 silence: whatever said spoken authoritative tone as
 marked self-importance, brought mr. wickham immediately to
 elizabeth’s mind; and, observation day altogether, she
 believed lady catherine exactly represented.
 
when, examining mother, whose countenance deportment
 soon found resemblance mr. darcy, turned eyes the
 daughter, almost joined maria’s astonishment her
 thin small. neither figure face any

 little miss bourgh ate, pressing try dish and
 fearing indisposed. maria thought speaking question,
 gentlemen nothing eat admire.
 
ladies returned drawing-room, little be

 pretty kind girl. asked different times many sisters
 had, whether older younger herself, whether of
 likely married, whether handsome, they
 educated, carriage father kept, her
 mother’s maiden name? elizabeth felt impertinence her
 questions, answered composedly. lady catherine then
 observed,--
 
“your father’s estate entailed mr. collins, think? your

“we never governess.”
 
“no governess! possible? five daughters brought home

elizabeth hardly help smiling, assured not

“then taught you? attended you? without governess, must

“compared families, believe were; us as

“ay, doubt: governess will prevent; had

“upon word,” said ladyship, “you give opinion decidedly

“with three younger sisters grown up,” replied elizabeth, smiling, “your

lady catherine seemed quite astonished receiving direct answer;
 elizabeth suspected first creature ever

“you twenty, sure,--therefore need not

“i one-and-twenty.”

 towards look curiosity; ladyship, a
 while, shared feeling, openly acknowledged, not
 scruple call out,--
 
“what saying, fitzwilliam? talking

“we talking music, madam,” said he, longer able avoid

mr. darcy spoke affectionate praise sister’s proficiency.
 
“i glad hear good account her,” said lady
 catherine; “and pray tell me, expect excel,

“i assure you, madam,” replied, “that need advice.

mr. darcy looked little ashamed aunt’s ill-breeding, made
 answer.
 
coffee over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth having
 promised play him; sat directly instrument. he
 drew chair near her. lady catherine listened half song, then
 talked, before, nephew; till latter walked away from

“i shall say mistaken,” replied, “because could

elizabeth laughed heartily picture herself, said to
 colonel fitzwilliam, “your cousin will give pretty notion of

“i afraid you,” said he, smilingly.
 
“pray let hear accuse of,” cried colonel
 fitzwilliam. “i like know behaves among strangers.”
 
“you shall hear, then--but prepare something dreadful. the

“i time honour knowing lady assembly

“true; nobody can ever introduced ball-room. well, colonel
 fitzwilliam, play next? fingers wait orders.”
 
“perhaps,” said darcy, “i judged better sought an

“shall ask cousin reason this?” said elizabeth, still

“i certainly talent people possess,” said darcy,

“my fingers,” said elizabeth, “do move instrument the

darcy smiled said, “you perfectly right. employed your

interrupted lady catherine, called know

 lady catherine approached, and, listening minutes, said
 darcy,--
 
“miss bennet play amiss practised more, and

elizabeth looked darcy, see cordially assented his
 cousin’s praise: neither moment she

lady catherine continued remarks elizabeth’s performance, mixing

 forbearance civility; request the
 gentlemen remained instrument till ladyship’s carriage was

“how suddenly quitted netherfield last november, mr. darcy!

“perfectly so, thank you.”

“i never heard say so; probable may spend

“if means little netherfield, better the

 might possibly get settled family there. but, perhaps, mr. bingley did
 take house much convenience neighbourhood as

“i surprised,” said darcy, “if give as

elizabeth made answer. afraid talking longer his

took hint soon began with, “this seems comfortable

 collins first came hunsford.”
 
“i believe did--and sure bestowed her

“mr. collins appears fortunate choice wife.”
 
“yes, indeed; friends may well rejoice met one of
 sensible women accepted him, made

 certain consider marrying mr. collins wisest

 prudential light, certainly good match her.”
 
“it must agreeable settled within easy a

“an easy distance call it? nearly fifty miles.”
 
“and fifty miles good road? little half day’s
 journey. yes, call easy distance.”
 
“i never considered distance one _advantages_

“it proof attachment hertfordshire. anything beyond

spoke sort smile, elizabeth fancied she

“i mean say woman may settled near her

mr. darcy drew chair little towards her, said, “_you_ cannot

elizabeth looked surprised. gentleman experienced change of

“and able please arrangement, least

“he likes way well,” replied colonel fitzwilliam.
 “but do. better means than

“in opinion, younger earl can know little of

“these home questions--and perhaps say have

“unless like women fortune, think often

“our habits expense make us dependent, many in
 rank life can afford marry without attention to

“is this,” thought elizabeth, “meant me?” coloured the
 idea; but, recovering herself, said lively tone, “and pray, is
 usual price earl’s younger son? unless elder brother is
 sickly, suppose ask fifty thousand pounds.”
 
answered style, subject dropped. interrupt

“i imagine cousin brought chiefly sake of

“are you, indeed? pray sort guardian make? does

 may like way.”
 
spoke, observed looking earnestly; manner
 immediately asked supposed miss darcy likely to
 give uneasiness, convinced somehow other
 got pretty near truth. directly replied,--
 
“you need frightened. never heard harm her; dare
 say one tractable creatures world. a
 great favourite ladies acquaintance, mrs. hurst and
 miss bingley. think heard say know them.”
 
“i know little. brother pleasant, gentlemanlike
 man--he great friend darcy’s.”
 
“oh yes,” said elizabeth drily--“mr. darcy uncommonly kind mr.
 bingley, takes prodigious deal care him.”
 
“care him! yes, really believe darcy _does_ take care in
 points wants care. something told me
 journey hither, reason think bingley much indebted

“what mean?”
 
“it circumstance darcy course wish be

“you may depend upon mentioning it.”
 
“and remember much reason supposing be

 imprudent marriage, without mentioning names other

“did mr. darcy give reasons interference?”
 
“i understood strong objections the
 lady.”
 
“and arts use separate them?”
 
“he talk arts,” said fitzwilliam, smiling. “he
 told now told you.”
 
elizabeth made answer, walked on, heart swelling with
 indignation. watching little, fitzwilliam asked she
 thoughtful.
 
“i thinking telling me,” said she. “your
 cousin’s conduct suit feelings. the
 judge?”
 
“you rather disposed call interference officious?”
 
“i see right mr. darcy decide propriety his
 friend’s inclination; why, upon judgment alone, to
 determine direct manner friend happy. but,”
 continued, recollecting herself, “as know none the
 particulars, fair condemn him. supposed
 much affection case.”
 
“that unnatural surmise,” said fitzwilliam; “but is
 lessening honour cousin’s triumph sadly.”
 
spoken jestingly, appeared just picture of
 mr. darcy, trust answer; and,
 therefore, abruptly changing conversation, talked indifferent
 matters till reached parsonage. there, shut room,

 inflicted.
 
“there strong objections lady,” colonel
 fitzwilliam’s words; strong objections probably were, her
 one uncle country attorney, another in
 business london.
 
“to jane herself,” exclaimed, “there possibility of
 objection,--all loveliness goodness is! understanding
 excellent, mind improved, manners captivating. neither could
 anything urged father, who, though some
 peculiarities, abilities mr. darcy need disdain,

“and mean treat all,” added lydia; “but must lend us the

 bought prettier-coloured satin trim fresh, i
 think will tolerable. besides, will much signify what

“are they, indeed?” cried elizabeth, greatest satisfaction.
 
“they going encamped near brighton; want papa to

“yes,” thought elizabeth; “_that_ delightful scheme, indeed,

“now got news you,” said lydia, sat to

“and mary king safe!” added elizabeth; “safe connection

“she great fool going away, liked him.”
 
“but hope strong attachment either side,” said jane.
 
“i sure _his_. will answer it, never cared

miss bennet’s astonishment soon lessened strong sisterly
 partiality made admiration elizabeth appear perfectly
 natural; surprise shortly lost feelings. was
 sorry mr. darcy delivered sentiments manner so
 little suited recommend them; still grieved the
 unhappiness sister’s refusal must given him.
 
“his sure succeeding wrong,” said she, “and certainly

“indeed,” replied elizabeth, “i heartily sorry him; has

 blame me, however, refusing him?”
 
“blame you! oh, no.”
 
“but blame spoken warmly wickham?”
 
“no--i know wrong saying did.”
 
“but _will_ know it, told happened very

“i know shocked,” said she. “wickham so

 knowledge ill opinion too! relate a

“oh no, regret compassion done away seeing full

“poor wickham! expression goodness his

“there certainly great mismanagement education those

“i never thought mr. darcy deficient _appearance_ you

“and yet meant uncommonly clever taking decided dislike

“lizzy, first read letter, sure treat

“indeed, not. uncomfortable enough, very

“how unfortunate used strong expressions

“certainly. misfortune speaking bitterness most

miss bennet paused little, replied, “surely can no

“that attempted. mr. darcy authorized to

“you quite right. errors made public might ruin for

tumult elizabeth’s mind allayed conversation. she
 got rid two secrets weighed a
 fortnight, certain willing listener jane, whenever she
 might wish talk either. still something
 lurking behind, prudence forbade disclosure. dared not
 relate half mr. darcy’s letter, explain sister

 perfect understanding parties justify in
 throwing last encumbrance mystery. “and then,” said she, “if

“well, lizzy,” said mrs. bennet, one day, “what opinion _now_ of

“he perfectly well-behaved, polite, unassuming,” said uncle.

“but perhaps may little whimsical civilities,” replied

 successively entered world, yet come; mrs.
 bennet, many years lydia’s birth, certain he

 husband’s love independence alone prevented exceeding their

five thousand pounds settled marriage articles mrs. bennet and
 children. proportions divided amongst the

 regard lydia least, now settled, mr. bennet

 mother’s hands, lydia’s expenses little within

done trifling exertion side, too, was
 another welcome surprise; chief wish present have
 little trouble business possible. first transports
 rage produced activity seeking over, he
 naturally returned former indolence. letter soon
 despatched; though dilatory undertaking business, quick in
 execution. begged know particulars was
 indebted brother; angry lydia send any
 message her.
 
good news quickly spread house; proportionate
 speed neighbourhood. borne latter decent

 happiest alternative, secluded world distant

 good-natured wishes well-doing, proceeded from
 spiteful old ladies meryton, lost little spirit

 considered certain.
 
fortnight since mrs. bennet stairs, this
 happy day took seat head table, in

 accomplishment, thoughts words ran wholly those

“haye park might do,” said she, “if gouldings quit it, the
 great house stoke, drawing-room larger; ashworth is
 far off. bear ten miles me; for
 purvis lodge, attics dreadful.”
 
husband allowed talk without interruption the
 servants remained. withdrawn, said her, “mrs.
 bennet, take any, houses, and
 daughter, let us come right understanding. _one_ house this
 neighbourhood shall never admittance. will encourage the
 imprudence either, receiving longbourn.”
 
long dispute followed declaration; mr. bennet firm: it
 soon led another; mrs. bennet found, amazement horror,

 affection whatever occasion. mrs. bennet hardly comprehend
 it. anger carried point inconceivable
 resentment refuse daughter privilege, without her
 marriage scarcely seem valid, exceeded believe

mr. gardiner soon wrote brother. mr. bennet’s
 acknowledgments briefly replied, assurances eagerness to

 welcomed rapture; gave hand affectionate smile to
 wickham, followed lady; wished joy, an
 alacrity showed doubt happiness.

 cordial. countenance rather gained austerity; scarcely
 opened lips. easy assurance young couple, indeed, was
 enough provoke him.
 
elizabeth disgusted, even miss bennet shocked. lydia was
 lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, fearless. turned
 sister sister, demanding congratulations; at
 length sat down, looked eagerly round room, took notice of

wickham distressed herself; manners
 always pleasing, that, character marriage been

 claimed relationship, delighted all. elizabeth
 believed quite equal assurance; sat
 down, resolving within draw limits future the

“only think three months,” cried, “since went away:

 enough happened time. good gracious! went away, sure
 idea married till came back again! though i
 thought good fun was.”
 
father lifted eyes, jane distressed, elizabeth looked
 expressively lydia; she, never heard saw anything of

“oh, mamma, people hereabouts know married to-day? was
 afraid might not; overtook william goulding curricle,
 determined know it, let side glass

elizabeth bear longer. got ran room;
 returned more, till heard passing hall to

 anxious parade, walk mother’s right hand, hear say to

“ah, jane, take place now, must go lower, a

 wholly free first. ease good
 spirits increased. longed see mrs. philips, lucases, all
 neighbours, hear called “mrs. wickham” by
 them; meantime went dinner show ring

“well, mamma,” said she, returned the

“very true; will should. but, dear lydia, don’t

“oh, lord! yes; nothing that. shall like things.

“i like beyond anything!” said mother.
 
“and go away, may leave one two sisters

“i thank share favour,” said elizabeth; “but not
 particularly like way getting husbands.”
 
visitors remain ten days them. mr. wickham
 received commission left london, join
 regiment end fortnight.
 
one mrs. bennet regretted stay short; and
 made time visiting daughter, and
 frequent parties home. parties acceptable to
 all; avoid family circle even desirable did
 think not.
 
wickham’s affection lydia just elizabeth expected to
 find it; equal lydia’s him. scarcely needed her

“mr. darcy!” repeated elizabeth, utter amazement.
 
“oh, yes! come wickham, know. but, gracious me!
 quite forgot! said word it. promised

“if secret,” said jane, “say another word the

“oh, certainly,” said elizabeth, though burning curiosity; “we will
 ask questions.”
 
“thank you,” said lydia; “for did, certainly tell you

mr. wickham perfectly satisfied conversation, he
 never distressed himself, provoked dear sister elizabeth,
 introducing subject it; pleased find she
 said enough keep quiet.
 
day lydia’s departure soon came; mrs. bennet was
 forced submit separation, which, husband means
 entered scheme going newcastle, likely to
 continue least twelvemonth.
 
“oh, dear lydia,” cried, “when shall meet again?”
 
“oh, lord! don’t know. two three years, perhaps.”
 
“write often, dear.”
 
“as often can. know married women never much time for
 writing. sisters may write _me_. will nothing else to
 do.”
 
mr. wickham’s adieus much affectionate wife’s. he
 smiled, looked handsome, said many pretty things.
 
“he fine fellow,” said mr. bennet, soon of
 house, “as ever saw. simpers, smirks, makes love us
 all. prodigiously proud him. defy even sir william lucas
 produce valuable son-in-law.”
 
loss daughter made mrs. bennet dull several days.
 
“i often think,” said she, “that nothing bad parting with
 one’s friends. one seems forlorn without them.”
 
“this consequence, see, madam, marrying daughter,” said
 elizabeth. “it must make better satisfied four are
 single.”
 
“it thing. lydia leave married;
 husband’s regiment happens far off. if
 nearer, gone soon.”
 
spiritless condition event threw shortly
 relieved, mind opened agitation hope, an
 article news began circulation. housekeeper
 netherfield received orders prepare arrival her
 master, coming day two, shoot several
 weeks. mrs. bennet quite fidgets. looked jane, and
 smiled, shook head, turns.
 
“well, well, mr. bingley coming down, sister,” (for mrs.
 philips first brought news). “well, much better. that
 care it, though. nothing us, know, sure i
 never want see again. but, however, welcome come to
 netherfield, likes it. knows _may_ happen? that
 nothing us. know, sister, agreed long ago never mention
 word it. so, quite certain coming?”
 
“you may depend it,” replied other, “for mrs. nichols in
 meryton last night: saw passing by, went purpose
 know truth it; told certainly true. he
 comes thursday, latest, likely wednesday. was
 going butcher’s, told me, purpose order meat on
 wednesday, got three couple ducks just fit killed.”
 
miss bennet able hear coming without changing
 colour. many months since mentioned name to
 elizabeth; now, soon alone together, said,--
 
“i saw look to-day, lizzy, aunt told us present
 report; know appeared distressed; don’t imagine from
 silly cause. confused moment, felt that
 _should_ looked at. assure news affect
 either pleasure pain. glad one thing, comes
 alone; shall see less him. afraid of
 _myself_, dread people’s remarks.”
 
elizabeth know make it. seen in
 derbyshire, might supposed capable coming no
 view acknowledged; still thought partial
 jane, wavered greater probability coming
 _with_ friend’s permission, bold enough come
 without it.
 
“yet hard,” sometimes thought, “that poor man come
 house, legally hired, without raising this
 speculation! _will_ leave himself.”
 
spite sister declared, really believed her
 feelings, expectation arrival, elizabeth easily
 perceive spirits affected it. disturbed,
 unequal, often seen them.
 
subject warmly canvassed parents,
 twelvemonth ago, now brought forward again.
 
“as soon ever mr. bingley comes, dear,” said mrs. bennet, “you
 will wait him, course.”
 
“no, no. forced visiting last year, promised, i
 went see him, marry one daughters. ended in
 nothing, will sent fool’s errand again.”
 
wife represented absolutely necessary attention
 neighbouring gentlemen, returning to
 netherfield.
 
“’tis _etiquette_ despise,” said he. “if wants society, let
 seek it. knows live. will spend _my_ hours in
 running neighbours every time go away come back
 again.”
 
“well, know is, will abominably rude wait
 him. but, however, shan’t prevent asking dine here, i
 determined. must mrs. long gouldings soon. will
 make thirteen ourselves, will just room table for
 him.”
 
consoled resolution, better able bear her
 husband’s incivility; though mortifying know her
 neighbours might see mr. bingley, consequence it, before
 _they_ did. day arrival drew near,--
 
“i begin sorry comes all,” said jane sister. “it
 nothing; see perfect indifference; can
 hardly bear hear thus perpetually talked of. mother means well;
 know, one can know, much suffer she
 says. happy shall stay netherfield over!”
 
“i wish say anything comfort you,” replied elizabeth; “but it
 wholly power. must feel it; usual satisfaction
 preaching patience sufferer denied me, have
 always much.”
 
mr. bingley arrived. mrs. bennet, assistance servants,
 contrived earliest tidings it, period anxiety
 fretfulness side long could. counted days
 must intervene invitation sent--hopeless of
 seeing before. third morning arrival in
 hertfordshire, saw dressing-room window enter the
 paddock, ride towards house.
 
daughters eagerly called partake joy. jane resolutely
 kept place table; elizabeth, satisfy mother, went
 window--she looked--she saw mr. darcy him, sat down
 sister.
 
“there gentleman him, mamma,” said kitty; “who can be?”
 
“some acquaintance other, dear, suppose; sure not
 know.”
 
“la!” replied kitty, “it looks just like man used with
 before. mr. what’s name--that tall, proud man.”
 
“good gracious! mr. darcy!--and does, vow. well, friend of
 mr. bingley’s will always welcome here, sure; else must
 say hate sight him.”
 
jane looked elizabeth surprise concern. knew little
 meeting derbyshire, therefore felt awkwardness
 must attend sister, seeing almost first time
 receiving explanatory letter. sisters uncomfortable
 enough. felt other, course themselves; their
 mother talked dislike mr. darcy, resolution be
 civil mr. bingley’s friend, without heard either
 them. elizabeth sources uneasiness yet be
 suspected jane, never yet courage show mrs.
 gardiner’s letter, relate change sentiment towards
 him. jane, man whose proposals refused,
 whose merits undervalued; extensive
 information, person whole family indebted
 first benefits, regarded an
 interest, quite tender, least reasonable just, as
 jane felt bingley. astonishment coming--at his
 coming netherfield, longbourn, voluntarily seeking again,
 almost equal known first witnessing altered
 behaviour derbyshire.
 
colour driven face returned half a
 minute additional glow, smile delight added lustre to
 eyes, thought space time affection and
 wishes must still unshaken; secure.
 
“let first see behaves,” said she; “it will early
 enough expectation.”
 
sat intently work, striving composed, without daring to
 lift eyes, till anxious curiosity carried face her
 sister servant approaching door. jane looked little
 paler usual, sedate elizabeth expected. the
 gentlemen’s appearing, colour increased; yet received with
 tolerable ease, propriety behaviour equally free any
 symptom resentment, unnecessary complaisance.
 
elizabeth said little either civility allow, sat down
 work, eagerness often command. she
 ventured one glance darcy. looked serious usual; and,
 thought, used look hertfordshire, as
 seen pemberley. but, perhaps, her
 mother’s presence uncle aunt. a
 painful, improbable, conjecture.
 
bingley likewise seen instant, short period
 saw looking pleased embarrassed. received mrs.
 bennet degree civility made two daughters ashamed,
 especially contrasted cold ceremonious politeness of
 courtesy address friend.
 
elizabeth particularly, knew mother owed latter the
 preservation favourite daughter irremediable infamy, was
 hurt distressed painful degree distinction ill
 applied.
 
darcy, inquiring mr. mrs. gardiner did--a question
 answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. he
 seated her: perhaps reason silence; but
 derbyshire. talked friends
 herself. now several minutes elapsed, without
 bringing sound voice; occasionally, unable resist
 impulse curiosity, raised eyes face, often
 found looking jane herself, frequently object but
 ground. thoughtfulness less anxiety please, when
 last met, plainly expressed. disappointed, angry
 so.
 
“could expect otherwise?” said she. “yet come?”
 
humour conversation anyone himself; to
 hardly courage speak.
 
inquired sister, more.
 
“it long time, mr. bingley, since went away,” said mrs. bennet.
 
readily agreed it.
 
“i began afraid never come back again. people _did_ say,
 meant quit place entirely michaelmas; but, however, hope
 true. great many changes happened neighbourhood
 since went away. miss lucas married settled: one my
 daughters. suppose heard it; indeed, must have

bingley replied did, made congratulations. elizabeth
 dared lift eyes. mr. darcy looked, therefore, could
 tell.
 
“it delightful thing, sure, daughter well married,”
 continued mother; “but time, mr. bingley, very
 hard taken away me. gone newcastle, a
 place quite northward seems, stay, not
 know long. regiment there; suppose heard of
 leaving ----shire, gone regulars.
 thank heaven! _some_ friends, though, perhaps, many he
 deserves.”
 
elizabeth, knew levelled mr. darcy, misery
 shame hardly keep seat. drew her, however,
 exertion speaking, nothing else effectually done
 before; asked bingley whether meant make stay the
 country present. weeks, believed.
 
“when killed birds, mr. bingley,” said mother,
 “i beg will come shoot many please mr.
 bennet’s manor. sure will vastly happy oblige you, and
 will save best coveys you.”
 
elizabeth’s misery increased unnecessary, officious
 attention! fair prospect arise present, had
 flattered year ago, everything, persuaded, be
 hastening vexatious conclusion. instant felt,
 years happiness make jane amends for
 moments painful confusion.
 
“the first wish heart,” said herself, “is never be
 company either them. society can afford pleasure
 will atone wretchedness this! let never see either
 one again!”
 
yet misery, years happiness offer no
 compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, observing
 much beauty sister rekindled admiration former
 lover. first came in, spoken little, every
 five minutes seemed giving attention. found her
 handsome last year; good-natured, as
 unaffected, though quite chatty. jane anxious no
 difference perceived all, really persuaded
 talked much ever; mind busily engaged,
 always know silent.
 
gentlemen rose go away, mrs. bennet mindful her
 intended civility, invited engaged dine at
 longbourn days’ time.
 
“you quite visit debt, mr. bingley,” added; “for when
 went town last winter, promised take family dinner with
 us soon returned. forgot, see; assure you
 much disappointed come back keep your
 engagement.”
 
bingley looked little silly reflection, said something of
 concern prevented business. went away.
 
mrs. bennet strongly inclined ask stay dine
 day; but, though always kept good table, did
 think anything less two courses good enough man
 anxious designs, satisfy appetite pride

soon gone, elizabeth walked recover spirits;
 or, words, dwell without interruption subjects
 must deaden more. mr. darcy’s behaviour astonished vexed
 her.
 
“why, came silent, grave, indifferent,” said she,
 “did come all?”
 
settle way gave pleasure.
 
“he still amiable, still pleasing uncle aunt, he

 longer cares me, silent? teasing, teasing man! will think
 him.”
 
resolution short time involuntarily kept approach
 sister, joined cheerful look showed her
 better satisfied visitors elizabeth.
 
“now,” said she, “that first meeting over, feel perfectly
 easy. know strength, shall never embarrassed by
 coming. glad dines tuesday. will publicly
 seen, sides meet common indifferent
 acquaintance.”
 
“yes, indifferent, indeed,” said elizabeth, laughingly. “oh, jane!
 take care.”
 
“my dear lizzy, think weak danger now.”
 
“i think great danger making much love with
 ever.”
 
see gentlemen till tuesday; mrs. bennet, in
 meanwhile, giving way happy schemes the
 good-humour common politeness bingley, half hour’s visit,
 revived.
 
tuesday large party assembled longbourn; two
 anxiously expected, credit punctuality as
 sportsmen, good time. repaired the
 dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched see whether bingley take
 place which, former parties, belonged him, by
 sister. prudent mother, occupied ideas, forbore to
 invite sit herself. entering room, seemed to
 hesitate; jane happened look round, happened smile: was
 decided. placed her.
 
elizabeth, triumphant sensation, looked towards friend. he
 bore noble indifference; imagined that
 bingley received sanction happy, seen eyes
 likewise turned towards mr. darcy, expression half-laughing
 alarm.
 
behaviour sister dinnertime showed an
 admiration her, which, though guarded formerly, persuaded
 elizabeth, that, left wholly himself, jane’s happiness, his
 own, speedily secured. though dared depend upon the
 consequence, yet received pleasure observing behaviour. it
 gave animation spirits boast; in
 cheerful humour. mr. darcy almost far table
 divide them. one side mother. knew little

 see seldom spoke other, formal and
 cold manner whenever did. mother’s ungraciousness
 made sense owed painful elizabeth’s mind;
 would, times, given anything privileged tell
 him, kindness neither unknown unfelt whole of
 family.
 
hopes evening afford opportunity of
 bringing together; whole visit pass away
 without enabling enter something conversation,
 mere ceremonious salutation attending entrance. anxious and
 uneasy, period passed drawing-room gentlemen
 came, wearisome dull degree almost made uncivil.
 looked forward entrance point her
 chance pleasure evening must depend.
 
“if come me, _then_,” said she, “i shall give for
 ever.”
 
gentlemen came; thought looked have
 answered hopes; but, alas! ladies crowded round table,
 miss bennet making tea, elizabeth pouring coffee,
 close confederacy, single vacancy near her
 admit chair. gentlemen’s approaching, one of
 girls moved closer ever, said, whisper,--
 
“the men shan’t come part us, determined. want none them;
 we?”
 
darcy walked away another part room. followed with
 eyes, envied everyone spoke, scarcely patience enough
 help anybody coffee, enraged for
 silly!
 
“a man refused! ever foolish enough to
 expect renewal love? one among sex not

 indignity abhorrent feelings.”
 
little revived, however, bringing back coffee-cup
 himself; seized opportunity saying,--
 
“is sister pemberley still?”
 
“yes; will remain till christmas.”
 
“and quite alone? friends left her?”
 
“mrs. annesley her. others gone scarborough
 three weeks.”
 
think nothing say; wished converse
 her, might better success. stood her, however, for
 minutes, silence; and, last, young lady’s whispering
 elizabeth again, walked away.
 
tea things removed, card tables placed, ladies
 rose; elizabeth hoping soon joined him, when
 views overthrown, seeing fall victim her
 mother’s rapacity whist players, moments seated
 rest party. now lost every expectation pleasure.
 confined evening different tables; had
 nothing hope, eyes often turned towards side
 room, make play unsuccessfully herself.
 
mrs. bennet designed keep two netherfield gentlemen to
 supper; carriage was, unluckily, ordered the
 others, opportunity detaining them.
 
“well, girls,” said she, soon left themselves, “what
 say day? think everything passed uncommonly well, i
 assure you. dinner well dressed ever saw. the
 venison roasted turn--and everybody said, never saw fat
 haunch. soup fifty times better the
 lucases’ last week; even mr. darcy acknowledged partridges
 remarkably well done; suppose two three french
 cooks least. and, dear jane, never saw look greater
 beauty. mrs. long said too, asked whether not. and
 think said besides? ‘ah! mrs. bennet, shall her
 netherfield last!’ did, indeed. think mrs. long as
 good creature ever lived--and nieces pretty behaved

mrs. bennet, short, great spirits: seen enough of
 bingley’s behaviour jane convinced get at

 humour, far beyond reason, quite disappointed at
 seeing next day, make proposals.
 
“it agreeable day,” said miss bennet elizabeth. “the
 party seemed well selected, suitable one other. hope we
 may often meet again.”
 
elizabeth smiled.
 
“lizzy, must so. must suspect me. mortifies me. i

“how hard cases believed! impossible in

“nothing, child, nothing. wink you.” sat still

 suddenly got up, saying kitty,--
 
“come here, love, want speak you,” took room.
 jane instantly gave look elizabeth spoke distress such

 coolly, “will rather confirmation it--if, indeed, report

“if! pretend ignorant it? been

“i never heard was.”
 
“and can likewise declare, _foundation_ it?”

“whatever connections may be,” said elizabeth, “if nephew does

“tell me, all, engaged him?”
 
though elizabeth not, mere purpose obliging lady
 catherine, answered question, say, a

“i not.”
 
lady catherine seemed pleased.
 
“and will promise never enter engagement?”
 
“i will make promise kind.”

discomposure spirits extraordinary visit threw
 elizabeth easily overcome; many
 hours learn think less incessantly. lady catherine, it
 appeared, actually taken trouble journey rosings

 till recollected _his_ intimate friend bingley,
 _her_ sister jane, enough, time the

 idea. forgotten feel marriage her
 sister must bring frequently together. neighbours at
 lucas lodge, therefore, (for communication the
 collinses, report, concluded, reached lady catherine,) had
 set _that_ almost certain immediate _she_ had
 looked forward possible future time.
 
revolving lady catherine’s expressions, however, help
 feeling uneasiness possible consequence persisting
 interference. said resolution to
 prevent marriage, occurred elizabeth must meditate an
 application nephew; might take similar
 representation evils attached connection dared

 thought much higher ladyship _she_ do; it
 certain, enumerating miseries marriage _one_

 seemed likely, advice entreaty near relation might

 catherine might see way town; engagement to

“if, therefore, excuse keeping promise come his

 constancy. satisfied regretting me, might
 obtained affections hand, shall soon cease regret him
 all.”
 
surprise rest family, hearing visitor had
 been, great: obligingly satisfied same
 kind supposition appeased mrs. bennet’s curiosity; and
 elizabeth spared much teasing subject.
 
next morning, going stairs, met her
 father, came library letter hand.
 
“lizzy,” said he, “i going look you: come room.”
 
followed thither; curiosity know tell

 consequent explanations.
 
followed father fireplace, sat down. he
 said,--
 
“i received letter morning astonished me
 exceedingly. principally concerns yourself, know its
 contents. know _two_ daughters brink

colour now rushed elizabeth’s cheeks instantaneous

 undetermined whether pleased explained
 all, offended letter rather addressed to

“you look conscious. young ladies great penetration matters

“from mr. collins! can _he_ say?”
 
“something much purpose, course. begins with

 ‘this young gentleman blessed, peculiar way, everything the

elizabeth tried join father’s pleasantry, force
 one reluctant smile. never wit directed manner so
 little agreeable her.
 
“are diverted?”
 
“oh, yes. pray read on.”
 
“‘after mentioning likelihood marriage ladyship last

“oh,” cried elizabeth, “i exceedingly diverted. so

“yes, _that_ makes amusing. fixed man

question daughter replied laugh; had
 asked without least suspicion, distressed his
 repeating it. elizabeth never loss make her

 rather cried. father cruelly mortified by
 said mr. darcy’s indifference; nothing but
 wonder want penetration, fear that, perhaps, instead of
 seeing _little_, might fancied _much_.

instead receiving letter excuse friend, as
 elizabeth half expected mr. bingley do, able bring darcy
 longbourn many days passed lady catherine’s
 visit. gentlemen arrived early; and, mrs. bennet time to
 tell seen aunt, daughter sat in
 momentary dread, bingley, wanted alone jane, proposed
 walking out. agreed to. mrs. bennet the
 habit walking, mary never spare time, remaining five
 set together. bingley jane, however, soon allowed others to
 outstrip them. lagged behind, elizabeth, kitty, darcy
 entertain other. little said either; kitty was
 much afraid talk; elizabeth secretly forming a
 desperate resolution; and, perhaps, might same.
 
walked towards lucases’, kitty wished call upon
 maria; elizabeth saw occasion making general concern,
 kitty left went boldly alone. now the
 moment resolution executed; courage was
 high, immediately said,--
 
“mr. darcy, selfish creature, sake giving
 relief feelings care much may wounding yours. i
 can longer help thanking unexampled kindness poor
 sister. ever since known anxious to
 acknowledge gratefully feel it. known rest
 family merely gratitude express.”
 
“i sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied darcy, tone surprise
 emotion, “that ever informed may, a
 mistaken light, given uneasiness. think mrs. gardiner
 little trusted.”
 
“you must blame aunt. lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
 concerned matter; and, course, could
 rest till knew particulars. let thank again,
 name family, generous compassion induced
 take much trouble, bear many mortifications, the
 sake discovering them.”
 
“if _will_ thank me,” replied, “let alone.
 wish giving happiness might add force other
 inducements led on, shall attempt deny. your
 _family_ owe nothing. much respect them, believe thought
 _you_.”
 
elizabeth much embarrassed say word. short pause,
 companion added, “you generous trifle me. your
 feelings still last april, tell once. _my_
 affections wishes unchanged; one word will silence
 subject ever.”
 
elizabeth, feeling common awkwardness anxiety of
 situation, now forced speak; immediately, though not
 fluently, gave understand sentiments undergone
 material change since period alluded, make
 receive gratitude pleasure present assurances. the
 happiness reply produced probably never
 felt before; expressed occasion sensibly as
 warmly man violently love can supposed do. elizabeth
 able encounter eyes, might seen well the
 expression heartfelt delight diffused face became him: but
 though look listen; told feelings
 which, proving importance him, made affection

 ladyship, effect exactly contrariwise.
 
“it taught hope,” said he, “as scarcely ever allowed myself
 hope before. knew enough disposition certain, that
 absolutely, irrevocably decided me, have
 acknowledged lady catherine frankly openly.”
 
elizabeth coloured laughed replied, “yes, know enough of
 _frankness_ believe capable _that_. abusing so
 abominably face, scruple abusing all
 relations.”
 
“what say deserve? though your
 accusations ill-founded, formed mistaken premises, behaviour

 unpardonable. think without abhorrence.”
 
“we will quarrel greater share blame annexed that
 evening,” said elizabeth. “the conduct neither, strictly
 examined, will irreproachable; since both, hope,
 improved civility.”
 
“i easily reconciled myself. recollection i

 confess, reasonable enough allow justice.”
 
“i certainly far expecting make strong an

“i can easily believe it. thought devoid every proper

“oh, repeat said. recollections will at

darcy mentioned letter. “did it,” said he,--“did _soon_ make you
 think better me? you, reading it, give credit its
 contents?”
 
explained effects been, gradually all
 former prejudices removed.
 
“i knew,” said he, “that wrote must give pain, was
 necessary. hope destroyed letter. one part,
 especially opening it, dread power

“the letter shall certainly burnt, believe essential the
 preservation regard; but, though reason think my
 opinions entirely unalterable, not, hope, quite easily

“when wrote letter,” replied darcy, “i believed perfectly

“the letter, perhaps, began bitterness, end so. the

evening passed quietly, unmarked anything extraordinary. the
 acknowledged lovers talked laughed; unacknowledged silent.
 darcy disposition happiness overflows mirth;
 elizabeth, agitated confused, rather _knew_ happy
 _felt_ so; for, besides immediate embarrassment,
 evils her. anticipated felt in
 family situation became known: aware one
 liked jane; even feared others a
 _dislike_ fortune consequence might away.
 
night opened heart jane. though suspicion far

“you joking, lizzy. be! engaged mr. darcy! no, no,
 shall deceive me: know impossible.”
 
“this wretched beginning, indeed! sole dependence you;
 sure nobody else will believe me, not. yet, indeed, i
 earnest. speak nothing truth. still loves me, we
 engaged.”
 
jane looked doubtingly. “oh, lizzy! be. know much

“you know nothing matter. _that_ forgot. perhaps i
 always love well now; cases these

 remember myself.”
 
miss bennet still looked amazement. elizabeth again, more
 seriously, assured truth.
 
“good heaven! can really so? yet now must believe you,” cried
 jane. “my dear, dear lizzy, would, congratulate you; you
 certain--forgive question--are quite certain can be
 happy him?”
 
“there can doubt that. settled us already we

“very, much. nothing give either bingley more

“oh, yes! will think feel _more_ i

“what mean?”
 
“why, must confess love better bingley. am
 afraid will angry.”
 
“my dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. want talk seriously.
 let know everything know without delay. will tell me

“it coming gradually, hardly know began;
 believe must date first seeing beautiful grounds

another entreaty serious, however, produced the
 desired effect; soon satisfied jane solemn assurances of
 attachment. convinced article, miss bennet nothing

“now quite happy,” said she, “for will happy myself. i
 always value him. nothing love you, i
 must always esteemed him; now, bingley’s friend your
 husband, can bingley dear me. but,
 lizzy, sly, reserved me. little you

elizabeth told motives secrecy. unwilling to
 mention bingley; unsettled state feelings made
 equally avoid name friend: now longer
 conceal share lydia’s marriage. acknowledged,
 half night spent conversation.
 
“good gracious!” cried mrs. bennet, stood window next
 morning, “if disagreeable mr. darcy coming with
 dear bingley! can mean tiresome always
 coming here? notion go a-shooting, something or
 other, disturb us company. shall him?
 lizzy, must walk again, may bingley’s
 way.”
 
elizabeth hardly help laughing convenient proposal; yet
 really vexed mother always giving an
 epithet.
 
soon entered, bingley looked expressively, and
 shook hands warmth, left doubt good information;
 soon afterwards said aloud, “mrs. bennet, lanes
 hereabouts lizzy may lose way to-day?”
 
“i advise mr. darcy, lizzy, kitty,” said mrs. bennet, “to walk
 oakham mount morning. nice long walk, mr. darcy has
 never seen view.”
 
“it may well others,” replied mr. bingley; “but am
 sure will much kitty. won’t it, kitty?”
 
kitty owned rather stay home. darcy professed great
 curiosity see view mount, elizabeth silently
 consented. went upstairs get ready, mrs. bennet followed her,
 saying,--
 
“i quite sorry, lizzy, forced that
 disagreeable man yourself; hope will mind it. is
 jane’s sake, know; occasion talking to
 except just now then; put inconvenience.”
 
walk, resolved mr. bennet’s consent be

 certain manner equally ill adapted credit to

evening, soon mr. bennet withdrew library, saw
 mr. darcy rise also follow him, agitation seeing was
 extreme. fear father’s opposition, going to
 made unhappy, means; _she_,
 favourite child, distressing choice, be
 filling fears regrets disposing her, wretched

 looking him, little relieved smile. minutes

 pretending admire work, said whisper, “go father; he
 wants library.” gone directly.
 
father walking room, looking grave anxious.
 “lizzy,” said he, “what doing? senses be

earnestly wish former opinions more

“or, words, determined him. rich, be

“have objection,” said elizabeth, “than belief my
 indifference?”
 
“none all. know proud, unpleasant sort man; but
 nothing really liked him.”
 
“i do, like him,” replied, tears eyes; “i love him.
 indeed improper pride. perfectly amiable. not

“lizzy,” said father, “i given consent. kind

 condescended ask. now give _you_, resolved on

elizabeth, still affected, earnest solemn reply;
 and, length, repeated assurances mr. darcy really the
 object choice, explaining gradual change her
 estimation undergone, relating absolute certainty that
 affection work day, stood test many
 months’ suspense, enumerating energy good qualities,
 conquer father’s incredulity, reconcile the

“well, dear,” said he, ceased speaking, “i to

complete favourable impression, told mr. darcy

“this evening wonders, indeed! so, darcy everything;

 commission! much better. will save world trouble

 paid him; violent young lovers carry everything own
 way. shall offer pay to-morrow, will rant storm about
 love you, will end matter.”
 
recollected embarrassment days reading
 mr. collins’s letter; laughing time, allowed her
 last go, saying, quitted room, “if young men come
 mary kitty, send in, quite leisure.”
 
elizabeth’s mind now relieved heavy weight; and, after
 half hour’s quiet reflection room, able join
 others tolerable composure. everything recent for
 gaiety, evening passed tranquilly away; longer
 anything material dreaded, comfort ease familiarity
 come time.
 
mother went dressing-room night, followed her,
 made important communication. effect extraordinary;
 for, first hearing it, mrs. bennet sat quite still, unable to
 utter syllable. many, many minutes, could
 comprehend heard, though general backward credit what
 advantage family, came shape a
 lover them. began length recover, fidget in
 chair, get up, sit again, wonder, bless herself.
 
“good gracious! lord bless me! think! dear me! mr. darcy! would
 thought it? really true? oh, sweetest lizzy! rich
 great will be! pin-money, jewels, carriages
 will have! jane’s nothing it--nothing all. so

 dear lizzy! pray apologize disliked much before. i
 hope will overlook it. dear, dear lizzy. house town! everything

enough prove approbation need doubted; and
 elizabeth, rejoicing effusion heard herself,
 soon went away. three minutes room,
 mother followed her.
 
“my dearest child,” cried, “i can think nothing else. ten
 thousand year, likely more! ’tis good lord! a
 special licence--you must shall married special licence.
 but, dearest love, tell dish mr. darcy particularly fond
 of, may to-morrow.”
 
sad omen mother’s behaviour gentleman
 might be; elizabeth found that, though certain
 possession warmest affection, secure relations’
 consent, still something wished for. morrow
 passed much better expected; mrs. bennet luckily stood
 awe intended son-in-law, ventured speak
 him, unless power offer attention, mark
 deference opinion.
 
elizabeth satisfaction seeing father taking pains get
 acquainted him; mr. bennet soon assured rising
 every hour esteem.
 
“i admire three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “wickham, perhaps,
 favourite; think shall like _your_ husband quite well

“and letter write myself, might sit you, and
