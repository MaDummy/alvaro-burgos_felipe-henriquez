 must rather consider general bearing whole narrative, than

unfortunate us, that, greatest men, know

scepticism attained culminating point respect homer,
 state homeric knowledge may described free
 permission believe theory, provided throw overboard all
 written tradition, concerning author authors iliad and
 odyssey. authorities exist subject, summarily
 dismissed, although arguments appear run circle. “this
 true, true; and, true, because
 true.” seems style, testimony upon
 testimony, statement upon statement, consigned denial and
 oblivion.
 
is, however, unfortunate professed biographies homer are
 partly forgeries, partly freaks ingenuity imagination, which
 truth requisite wanting. taking brief review of
 homeric theory present conditions, notice must taken
 treatise life homer attributed to
 herodotus.
 
according document, city cumæ Æolia, was, an
 early period, seat frequent immigrations various parts of
 greece. among immigrants menapolus, ithagenes.
 although poor, married, result union girl named
 critheïs. girl left orphan early age, the
 guardianship cleanax, argos. indiscretion this
 maiden “are indebted much happiness.” homer the
 first fruit juvenile frailty, received name of
 melesigenes, born near river meles, bœotia,
 whither critheïs transported order save reputation.
 
“at time,” continues narrative, “there lived smyrna man
 named phemius, teacher literature music, who, being
 married, engaged critheïs manage household, spin flax he
 received price scholastic labours. satisfactory was
 performance task, modest conduct, made
 proposals marriage, declaring himself, inducement,
 willing adopt son, who, asserted, become clever man,
 carefully brought up.”
 
married; careful cultivation ripened talents nature
 bestowed, melesigenes soon surpassed schoolfellows every
 attainment, and, older, rivalled preceptor wisdom. phemius
 died, leaving sole heir property, mother soon
 followed. melesigenes carried adopted father’s school great
 success, exciting admiration inhabitants smyrna,
 also strangers trade carried there, especially
 exportation corn, attracted city. among these
 visitors, one mentes, leucadia, modern santa maura, who
 evinced knowledge intelligence rarely found times,
 persuaded melesigenes close school, accompany his
 travels. promised pay expenses, furnish him
 stipend, urging, that, “while yet young, was
 fitting see eyes countries cities
 might hereafter subjects discourses.” melesigenes
 consented, set patron, “examining curiosities
 countries visited, informing everything by
 interrogating met.” may also suppose, wrote
 memoirs deemed worthy preservation.[2] set
 sail tyrrhenia iberia, reached ithaca. melesigenes,
 already suffered eyes, became much worse, mentes,
 leave leucadia, left medical
 superintendence friend his, named mentor, alcinor.
 hospitable intelligent host, melesigenes rapidly became
 acquainted legends respecting ulysses, afterwards formed
 subject odyssey. inhabitants ithaca assert, it
 melesigenes became blind, colophomans make their
 city seat misfortune. returned smyrna, he
 applied study poetry.[3]
 
poverty soon drove cumæ. passed hermæan
 plain, arrived neon teichos, new wall, colony cumæ.
 misfortunes poetical talent gained friendship of
 one tychias, armourer. “and time,” continued author,
 “the inhabitants showed place used sit giving a
 recitation verses, greatly honoured spot. also
 poplar grew, said sprung ever since melesigenes
 arrived”.[4]
 
poverty still drove on, went way larissa, being
 convenient road. here, cumans say, composed epitaph
 gordius, king phrygia, however, greater
 probability, attributed cleobulus lindus.[5]
 
arrived cumæ, frequented _converzationes_[6] old men,
 delighted charms poetry. encouraged this
 favourable reception, declared that, allow a
 public maintenance, render city gloriously
 renowned. avowed willingness support measure
 proposed, procured audience council. made
 speech, purport author forgotten to
 acquaint us, retired, left debate respecting answer
 given proposal.
 
greater part assembly seemed favourable poet’s
 demand, one man observed “if feed _homers_, they
 encumbered multitude useless people.” “from this
 circumstance,” says writer, “melesigenes acquired name of
 homer, cumans call blind men _homers_.”[7] love of
 economy, shows similar world always its
 treatment literary men, pension denied, poet vented
 disappointment wish cumæa might never produce poet
 capable giving renown glory.
 
phocœa, homer destined experience another literary distress.
 one thestorides, aimed reputation poetical genius, kept
 homer house, allowed pittance, condition the
 verses poet passing name. collected sufficient
 poetry profitable, thestorides, like would-be-literary
 publishers, neglected man whose brains sucked, left him.
 departure, homer said observed: “o thestorides, of
 many things hidden knowledge man, nothing more
 unintelligible human heart.”[8]
 
homer continued career difficulty distress, chian
 merchants, struck similarity verses heard him
 recite, acquainted fact thestorides pursuing a
 profitable livelihood recital poems. at
 determined set chios. vessel happened be
 setting sail thither, found one ready start erythræ, a
 town ionia, faces island, prevailed upon the
 seamen allow accompany them. embarked, invoked a
 favourable wind, prayed might able expose the
 imposture thestorides, who, breach hospitality, drawn
 wrath jove hospitable.
 
erythræ, homer fortunately met person known in
 phocœa, whose assistance length, difficulty,
 reached little hamlet pithys. met adventure,
 will continue words author. “having set from
 pithys, homer went on, attracted cries goats were
 pasturing. dogs barked approach, cried out. glaucus
 (for name goat-herd) heard voice, ran up
 quickly, called dogs, drove away homer. some
 time stood wondering blind man reached a
 place alone, design coming. went to
 him, inquired was, come desolate places
 untrodden spots, stood need. homer, recounting
 whole history misfortunes, moved compassion;
 took him, led cot, lit fire, bade
 sup.[9]
 
“the dogs, instead eating, kept barking stranger, according
 usual habit. whereupon homer addressed glaucus thus: o
 glaucus, friend, prythee attend behest. first give dogs
 supper doors hut: better, since,
 whilst watch, thief wild beast will approach fold.
 
glaucus pleased advice, marvelled author.
 finished supper, banqueted[10] afresh conversation,
 homer narrating wanderings, telling cities had
 visited.
 
length retired rest; following morning, glaucus
 resolved go master, acquaint meeting with
 homer. left goats charge fellow-servant, left
 homer home, promising return quickly. arrived bolissus,
 place near farm, finding mate, told whole
 story respecting homer journey. paid little attention to
 said, blamed glaucus stupidity taking and
 feeding maimed enfeebled persons. however, bade bring the
 stranger him.
 
glaucus told homer taken place, bade follow him,
 assuring good fortune result. conversation soon
 showed stranger man much cleverness general
 knowledge, chian persuaded remain, undertake the
 charge children.[11]
 
besides satisfaction driving impostor thestorides the
 island, homer enjoyed considerable success teacher. town of
 chios established school taught precepts poetry.
 “to day,” says chandler,[12] “the curious remaining that
 named, without reason, school homer. the
 coast, distance city, northward, appears have
 open temple cybele, formed top rock. shape
 oval, centre image goddess, head an
 arm wanting. represented, usual, sitting. chair a
 lion carved side, back. area bounded low
 rim, seat, five yards over. whole hewn the
 mountain, rude, indistinct, probably remote
 antiquity.”
 
successful school, homer realised considerable
 fortune. married, two daughters, one died single,
 married chian.
 
following passage betrays tendency connect the
 personages poems history poet, already
 mentioned:—
 
“in poetical compositions homer displays great gratitude towards
 mentor ithaca, odyssey, whose name inserted his
 poem companion ulysses,[13] return care taken of
 afflicted blindness. also testifies gratitude to
 phemius, given sustenance instruction.”
 
celebrity continued increase, many persons advised to
 visit greece, whither reputation now extended. having, is
 said, made additions poems calculated please vanity
 athenians, whose city hitherto made mention,[14] he
 sent samos. recognized samian, met with
 chios, handsomely received, invited join in
 celebrating apaturian festival. recited verses, gave
 great satisfaction, singing eiresione new moon
 festivals, earned subsistence, visiting houses rich,
 whose children popular.
 
spring sailed athens, arrived island ios,
 now ino, fell extremely ill, died. said his
 death arose vexation, able unravel enigma
 proposed fishermen’s children.[15]
 
is, brief, substance earliest life homer we
 possess, broad evidences historical
 worthlessness, scarcely necessary point in
 detail. let us now consider opinions a
 persevering, patient, learned—but means consistent—series of
 investigations led. so, profess bring forward
 statements, vouch reasonableness probability.
 
“homer appeared. history poet works lost in
 doubtful obscurity, history many first minds who
 done honour humanity, rose amidst darkness. the
 majestic stream song, blessing fertilizing, flows like the
 nile, many lands nations; and, like sources the
 nile, fountains will ever remain concealed.”
 
words one judicious german critics
 eloquently described uncertainty whole the
 homeric question involved. less truth feeling he
 proceeds:—
 
“it seems chief importance expect nature of
 things makes possible. period tradition history the
 region twilight, expect perfect light. the
 creations genius always seem like miracles, are, for
 part, created far reach observation. were
 possession historical testimonies, never wholly
 explain origin iliad odyssey; origin, in
 essential points, must remained secret poet.”[16]
 
criticism, shows much insight depths of
 human nature minute wire-drawings scholastic
 investigation, let us pass main question issue. homer
 individual?[17] iliad odyssey result an
 ingenious arrangement fragments earlier poets?
 
well landor remarked: “some tell us twenty homers; some
 deny ever one. idle foolish shake the
 contents vase, order let settle last. are
 perpetually labouring destroy delights, composure, our
 devotion superior power. animals earth least know
 good us. opinion is, best us our
 admiration good. man living venerates homer do.”[18]
 
but, greatly admire generous enthusiasm rests contented
 poetry best impulses nurtured and
 fostered, without seeking destroy vividness first impressions
 minute analysis—our editorial office compels us give some
 attention doubts difficulties homeric
 question beset, entreat reader, brief period, to
 prefer judgment imagination, condescend dry
 details.
 
before, however, entering particulars respecting question of
 unity homeric poems, (at least iliad,) must
 express sympathy sentiments expressed following
 remarks:—
 
“we think universal admiration unity the
 better, poetic age greece, almost conclusive testimony its
 original composition. till age grammarians that
 primitive integrity called question; injustice to
 assert, minute analytical spirit grammarian not
 best qualification profound feeling, comprehensive
 conception harmonious whole. exquisite anatomist may be
 judge symmetry human frame: take the
 opinion chantrey westmacott proportions general beauty
 form, rather mr. brodie sir astley cooper.
 
“there truth, though malicious exaggeration, lines
 pope.—
 
“‘the critic eye—that microscope wit
 sees hairs pores, examines bit bit,
 parts relate parts, whole,
 body’s harmony, beaming soul,
 things kuster, burmann, wasse, shall see,
 man’s whole frame obvious flea.’”[19]
 

long time elapsed one dreamt questioning
 unity authorship homeric poems. grave and
 cautious thucydides quoted without hesitation hymn apollo,[20]
 authenticity already disclaimed modern
 critics. longinus, oft quoted passage, merely expressed an
 opinion touching comparative inferiority odyssey the
 iliad,[21] and, among mass ancient authors, whose names[22]
 tedious detail, suspicion personal
 non-existence homer ever arose. far, voice antiquity seems
 favour early ideas subject; let us now see what
 discoveries modern investigations lay claim.
 
end seventeenth century, doubts begun awaken on
 subject, find bentley remarking “homer wrote sequel
 songs rhapsodies, sung himself, small comings and
 good cheer, festivals days merriment. loose songs
 collected together, form epic poem, till about
 peisistratus’ time, five hundred years after.”[23]
 
two french writers—hedelin perrault—avowed similar scepticism on
 subject; “scienza nuova” battista vico, we
 first meet germ theory, subsequently defended wolf
 much learning acuteness. indeed, wolfian
 theory chiefly deal, following bold
 hypothesis, will detail words grote:—[24]
 
“half century ago, acute valuable prolegomena f. a. wolf,
 turning account venetian scholia, recently
 published, first opened philosophical discussion history of
 homeric text. considerable part dissertation (though by
 means whole) employed vindicating position, previously
 announced bentley, amongst others, separate constituent
 portions iliad odyssey cemented together into
 compact body unchangeable order, days of
 peisistratus, sixth century christ. step towards
 conclusion, wolf maintained written copies either poem
 shown existed earlier times, their
 composition referred; without writing, neither perfect
 symmetry complicated work originally conceived
 poet, nor, realized him, transmitted assurance to
 posterity. absence easy convenient writing, must be
 indispensably supposed long manuscripts, among early greeks,
 thus one points wolf’s case primitive
 integrity iliad odyssey. nitzsch, leading
 opponents wolf, connection one seems to
 accepted originally put it; considered
 incumbent defended ancient aggregate character the
 iliad odyssey, maintain written poems the
 beginning.
 
“to appears, architectonic functions ascribed wolf to
 peisistratus associates, reference homeric poems, are
 nowise admissible. much undoubtedly gained towards that
 view question, shown, that, order to
 controvert it, driven necessity admitting long
 written poems, ninth century christian æra. few
 things, opinion, can improbable; mr. payne knight,
 opposed wolfian hypothesis, admits less than
 wolf himself. traces writing greece, even seventh
 century christian æra, exceedingly trifling. no
 remaining inscription earlier fortieth olympiad, early
 inscriptions rude unskilfully executed; can even assure
 whether archilochus, simonidês amorgus, kallinus,
 tyrtæus, xanthus, early elegiac lyric poets,
 committed compositions writing, time practice
 became familiar. first positive ground authorizes
 us presume existence manuscript homer, famous
 ordinance solôn, regard rhapsodies panathenæa:
 length time previously manuscripts existed, are
 unable say.
 
“those maintain homeric poems written the
 beginning, rest case, upon positive proofs, yet upon the
 existing habits society regard poetry—for admit
 generally iliad odyssey read, recited and
 heard,—but upon supposed necessity must been
 manuscripts ensure preservation poems—the unassisted
 memory reciters neither sufficient trustworthy. here
 escape smaller difficulty running greater; the
 existence trained bards, gifted extraordinary memory,[25] is
 far less astonishing long manuscripts, age
 essentially non-reading non-writing, even suitable
 instruments materials process obvious. moreover,
 strong positive reason believing bard under
 necessity refreshing memory consulting manuscript; for
 fact, blindness disqualification
 profession, know not, well the
 example demodokus, odyssey, blind bard of
 chios, hymn delian apollo, thucydides, well as
 general tenor grecian legend, identifies homer himself. the
 author hymn, may, never described a
 blind man attaining utmost perfection art, been
 conscious memory bard maintained constant
 reference manuscript chest.”
 
loss digamma, _crux_ critics, quicksand upon
 even acumen bentley shipwrecked, seems prove beyond
 doubt, pronunciation greek language undergone a
 considerable change. now certainly difficult suppose the
 homeric poems suffered change, written copies
 preserved. chaucer’s poetry, instance, been
 written, come us softened form, more
 like effeminate version dryden, rough, quaint, noble
 original.
 
“at period,” continues grote, “these poems, indeed other
 greek poems, first began written, must matter conjecture,
 though ground assurance time of
 solôn. if, absence evidence, may venture upon naming any
 determinate period, question suggests itself, what
 purposes which, state society, manuscript its
 first commencement must intended answer? a
 written iliad necessary? rhapsodes; was
 planted memory, also interwoven feelings,
 conceived conjunction flexions intonations of

 readers capable analyzing complicated emotions had
 experienced hearers crowd, would, perusing the
 written words, realize imaginations sensible portion the
 impression communicated reciter. incredible statement may
 seem age like present, early societies, and
 early greece, time reading class existed.
 discover time class first began be
 formed, able make guess time old epic
 poems first committed writing. now period may with
 greatest probability fixed upon first witnessed the
 formation even narrowest reading class greece, middle
 seventh century christian æra (b.c. 660 b.c.
 630), age terpander, kallinus, archilochus, simonidês of
 amorgus, &c. ground supposition change operated in
 character tendencies grecian poetry music—the elegiac

 change important time poetry known mode of

 poetical effect; men stood forward it, may well be
 considered desirous study, competent criticize, their
 individual point view, written words homeric
 rhapsodies, just told kallinus noticed and
 eulogized thebaïs production homer. seems,
 therefore, ground conjecturing (for use this
 newly-formed important, narrow class), manuscripts the
 homeric poems old epics,—the thebaïs cypria, well
 iliad odyssey,—began compiled towards middle
 seventh century (b.c. 1); opening egypt grecian
 commerce, took place period, furnish

 reading class, formed, doubtless slowly increase, and
 number manuscripts along it; time of
 solôn, fifty years afterwards, readers manuscripts, though
 still comparatively few, might attained certain recognized
 authority, formed tribunal reference carelessness

even peisistratus suffered remain possession of
 credit, help feeling force following
 observations—
 
“there several incidental circumstances which, opinion,
 throw suspicion whole history peisistratid
 compilation, least theory, iliad cast its
 present stately harmonious form directions athenian
 ruler. great poets, flourished bright period of
 grecian song, which, alas! inherited little the
 fame, faint echo, stesichorus, anacreon, simonidês were
 employed noble task compiling iliad odyssey, much

 almost incredible, stronger marks athenian manufacture should
 remain. whatever occasional anomalies may detected, anomalies
 doubt arise ignorance language the
 homeric age, however irregular use digamma may have
 perplexed bentleys, name helen said have
 caused much disquiet distress fair one among the
 heroes age, however mr. knight may failed reducing the
 homeric language primitive form; however, finally, attic

 characteristics—still difficult suppose language,
 particularly joinings transitions, connecting parts,
 clearly betray incongruity ancient
 modern forms expression. quite character such
 period imitate antique style, order piece an
 imperfect poem character original, sir walter scott
 done continuation sir tristram.
 
“if, however, even faint indistinct traces athenian
 compilation discoverable language poems, total
 absence athenian national feeling perhaps less worthy of
 observation. later, may fairly suspected earlier times,
 athenians ordinarily jealous fame their
 ancestors. but, amid traditions glories early greece
 embodied iliad, athenians play subordinate and
 insignificant part. even passages relate their

return wolfian theory. confessed, that
 wolf’s objections primitive integrity iliad odyssey
 never wholly got over, help discovering they
 failed enlighten us substantial point, the
 difficulties whole subject beset, rather
 augmented otherwise, admit hypothesis. is
 lachmann’s[28] modification theory better. divides the
 first twenty-two books iliad sixteen different songs, and
 treats ridiculous belief amalgamation one
 regular poem belongs period earlier age peisistratus.
 this, grote observes, “explains gaps contradictions the
 narrative, explains nothing else.” moreover, find no
 contradictions warranting belief, so-called sixteen poets
 concur getting rid following leading men first battle
 secession achilles: elphenor, chief eubœans;
 tlepolemus, rhodians; pandarus, lycians; odius, the

 “it seems strange number independent poets have
 harmoniously dispensed services six sequel.”
 discrepancy, pylæmenes, represented dead the
 fifth book, weeps son’s funeral thirteenth, can be
 regarded result interpolation.
 
grote, although distinct stating opinions the
 subject, done much clearly show incongruity wolfian
 theory, lachmann’s modifications character of
 peisistratus. also shown, think equal success,
 two questions relative primitive unity poems,
 or, supposing impossible, unison parts by
 peisistratus, time, essentially distinct. in
 short, “a man may believe iliad put together of
 pre-existing songs, without recognising age peisistratus the
 period first compilation.” friends literary _employês_ of
 peisistratus must found iliad already ancient, the
 silence alexandrine critics respecting peisistratic
 “recension,” goes far prove, that, among numerous manuscripts
 examined, either wanting, thought unworthy of
 attention.
 
“moreover,” continues, “the whole tenor poems themselves
 confirms remarked. nothing, either iliad

 peisistratus—nothing brings view alterations

 literary friends peisistratus, hardly failed to
 notice, even without design, then, first time,
 undertaken task piecing together many self existent epics into
 one large aggregate. everything two great homeric poems, in
 substance language, belongs age two three centuries
 earlier peisistratus. indeed, even interpolations (or those
 passages which, best grounds, pronounced such) betray
 trace sixth century christ, may well been
 heard archilochus kallinus—in cases even arktinus and
 hesiod—as genuine homeric matter.[29] far evidences the
 case, well internal external, enable us judge, seem
 warranted believing iliad odyssey recited

 divergences text interpolations) 776 b.c., first

 added, best-authenticated fact, also most
 important attribute homeric poems, considered reference to
 grecian history; thus afford us insight the
 anti-historical character greeks, enabling us trace the
 subsequent forward march nation, seize instructive
 contrasts former later condition.”[30]
 
whole, inclined believe, labours of
 peisistratus wholly editorial character, although, must
 confess, can lay nothing respecting extent his
 labours. time, far believing composition
 primary arrangement poems, present form, the
 work peisistratus, rather persuaded fine taste and
 elegant mind athenian[31] lead preserve ancient
 traditional order poems, rather patch and
 re-construct according fanciful hypothesis. will repeat
 many discussions respecting whether poems written not,
 whether art writing known time reputed
 author. suffice say, read, less satisfied we
 upon either subject.
 
cannot, however, help thinking, story attributes the
 preservation poems lycurgus, little else version
 story peisistratus, historical
 probability must measured many others relating the
 spartan confucius.
 
will conclude sketch homeric theories, attempt,
 made ingenious friend, unite something like
 consistency. follows:—
 
“no doubt common soldiers age had, like common sailors
 fifty years ago, one qualified ‘discourse excellent
 music’ among them. many these, like negroes the
 united states, extemporaneous, allusive events passing

 which, retentive memory deemed virtue first water, and

 arguing unity authorship, ‘a great poet might re-cast

pope’s preface iliad homer
 

homer universally allowed greatest invention any
 writer whatever. praise judgment virgil justly contested
 him, others may pretensions particular
 excellences; invention remains yet unrivalled. a
 wonder ever acknowledged greatest poets, most
 excelled foundation poetry. the
 invention that, different degrees, distinguishes great geniuses:
 utmost stretch human study, learning, industry, which
 masters everything besides, can never attain this. furnishes art
 materials, without judgment can best but
 “steal wisely:” art like prudent steward lives on
 managing riches nature. whatever praises may given works
 judgment, even single beauty the
 invention must contribute: regular gardens, art can
 reduce beauties nature regularity, figure,
 common eye may better take in, is, therefore, more
 entertained with. and, perhaps, reason common critics are
 inclined prefer judicious methodical genius great and
 fruitful one, is, find easier pursue
 observations uniform bounded walk art, to
 comprehend vast various extent nature.
 
author’s work wild paradise, where, see the
 beauties distinctly ordered garden, the
 number infinitely greater. like copious nursery,
 contains seeds first productions every kind, of
 followed selected particular plants,
 according fancy, cultivate beautify. things
 luxuriant owing richness soil; if
 others arrived perfection maturity, because
 overrun oppressed stronger nature.
 
strength amazing invention attribute
 unequalled fire rapture forcible homer, no
 man true poetical spirit master reads him.
 writes animated nature imaginable; every thing
 moves, every thing lives, put action. council called,
 battle fought, coldly informed said or
 done third person; reader hurried by
 force poet’s imagination, turns one place a
 hearer, another spectator. course verses resembles
 army describes,
 
Οἵδ’ ἄῤ ἴσαν, ὡσεί τε πυρὶ χθὼν πἆσα νέμοιτο.
 
“they pour along like fire sweeps whole earth it.” it
 is, however, remarkable, fancy, everywhere vigorous,
 discovered immediately beginning poem its
 fullest splendour: grows progress upon and
 others, becomes fire, like chariot-wheel, rapidity.
 exact disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers,
 may found thousand; poetic fire, “vivida
 vis animi,” few. even works imperfect
 neglected, can overpower criticism, make us admire even
 disapprove. nay, appears, though attended with
 absurdities, brightens rubbish it, till see nothing
 splendour. fire discerned virgil, discerned
 glass, reflected homer, shining fierce, but
 everywhere equal constant: lucan statius bursts in
 sudden, short, interrupted flashes: milton glows like a
 furnace kept uncommon ardour force art: in
 shakspeare strikes aware, like accidental fire from
 heaven: homer, only, burns everywhere clearly and
 everywhere irresistibly.
 
shall endeavour show vast invention exerts in
 manner superior poet main constituent
 parts work: great peculiar characteristic which
 distinguishes authors.
 
strong ruling faculty like powerful star, which, the
 violence course, drew things within vortex. seemed
 enough taken whole circle arts, whole
 compass nature, supply maxims reflections; inward
 passions affections mankind, furnish characters: all
 outward forms images things descriptions: but
 wanting yet ampler sphere expatiate in, opened new and
 boundless walk imagination, created world in
 invention fable. aristotle calls “the soul of
 poetry,” first breathed homer. shall begin with
 considering part, naturally first; speak
 means design poem, taken for
 fiction.
 

fable may divided probable, allegorical, the
 marvellous. probable fable recital actions as,
 though happen, yet might, common course nature;
 as, though did, became fables additional
 episodes manner telling them. sort main story of
 epic poem, “the return ulysses, settlement trojans in
 italy,” like. iliad “anger achilles,” the
 short single subject ever chosen poet. yet
 supplied vaster variety incidents events, and
 crowded greater number councils, speeches, battles, and
 episodes kinds, found even poems whose
 schemes utmost latitude irregularity. action is
 hurried vehement spirit, whole duration
 employs much fifty days. virgil, want warm a
 genius, aided taking extensive subject, well as
 greater length time, contracting design homer’s
 poems one, yet fourth part large his. the
 epic poets used practice, generally carried it
 far superinduce multiplicity fables, destroy unity of
 action, lose readers unreasonable length time. nor
 main design unable add his
 invention, followed every episode part of
 story. given regular catalogue army, draw up
 forces order. funeral games patroclus,
 virgil anchises, statius (rather omit them)
 destroys unity actions archemorus. ulysses
 visit shades, Æneas virgil scipio silius sent
 him. detained return allurements of
 calypso, Æneas dido, rinaldo armida. achilles be
 absent army score quarrel half poem,
 rinaldo must absent just long like account. he
 gives hero suit celestial armour, virgil tasso make the
 present theirs. virgil observed close
 imitation homer, but, led way, supplied the
 want greek authors. thus story sinon, taking
 troy, copied (says macrobius) almost word word from
 pisander, loves dido Æneas taken medea
 jason apollonius, several others manner.
 

proceed allegorical fable—if reflect upon those
 innumerable knowledges, secrets nature physical philosophy
 homer generally supposed wrapped allegories,
 new ample scene wonder may consideration afford us!
 fertile will imagination appear, able clothe all
 properties elements, qualifications mind, virtues
 vices, forms persons, introduce actions
 agreeable nature things shadowed! field in
 succeeding poets dispute homer, whatever
 commendations allowed head, means for
 invention enlarged circle, judgment
 contracted it. mode learning changed the
 following ages, science delivered plainer manner, then
 became reasonable modern poets lay aside, it
 homer make use it. perhaps unhappy
 circumstance virgil, time demand
 upon great invention might capable furnishing all
 allegorical parts poem.
 

marvellous fable includes whatever supernatural, especially
 machines gods. homer first introduced the
 deities (as herodotus imagines) religion greece, seems
 first brought system machinery poetry, and
 one makes greatest importance dignity: find
 authors offended literal notion gods,
 constantly laying accusation homer chief support
 it. whatever cause might blame machines a
 philosophical religious view, perfect poetic,
 mankind ever since contented follow them: none have
 able enlarge sphere poetry beyond limits set:
 every attempt nature proved unsuccessful; the
 various changes times religions, gods continue day
 gods poetry.
 

come now characters persons; shall find no
 author ever drawn many, visible surprising a
 variety, given us lively affecting impressions them.
 every one something singularly own, painter could
 distinguished features, poet by
 manners. nothing can exact distinctions has
 observed different degrees virtues vices. single
 quality courage wonderfully diversified several characters
 iliad. achilles furious intractable; of
 diomede forward, yet listening advice, subject command; that
 ajax heavy self-confiding; hector, active vigilant:
 courage agamemnon inspirited love empire ambition;
 menelaus mixed softness tenderness people: we
 find idomeneus plain direct soldier; sarpedon gallant and
 generous one. judicious astonishing diversity be
 found principal quality constitutes main each
 character, even parts it, takes care to
 give tincture principal one. example: main characters
 ulysses nestor consist wisdom; distinct this,
 wisdom one artificial various, natural,
 open, regular. have, besides, characters courage; and
 quality also takes different turn difference of
 prudence; one war depends still upon caution, other
 upon experience. endless produce instances these
 kinds. characters virgil far striking us open
 manner; lie, great degree, hidden undistinguished; and,
 marked evidently affect us proportion to
 homer. characters valour much alike; even of
 turnus seems way peculiar, but, is, superior degree; and
 see nothing differences courage mnestheus of
 sergestus, cloanthus, rest. like manner may remarked of
 statius’s heroes, air impetuosity runs all; the
 horrid savage courage appears capaneus, tydeus,
 hippomedon, &c. parity character, makes seem
 brothers one family. believe reader led this
 tract reflection, will pursue epic tragic
 writers, will convinced infinitely superior, point,
 invention homer others.
 

speeches considered flow characters;
 perfect defective agree disagree manners,
 utter them. variety characters the
 iliad, speeches, poem. “everything in
 manner” (as aristotle expresses it), is, everything is
 acted spoken. hardly credible, work length, how
 small number lines employed narration. virgil the
 dramatic part less proportion narrative, speeches
 often consist general reflections thoughts, might be
 equally just person’s mouth upon occasion. many of
 persons apparent characters, many speeches escape
 applied judged rule propriety. oftener think of
 author read virgil, engaged in
 homer, effects colder invention, interests
 us less action described. homer makes us hearers, virgil
 leaves us readers.
 

if, next place, take view sentiments, same
 presiding faculty eminent sublimity spirit his
 thoughts. longinus given opinion, part
 homer principally excelled. alone sufficient prove the
 grandeur excellence sentiments general, is, they
 remarkable parity scripture. duport, his
 gnomologia homerica, collected innumerable instances sort.
 justice excellent modern writer allows, if
 virgil many thoughts low vulgar, so
 many sublime noble; roman author seldom rises
 astonishing sentiments fired iliad.
 

observe descriptions, images, similes, shall find the
 invention still predominant. else can ascribe vast
 comprehension images every sort, see circumstance
 art, individual nature, summoned together extent and
 fecundity imagination things, various
 views presented instant, impressions
 taken perfection heat? nay, gives us full
 prospects things, several unexpected peculiarities side
 views, unobserved painter homer. nothing surprising as
 descriptions battles, take less half the
 iliad, supplied vast variety incidents, no
 one bears likeness another; different kinds deaths, that
 two heroes wounded manner, profusion of
 noble ideas, every battle rises last greatness,
 horror, confusion. certain near number of
 images descriptions epic poet, though every one assisted
 great quantity him; evident virgil
 especially, scarce comparisons drawn from
 master.
 

descend hence expression, see bright
 imagination homer shining enlivened forms it. we
 acknowledge father poetical diction; first taught
 “language gods” men. expression like the
 colouring great masters, discovers laid on
 boldly, executed rapidity. is, indeed, strongest and
 glowing imaginable, touched greatest spirit.
 aristotle reason say, poet found out
 “living words;” daring figures metaphors than
 good author whatever. arrow “impatient” wing,
 weapon “thirsts” drink blood enemy, like, yet
 expression never big sense, justly great in
 proportion it. sentiment swells fills the
 diction, rises it, forms it, the
 degree thought warmer, expression will brighter,
 strong, will become perspicuous; like glass
 furnace, grows greater magnitude, refines a
 greater clearness, breath within powerful, the
 heat intense.
 

throw language prose, homer seems affected
 compound epithets. sort composition peculiarly proper
 poetry, heightened diction, assisted
 filled numbers greater sound pomp, likewise
 conduced measure thicken images. last
 consideration attribute also fruitfulness of
 invention, since (as managed them) sort of
 supernumerary pictures persons things were
 joined. see motion hector’s plumes epithet
 Κορυθαίολος, landscape mount neritus Εἰνοσίφυλλος,
 others, particular images insisted
 upon long express description (though a
 single line) without diverting reader much principal
 action figure. metaphor short simile, one these
 epithets short description.
 

lastly, consider versification, shall sensible a
 share praise due invention also. not
 satisfied language found settled one part of
 greece, searched different dialects this
 particular view, beautify perfect numbers considered
 greater mixture vowels consonants, and
 accordingly employed verse required either greater
 smoothness strength. affected ionic, has
 peculiar sweetness, never using contractions, its
 custom resolving diphthongs two syllables, make
 words open spreading sonorous fluency.
 mingled attic contractions, broader doric, the
 feebler Æolic, often rejects aspirate, takes its
 accent, completed variety altering letters the
 licence poetry. thus measures, instead fetters his
 sense, always readiness run along warmth his
 rapture, even give representation notions, in
 correspondence sounds signified. all
 derived harmony makes us confess not
 richest head, finest ear world. so
 great truth, whoever will consult tune verses,
 even without understanding (with sort diligence we
 daily see practised case italian operas), will find more
 sweetness, variety, majesty sound, language of
 poetry. beauty numbers allowed critics be
 copied faintly virgil himself, though just to
 ascribe nature latin tongue: indeed greek some
 advantages natural sound words, turn and
 cadence verse, agree genius language.
 virgil sensible this, used utmost diligence in
 working intractable language whatsoever graces was
 capable of, and, particular, never failed bring sound his
 line beautiful agreement sense. grecian poet has
 frequently celebrated account roman, the
 reason is, fewer critics understood one language than
 other. dionysius halicarnassus pointed many our
 author’s beauties kind, treatise composition of
 words. suffices present observe numbers, flow
 much ease, make one imagine homer care than
 transcribe fast muses dictated, and, time,
 much force inspiriting vigour, awaken raise
 us like sound trumpet. roll along plentiful river,
 always motion, always full; borne away tide of
 verse, rapid, yet smooth imaginable.
 

thus whatever side contemplate homer, principally strikes us
 invention. forms character part of
 work; accordingly find made fable more
 extensive copious other, manners lively and
 strongly marked, speeches affecting transported, his
 sentiments warm sublime, images descriptions full
 animated, expression raised daring, numbers
 rapid various. hope, said virgil, with
 regard heads, way derogated his
 character. nothing absurd endless, common method of
 comparing eminent writers opposition particular passages in
 them, forming judgment thence merit upon whole.
 certain knowledge principal character and
 distinguishing excellence each: consider
 him, proportion degree admire him. no
 author man ever excelled world one faculty; and
 homer done invention, virgil judgment. that
 think homer wanted judgment, virgil a
 eminent degree; virgil wanted invention, homer
 possessed larger share it; great authors of
 perhaps man besides, said less in
 comparison one another. homer greater genius, virgil the
 better artist. one admire man, work.
 homer hurries transports us commanding impetuosity; virgil
 leads us attractive majesty; homer scatters generous
 profusion; virgil bestows careful magnificence; homer, like the
 nile, pours riches boundless overflow; virgil, like a
 river banks, gentle constant stream. behold
 battles, methinks two poets resemble heroes they
 celebrate. homer, boundless resistless achilles, bears all
 him, shines tumult increases; virgil,
 calmly daring, like Æneas, appears undisturbed midst the
 action; disposes him, conquers tranquillity. and
 look upon machines, homer seems like jupiter in
 terrors, shaking olympus, scattering lightnings, firing the
 heavens: virgil, like power benevolence, counselling
 gods, laying plans empires, regularly ordering his
 whole creation.
 

all, great parts, great virtues, they
 naturally border imperfection; often hard to
 distinguish exactly virtue ends, fault begins. as
 prudence may sometimes sink suspicion, may great judgment
 decline coldness; magnanimity may run profusion or
 extravagance, may great invention redundancy wildness. we
 look upon homer view, shall perceive chief objections
 proceed noble cause excess this
 faculty.
 

among may reckon marvellous fictions, upon which
 much criticism spent, surpassing bounds of
 probability. perhaps may great superior souls, with
 gigantic bodies, which, exerting unusual strength,
 exceed commonly thought due proportion parts, become
 miracles whole; and, like old heroes make, commit
 something near extravagance, amidst series glorious inimitable
 performances. thus homer “speaking horses;” virgil his
 “myrtles distilling blood;” latter much as
 contrived easy intervention deity save probability.
 

owing vast invention, similes been
 thought exuberant full circumstances. force this
 faculty seen nothing more, inability confine
 single circumstance upon comparison is
 grounded: runs embellishments additional images, which,
 however, managed overpower main one. similes
 like pictures, principal figure its
 proportion given agreeable original, also set with
 occasional ornaments prospects. will account his
 manner heaping number comparisons together one breath, when
 fancy suggested many various correspondent
 images. reader will easily extend observation more
 objections kind.
 

others seem rather charge defect or
 narrowness genius, excess it, seeming defects will
 found upon examination proceed wholly nature the
 times lived in. grosser representations gods;
 vicious imperfect manners heroes; must here
 speak word latter, point generally carried into
 extremes, censurers defenders homer. must a
 strange partiality antiquity, think madame dacier,[38] “that
 times manners much excellent, are
 contrary ours.” can prejudiced favour to
 magnify felicity ages, spirit revenge and
 cruelty, joined practice rapine robbery, reigned
 world: mercy shown sake lucre;
 greatest princes put sword, wives and
 daughters made slaves concubines? side, be
 delicate modern critics, shocked servile
 offices mean employments sometimes see heroes of
 homer engaged. pleasure taking view simplicity,
 opposition luxury succeeding ages: beholding monarchs
 without guards; princes tending flocks, princesses
 drawing water springs. read homer, reflect
 reading ancient author heathen world; and
 consider light, will double pleasure the
 perusal him. let think growing acquainted nations
 people now more; stepping almost three
 thousand years back remotest antiquity, entertaining
 clear surprising vision things nowhere else to
 found, true mirror ancient world. means
 alone greatest obstacles will vanish; usually creates
 dislike, will become satisfaction.
 
consideration may serve answer constant use of
 epithets gods heroes; “far-darting
 phœbus,” “blue-eyed pallas,” “swift-footed achilles,” &c.,
 censured impertinent, tediously repeated. those
 gods depended upon powers offices believed to
 belong them; contracted weight veneration the
 rites solemn devotions used: sort of
 attributes matter religion salute all
 occasions, irreverence omit. epithets
 great men, mons. boileau opinion, nature
 surnames, repeated such; greeks names
 derived fathers, obliged add distinction
 person; either naming parents expressly, place of
 birth, profession, like: alexander philip,
 herodotus halicarnassus, diogenes cynic, &c. homer, therefore,
 complying custom country, used distinctive
 additions better agreed poetry. and, indeed, something
 parallel modern times, names harold
 harefoot, edmund ironside, edward longshanks, edward black prince,
 &c. yet thought account better propriety for
 repetition, shall add conjecture. hesiod, dividing the
 world different ages, placed fourth age, the
 brazen iron one, “heroes distinct men; divine
 race fought thebes troy, called demi-gods, live by
 care jupiter islands blessed.”[39] now among the
 divine honours paid them, might also in
 common gods, mentioned without solemnity an
 epithet, might acceptable celebrating their
 families, actions qualities.
 
cavils raised homer, hardly
 deserve reply, will yet taken notice occur the
 course work. many occasioned injudicious
 endeavour exalt virgil; much same, one should
 think raise superstructure undermining foundation: one
 imagine, whole course parallels, these
 critics never much heard homer’s written first; a
 consideration whoever compares two poets have
 always eye. accuse things they
 overlook praise other; prefer fable and
 moral Æneis iliad, reasons which
 might set odyssey Æneis; hero wiser man,
 action one beneficial country of
 other; else blame never designed;
 achilles good perfect prince Æneas, when
 moral poem required contrary character: thus
 rapin judges comparison homer virgil. others select
 particular passages homer laboured some
 virgil drew them: whole management scaliger
 poetics. others quarrel take low mean
 expressions, sometimes false delicacy refinement, oftener
 ignorance graces original, triumph in
 awkwardness translations: conduct of
 perrault parallels. lastly, others, who, pretending to
 fairer proceeding, distinguish personal merit homer,
 work; come assign causes the
 great reputation iliad, found upon ignorance his
 times, prejudice followed; pursuance of

 rash paraphrase can make amends general defect; no
 less danger lose spirit ancient, deviating the
 modern manners expression. sometimes darkness, there
 often light antiquity, nothing better preserves a

 homer will teach us, will follow modestly in
 footsteps. diction bold lofty, let us raise ours
 high can; plain humble, to
 deterred imitating fear incurring censure of
 mere english critic. nothing belongs homer seems been
 commonly mistaken just pitch style: his
 translators swelled fustian proud confidence the
 sublime; others sunk flatness, cold timorous notion of
 simplicity. methinks see different followers homer, some
 sweating straining violent leaps bounds (the
 certain signs false mettle), others slowly servilely creeping in
 train, poet time proceeding an
 unaffected equal majesty them. however, two extremes
 one sooner pardon frenzy frigidity; author be

 style, friends must agree together call simplicity, and
 rest world will call dulness. graceful and
 dignified simplicity, well bold sordid one; differ as
 much air plain man sloven:
 one thing tricked up, another dressed all.
 simplicity mean ostentation rusticity.
 
pure noble simplicity nowhere perfection the
 scripture author. one may affirm, respect the
 inspired writings, divine spirit made use words
 intelligible common men time, that
 part world; and, homer author nearest those, his
 style must course bear greater resemblance sacred books
 writer. consideration (together what
 observed parity thoughts) may, methinks,
 induce translator, one hand, give several those
 general phrases manners expression, attained a
 veneration even language used old testament;
 as, other, avoid appropriated the

 like, (into translators fallen) be
 allowable; excepted without impossible treat

two peculiarities homer’s diction, sort of
 marks moles every common eye distinguishes first
 sight; greatest admirers look upon as
 defects, are, seemed pleased beauties. i
 speak compound epithets, repetitions. many the
 former done literally english without destroying the
 purity language. believe retained slide

 periphrasis: “the lofty mountain shakes waving woods.” others that
 admit different significations, may receive advantage a
 judicious variation, according occasions are
 introduced. example, epithet apollo, ἑκηβόλος or
 “far-shooting,” capable two explications; one literal, respect
 darts bow, ensigns god; allegorical,
 regard rays sun; therefore, places where
 apollo represented god person, use former
 interpretation; effects sun described, would
 make choice latter. upon whole, will necessary to
 avoid perpetual repetition epithets find in
 homer, which, though might accommodated (as already
 shown) ear times, means ours: one
 may wait opportunities placing them, derive an
 additional beauty occasions employed; in
 properly, translator may show fancy his
 judgment.
 
homer’s repetitions, may divide three sorts: of
 whole narrations speeches, single sentences, one verse or
 hemistitch. hope impossible regard these,
 neither lose known mark author one hand, nor
 offend reader much other. repetition not
 ungraceful speeches, dignity speaker renders

 best rule is, guided nearness, distance, the
 repetitions placed original: follow close, one
 may vary expression; question, whether professed
 translator authorized omit any: tedious, author is

remains speak versification. homer (as said)

 thus spoke prudence fears age:
 
“beloved jove, achilles! would’st thou know

 sure protection, thy power sword:
 must speak wisdom conceal,
 truths, invidious great, reveal,
 bold task, subjects, grown wise,
 instruct monarch error lies;
 though deem short-lived fury past,
 ’tis sure mighty will revenge last.”
 pelides:—“from thy inmost soul
 speak thou know’st, speak without control.
 e’en god swear rules day,
 thy hands vows greece convey.
 whose bless’d oracles thy lips declare;
 long achilles breathes vital air,
 daring greek, numerous band,
 priest shall lift impious hand;
 e’en chief hosts led,

encouraged thus, blameless man replies:
 “nor vows unpaid, slighted sacrifice,

 will god’s awaken’d fury cease,
 plagues shall spread, funeral fires increase,
 till great king, without ransom paid,

prophet spoke: gloomy frown
 monarch started shining throne;

 “augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,

 (aëtion’s realm), conquering army came,
 treasure loaded triumphant spoils,
 whose just division crown’d soldier’s toils;
 bright chryseïs, heavenly prize! led,
 vote selected, general’s bed.
 priest phœbus sought gifts gain
 beauteous daughter victor’s chain;
 fleet reach’d, and, lowly bending down,
 held forth sceptre laurel crown,
 intreating all; chief implored grace
 brother-kings atreus’ royal race:
 generous greeks joint consent declare,
 priest reverence, release fair;
 atrides: he, wonted pride,
 sire insulted, gifts denied:
 insulted sire (his god’s peculiar care)
 phœbus pray’d, phœbus heard prayer:
 dreadful plague ensues: avenging darts
 incessant fly, pierce grecian hearts.
 prophet then, inspired heaven, arose,
 points crime, thence derives woes:
 first assembled chiefs incline
 avert vengeance power divine;
 rising wrath, monarch storm’d;
 incensed threaten’d, threats perform’d:
 fair chryseïs sire sent,
 offer’d gifts make god relent;
 now seized briseïs’ heavenly charms,
 valour’s prize defrauds arms,
 defrauds votes grecian train;[63]
 service, faith, justice, plead vain.
 but, goddess! thou thy suppliant attend.
 high olympus’ shining court ascend,
 urge ties former service owed,
 sue vengeance thundering god.
 oft hast thou triumph’d glorious boast,
 thou stood’st forth ethereal host,
 bold rebellion shook realms above,
 undaunted guard cloud-compelling jove:
 bright partner awful reign,
 warlike maid, monarch main,
 traitor-gods, mad ambition driven,
 durst threat chains omnipotence heaven.
 then, call’d thee, monster titan came
 (whom gods briareus, men Ægeon name),
 wondering skies enormous stalk’d along;
 shakes solid earth strong:
 giant-pride jove’s high throne stands,
 brandish’d round hundred hands:
 affrighted gods confess’d awful lord,
 dropp’d fetters, trembled, adored.[64]
 this, goddess, remembrance call,
 embrace knees, tribunal fall;
 conjure far drive grecian train,
 hurl headlong fleet main,
 heap shores copious death, bring
 greeks know curse king.
 let agamemnon lift haughty head
 o’er wide dominion dead,
 mourn blood e’er durst disgrace
 boldest warrior grecian race.”

“unhappy son! (fair thetis thus replies,
 tears celestial trickle eyes)
 borne thee mother’s throes,
 fates averse, nursed future woes?[65]
 short space light heaven view!
 short space! fill’d sorrow too!
 might parent’s careful wish prevail,
 far, far ilion thy vessels sail,
 thou, camps remote, danger shun
 now, alas! nearly threats son.
 yet (what can) move thy suit i’ll go
 great olympus crown’d fleecy snow.
 meantime, secure within thy ships, far
 behold field, mingle war.
 sire gods ethereal train,
 warm limits farthest main,
 now mix mortals, disdain grace
 feasts Æthiopia’s blameless race,[66]
 twelve days powers indulge genial rite,
 returning twelfth revolving light.
 will mount brazen dome, move
 high tribunal immortal jove.”
 
goddess spoke: rolling waves unclose;
 steep plunged whence rose,
 left sorrowing lonely coast,
 wild resentment fair lost.
 
chrysa’s port now sage ulysses rode;
 beneath deck destined victims stow’d:
 sails furl’d, lash mast aside,
 dropp’d anchors, pinnace tied.
 next shore hecatomb land;
 chryseïs last descending strand.
 her, thus returning furrow’d main,
 ulysses led phœbus’ sacred fane;
 solemn altar, maid
 gave chryses, thus hero said:
 
“hail, reverend priest! phœbus’ awful dome
 suppliant great atrides come:
 unransom’d, receive spotless fair;
 accept hecatomb greeks prepare;
 may thy god scatters darts around,
 atoned sacrifice, desist wound.”[67]
 
this, sire embraced maid again,
 sadly lost, lately sought vain.
 near altar darting king,
 disposed rank hecatomb bring;
 water purify hands, take
 sacred offering salted cake;
 thus arms devoutly raised air,
 solemn voice, priest directs prayer:
 
“god silver bow, thy ear incline,
 whose power incircles cilla divine;
 whose sacred eye thy tenedos surveys,
 gilds fair chrysa distinguish’d rays!
 if, fired vengeance thy priest’s request,
 thy direful darts inflict raging pest:
 attend! avert wasteful woe,
 smile propitious, unbend thy bow.”
 
chryses pray’d. apollo heard prayer:
 now greeks hecatomb prepare;
 horns salted barley threw,
 and, heads heaven, victims slew:[68]
 limbs sever inclosing hide;
 thighs, selected gods, divide:
 these, double cauls involved art,
 choicest morsels lay every part.
 priest altar stands,
 burns offering holy hands.
 pours black wine, sees flames aspire;
 youth instruments surround fire:
 thighs thus sacrificed, entrails dress’d,
 assistants part, transfix, roast rest:
 spread tables, repast prepare;
 takes seat, receives share.
 now rage hunger repress’d,
 pure libations conclude feast;
 youths wine copious goblets crown’d,[69]
 and, pleased, dispense flowing bowls around
 hymns divine joyous banquet ends,
 pæans lengthen’d till sun descends:
 greeks, restored, grateful notes prolong;
 apollo listens, approves song.
 
’twas night; chiefs beside vessel lie,
 till rosy morn purpled o’er sky:
 launch, hoist mast: indulgent gales,
 supplied phœbus, fill swelling sails;
 milk-white canvas bellying blow,
 parted ocean foams roars below:
 bounding billows swift flew,
 till now grecian camp appear’d view.
 far beach haul bark land,
 (the crooked keel divides yellow sand,)
 part, stretch’d along winding bay,
 ships tents mingled prospect lay.
 
raging still, amidst navy sat
 stern achilles, stedfast hate;
 mix’d combat, council join’d;
 wasting cares lay heavy mind:
 black thoughts revenge slaughter roll,
 scenes blood rise dreadful soul.
 
twelve days past, now dawning light
 gods summon’d olympian height:
 jove, first ascending watery bowers,
 leads long order ethereal powers.
 when, like morning-mist early day,
 rose flood daughter sea:
 seats divine flight address’d.
 there, far apart, high rest,
 thunderer sat; old olympus shrouds
 hundred heads heaven, props clouds.
 suppliant goddess stood: one hand placed
 beneath beard, one knees embraced.
 “if e’er, father gods! (she said)
 words please thee, actions aid,
 marks honour bestow,
 pay glory life owe.
 fame least heavenly promise due
 life short, now dishonour’d too.
 avenge wrong, ever just wise!
 let greece humbled, trojans rise;
 till proud king achaian race
 shall heap honours now disgrace.”
 

[illustration: ] thetis entreating jupiter honour achilles
 

thus thetis spoke; jove silence held
 sacred counsels breast conceal’d.
 repulsed, goddess closer press’d,
 still grasp’d knees, urged dear request.
 “o sire gods men! thy suppliant hear;
 refuse, grant; jove fear?
 oh! declare, powers above,
 wretched thetis least care jove?”
 
said; and, sighing, thus god replies,
 rolls thunder o’er vaulted skies:
 
“what hast thou ask’d? ah, jove engage
 foreign contests domestic rage,
 gods’ complaints, juno’s fierce alarms,
 i, partial, aid trojan arms?
 go, lest haughty partner sway
 jealous eyes thy close access survey;
 part peace, secure thy prayer sped:
 witness sacred honours head,
 nod ratifies will divine,
 faithful, fix’d, irrevocable sign;
 seals thy suit, fulfils thy vows—”
 spoke, awful bends sable brows,[70]
 shakes ambrosial curls, gives nod,
 stamp fate sanction god:
 high heaven trembling dread signal took,
 olympus centre shook.[71]
 
swift seas profound goddess flies,
 jove starry mansions skies.
 shining synod immortals wait
 coming god, thrones state
 arising silent, wrapp’d holy fear,
 majesty heaven appear.
 trembling stand, jove assumes throne,
 all, god’s imperious queen alone:
 late view’d silver-footed dame,
 passions kindled flame.
 “say, artful manager heaven (she cries),
 now partakes secrets skies?
 thy juno knows decrees fate,
 vain partner imperial state.
 favourite goddess cares divides,
 jove prudence consort hides?”
 
thunderer: “seek thou find
 sacred counsels almighty mind:
 involved darkness lies great decree,
 can depths fate pierced thee.
 fits thy knowledge, thou first shalt know;
 first gods above, men below;
 thou, they, shall search thoughts roll
 deep close recesses soul.”
 
full sire goddess skies
 roll’d large orbs majestic eyes,
 thus return’d:—“austere saturnius, say,
 whence wrath, controls thy sway?
 thy boundless will, me, remains force,
 thy counsels take destined course.
 ’tis greece fear: late seen,
 close consult, silver-footed queen.
 jove thetis nothing deny,
 signal vain shook sky.
 fatal favour goddess won,
 grace fierce, inexorable son?
 perhaps grecian blood drench plain,
 glut vengeance people slain.”
 
thus god: “o restless fate pride,
 strives learn heaven resolves hide;
 vain search, presumptuous abhorr’d,
 anxious thee, odious thy lord.
 let suffice: immutable decree
 force can shake: is, be.
 goddess, submit; dare will withstand,
 dread power avenging hand:
 united strength gods above
 vain resists omnipotence jove.”
 

[illustration: ] vulcan
 

thunderer spoke, durst queen reply;
 reverent horror silenced sky.
 feast disturb’d, sorrow vulcan saw
 mother menaced, gods awe;
 peace heart, pleasure design,
 thus interposed architect divine:
 “the wretched quarrels mortal state
 far unworthy, gods! debate:
 let men days senseless strife employ,
 we, eternal peace constant joy.
 thou, goddess-mother, sire comply,
 break sacred union sky:
 lest, roused rage, shake bless’d abodes,
 launch red lightning, dethrone gods.
 submit, thunderer stands appeased;
 gracious power willing pleased.”
 
thus vulcan spoke: rising bound,
 double bowl sparkling nectar crown’d,[72]
 held juno cheerful way,
 “goddess (he cried), patient obey.
 dear are, jove arm extend,
 can grieve, unable defend.
 god daring aid move,
 lift hand force jove?
 cause felt matchless might,
 hurl’d headlong ethereal height;[73]
 toss’d day rapid circles round,
 till sun descended touch’d ground.
 breathless fell, giddy motion lost;
 sinthians raised lemnian coast;[74]
 
said, hands goblet heaved,
 which, smile, white-arm’d queen received
 then, rest fill’d; turn,
 lips applied nectar’d urn,
 vulcan awkward grace office plies,
 unextinguish’d laughter shakes skies.
 
thus blest gods genial day prolong,
 feasts ambrosial, celestial song.[75]
 apollo tuned lyre; muses round
 voice alternate aid silver sound.
 meantime radiant sun mortal sight
 descending swift, roll’d rapid light:
 starry domes gods depart,
 shining monuments vulcan’s art:
 jove couch reclined awful head,
 juno slumber’d golden bed.

“canst thou, monarch’s cares oppress’d,

 awake, waking advice approve,

phantom said; vanish’d sight,
 resolves air, mixes night.
 thousand schemes monarch’s mind employ;
 elate thought sacks untaken troy:
 vain was, future blind,
 saw jove secret fate design’d,
 mighty toils either host remain,

 eager rises, fancy hears
 voice celestial murmuring ears.
 first limbs slender vest drew,
 around next regal mantle threw,
 embroider’d sandals feet tied;

now rosy morn ascends court jove,
 lifts light, opens day above.
 king despatch’d heralds commands

 gathering hosts monarch’s word obey;
 fleet atrides bends way.
 black ship pylian prince found;
 calls senate peers around:
 assembly placed, king men express’d

“friends confederates! attentive ear

 late slumber’d shades night,
 dream divine appear’d sight;
 whose visionary form like nestor came,

 heavenly phantom hover’d o’er head,
 ‘and, dost thou sleep, atreus’ son? (he said)

spoke, sat: nestor, rising said,
 (nestor, pylos’ sandy realms obey’d,)
 “princes greece, faithful ears incline,
 doubt vision powers divine;
 sent great jove rules host,
 forbid it, heaven! warning lost!
 let us haste, obey god’s alarms,
 join rouse sons greece arms.”
 
thus spoke sage: kings without delay
 dissolve council, chief obey:
 sceptred rulers lead; following host,
 pour’d forth thousands, darkens coast.
 rocky cleft shepherd sees
 clustering heaps heaps driving bees,
 rolling blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,
 deeper murmurs hoarse alarms;
 dusky spread, close embodied crowd,
 o’er vale descends living cloud.[81]
 so, tents ships, lengthen’d train
 spreads beach, wide o’ershades plain:
 along region runs deafening sound;
 beneath footsteps groans trembling ground.
 fame flies messenger jove,
 shining soars, claps wings above.
 nine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud[82]
 monarch’s will, suspend listening crowd.
 soon throngs order ranged appear,
 fainter murmurs died upon ear,
 king kings awful figure raised:
 high hand golden sceptre blazed;
 golden sceptre, celestial flame,
 vulcan form’d, jove hermes came.
 pelops immortal gift resign’d;
 immortal gift great pelops left behind,
 atreus’ hand, atreus ends,
 rich thyestes next prize descends;
 now mark agamemnon’s reign,
 subjects argos, controls main.[83]
 
bright sceptre now king reclined,
 artful thus pronounced speech design’d:
 “ye sons mars, partake leader’s care,
 heroes greece, brothers war!
 partial jove justice complain,
 heavenly oracles believed vain
 safe return promised toils,
 renown’d, triumphant, enrich’d spoils.
 now shameful flight alone can save host,
 blood, treasure, glory lost.
 jove decrees, resistless lord all!
 whose command whole empires rise fall:
 shakes feeble props human trust,
 towns armies humbles dust.
 shame greece fruitful war wage,
 oh, lasting shame every future age!
 great arms, common scorn grow,
 repulsed baffled feeble foe.
 small number, wars ceased,
 greece triumphant held general feast,
 rank’d tens, whole decades dine
 must want trojan slave pour wine.[84]
 forces hopes o’erthrown,
 troy prevails armies own.
 now nine long years mighty jove run,
 since first labours war begun:
 cordage torn, decay’d vessels lie,
 scarce insure wretched power fly.
 haste, then, ever leave trojan wall!
 weeping wives, tender children call:
 love, duty, safety, summon us away,
 ’tis nature’s voice, nature obey.
 shatter’d barks may yet transport us o’er,
 safe inglorious, native shore.
 fly, grecians, fly, sails oars employ,
 dream heaven-defended troy.”
 
deep design unknown, hosts approve
 atrides’ speech. mighty numbers move.
 roll billows icarian shore,
 east south winds begin roar,
 burst dark mansions clouds, sweep
 whitening surface ruffled deep.
 corn western gusts descend,[85]
 blast lofty harvests bend:
 thus o’er field moving host appears,
 nodding plumes groves waving spears.
 gathering murmur spreads, trampling feet
 beat loose sands, thicken fleet;
 long-resounding cries urge train
 fit ships, launch main.
 toil, sweat, thick clouds dust arise,
 doubling clamours echo skies.
 e’en greeks left hostile plain,
 fate decreed fall troy vain;
 jove’s imperial queen flight survey’d,
 sighing thus bespoke blue-eyed maid:
 
“shall grecians fly! dire disgrace!
 leave unpunish’d perfidious race?
 shall troy, shall priam, adulterous spouse,
 peace enjoy fruits broken vows?
 bravest chiefs, helen’s quarrel slain,
 lie unrevenged yon detested plain?
 no: let greeks, unmoved vain alarms,
 refulgent shine brazen arms.
 haste, goddess, haste! flying host detain,
 let one sail hoisted main.”
 
pallas obeys, olympus’ height
 swift ships precipitates flight.
 ulysses, first public cares, found,
 prudent counsel like gods renown’d:
 oppress’d generous grief hero stood,
 drew sable vessels flood.
 “and thus, divine laertes’ son,
 thus fly greeks (the martial maid begun),
 thus country bear disgrace,
 fame eternal leave priam’s race?
 shall beauteous helen still remain unfreed,
 still unrevenged, thousand heroes bleed!
 haste, generous ithacus! prevent shame,
 recall armies, chiefs reclaim.
 resistless eloquence employ,
 immortals trust fall troy.”
 
voice divine confess’d warlike maid,
 ulysses heard, uninspired obey’d:
 meeting first atrides, hand
 received imperial sceptre command.
 thus graced, attention respect gain,
 runs, flies grecian train;
 prince name, chief arms approved,
 fired praise, persuasion moved.
 
“warriors like you, strength wisdom bless’d,
 brave examples confirm rest.
 monarch’s will yet reveal’d appears;
 tries courage, resents fears.
 unwary greeks fury may provoke;
 thus king secret council spoke.
 jove loves chief, jove honour springs,
 beware! dreadful wrath kings.”
 
clamorous vile plebeian rose,
 reproof check’d tamed blows.
 “be still, thou slave, thy betters yield;
 unknown alike council field!
 ye gods, dastards host command!
 swept war, lumber land.
 silent, wretch, think allow’d
 worst tyrants, usurping crowd.
 one sole monarch jove commits sway;
 laws, let obey.”[86]
 
words like troops ulysses ruled,
 loudest silenced, fiercest cool’d.
 back assembly roll thronging train,
 desert ships, pour upon plain.
 murmuring move, old ocean roars,
 heaves huge surges trembling shores;
 groaning banks burst bellowing sound,
 rocks remurmur deeps rebound.
 length tumult sinks, noises cease,
 still silence lulls camp peace.
 thersites clamour’d throng,
 loquacious, loud, turbulent tongue:
 awed shame, respect controll’d,
 scandal busy, reproaches bold:
 witty malice studious defame,
 scorn joy, laughter aim:—
 chief gloried licentious style
 lash great, monarchs revile.
 figure might soul proclaim;
 one eye blinking, one leg lame:
 mountain shoulders half breast o’erspread,
 thin hairs bestrew’d long misshapen head.
 spleen mankind envious heart possess’d,
 much hated all, best:
 ulysses achilles still theme;
 royal scandal delight supreme,
 long lived scorn every greek,
 vex’d spoke, yet still heard speak.
 sharp voice; shrillest tone,
 thus injurious taunts attack’d throne.
 
“amidst glories bright reign,
 moves great atrides complain?
 ’tis thine whate’er warrior’s breast inflames,
 golden spoil, thine lovely dames.
 wealth wars blood bestow,
 thy tents crowded thy chests o’erflow.
 thus full ease heaps riches roll’d,
 grieves monarch? thirst gold?
 say, shall march unconquer’d powers
 (the greeks i) ilion’s hostile towers,
 bring race royal bastards here,
 troy ransom price dear?
 safer plunder thy host supplies;
 say, wouldst thou seize valiant leader’s prize?
 or, thy heart generous love led,
 captive fair, bless thy kingly bed?
 whate’er master craves submit must,
 plagued pride, punish’d lust.
 oh women achaia; men more!
 hence let us fly, let waste store
 loves pleasures phrygian shore.
 may wanted busy day,
 hector comes: great achilles may:

 him, fierce, fearless, brave:
 durst he, ought, resent wrong,

fierce seat ulysses springs,[87]
 generous vengeance king kings.
 indignation sparkling eyes,
 views wretch, sternly thus replies:
 
“peace, factious monster, born vex state,
 wrangling talents form’d foul debate:
 curb impetuous tongue, rashly vain,
 singly mad, asperse sovereign reign.
 known thee, slave! host,
 man acts least, upbraids most?
 think greeks shameful flight bring,
 let lips profane name king.
 return trust heavenly powers;

 grant host wealth general load,
 except detraction, hast thou bestow’d?
 suppose hero spoils resign,
 art thou hero, spoils thine?
 gods! let perish hateful shore,
 let eyes behold more;
 if, thy next offence, hand forbear
 strip arms thou ill deserv’st wear,
 expel council princes meet,
 send thee scourged howling fleet.”
 
said, cowering dastard bends,
 weighty sceptre back descends.[88]
 round bunch bloody tumours rise:
 tears spring starting haggard eyes;
 trembling sat, shrunk abject fears,
 vile visage wiped scalding tears;
 neighbour express’d thought:
 
“ye gods! wonders ulysses wrought!
 fruits conduct courage yield!
 great council, glorious field.
 generous rises crown’s defence,
 curb factious tongue insolence,
 just examples offenders shown,
 sedition silence, assert throne.”
 
’twas thus general voice hero praised,
 who, rising, high imperial sceptre raised:
 blue-eyed pallas, celestial friend,
 (in form herald,) bade crowds attend.
 expecting crowds still attention hung,
 hear wisdom heavenly tongue.
 deeply thoughtful, pausing ere spoke,
 silence thus prudent hero broke:
 
“unhappy monarch! grecian race
 shame deserting, heap vile disgrace.
 argos generous vow:
 voice, ah! forgotten now:

 till troy’s proud structures ashes lie.
 behold weeping native shore;

 beside fountain’s sacred brink raised
 verdant altars, victims blazed:
 ’twas plane-tree spread shades around,

 mighty dragon shot, dire portent;
 jove dreadful sign sent.
 straight tree sanguine spires roll’d,
 curl’d around many winding fold;
 topmost branch mother-bird possess’d;
 eight callow infants fill’d mossy nest;

 thus spoke prophet, thus fates succeed.

 said: shores loud applauses sound,
 hollow ships deafening shout rebound.
 nestor thus—“these vain debates forbear,
 ye talk like children, like heroes dare.
 now high resolves last?
 leagues concluded, engagements past?
 vow’d libations victims then,

 useless words consume unactive hours,

 chief, soldier, numerous band,
 bravely fights, ill obeys command,
 thus distinct war, shall soon known

king: “how much thy years excel
 arts counsel, speaking well!
 gods, love greece, decree
 ten sages grant thee;
 wisdom soon priam’s force destroy,
 soon fall haughty towers troy!
 jove forbids, plunges hates
 fierce contention vain debates:
 now great achilles aid withdraws,
 provoked; captive maid cause:
 e’er friends join, trojan wall
 must shake, heavy will vengeance fall!
 now, ye warriors, take short repast;
 and, well refresh’d, bloody conflict haste.
 sharpen’d spear let every grecian wield,
 every grecian fix brazen shield,
 let excite fiery steeds war,

 aching nerve refuse lance throw,
 spent courser chariot blow.

 dares tremble signal day;
 wretch, mean fall martial power,
 birds shall mangle, dogs devour.”
 
monarch spoke; straight murmur rose,
 loud surges tempest blows,
 dash’d broken rocks tumultuous roar,
 foam thunder stony shore.
 straight tents troops dispersing bend,
 fires kindled, smokes ascend;
 hasty feasts sacrifice, pray,
 avert dangers doubtful day.

 ajax less, ajax telamon;[95]

 chiefs surround destined beast, take

 thus king prefers solemn prayer;
 “o thou! whose thunder rends clouded air,

 hear! burning sun descends,
 night gloomy veil extends,
 low dust laid yon hostile spires,
 priam’s palace sunk grecian fires.

thus prayed chief: unavailing prayer

duel menelaus paris.
 

armies ready engage, single combat agreed upon
 menelaus paris (by intervention hector) the
 determination war. iris sent call helen behold the
 fight. leads walls troy, priam sat his
 counsellers observing grecian leaders plain below, whom
 helen gives account chief them. kings either part
 take solemn oath conditions combat. duel ensues;
 wherein paris overcome, snatched away cloud venus,
 transported apartment. calls helen walls,
 brings lovers together. agamemnon, part grecians,
 demands restoration helen, performance articles.
 three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout book.
 scene sometimes fields troy, sometimes in
 troy itself.
 

thus leaders’ care martial band
 moves ranks, stretches o’er land.
 shouts trojans, rushing afar,
 proclaim motions, provoke war.
 inclement winters vex plain
 piercing frosts, thick-descending rain,
 warmer seas cranes embodied fly,[108]
 noise, order, midway sky;
 pigmy nations wounds death bring,
 war descends upon wing,
 silent, breathing rage, resolved skill’d[109]
 mutual aids fix doubtful field,
 swift march greeks: rapid dust around
 darkening arises labour’d ground.
 thus flaggy wings notus sheds
 night vapours round mountain heads,
 swift-gliding mists dusky fields invade,
 thieves grateful midnight shade;
 scarce swains feeding flocks survey,
 lost confused amidst thicken’d day:
 wrapp’d gathering dust, grecian train,
 moving cloud, swept on, hid plain.
 
now front front hostile armies stand,
 eager fight, wait command;
 when, van, sons fame
 troy sent forth, beauteous paris came:
 form god! panther’s speckled hide
 flow’d o’er armour easy pride:
 bended bow across shoulders flung,
 sword beside negligently hung;
 two pointed spears shook gallant grace,
 dared bravest grecian race.
 
thus, glorious air proud disdain,
 boldly stalk’d, foremost plain,
 menelaus, loved mars, espies,
 heart elated, joyful eyes:
 joys lion, branching deer,
 mountain goat, bulky prize, appear;
 eager seizes devours slain,
 press’d bold youths baying dogs vain.
 thus fond vengeance, furious bound,
 clanging arms leaps upon ground
 high chariot: him, approaching near,
 beauteous champion views marks fear,
 smit conscious sense, retires behind,
 shuns fate well deserved find.
 shepherd, rustling trees[110]
 shot forth view, scaly serpent sees,
 trembling pale, starts wild affright
 confused precipitates flight:
 king shining warrior flies,
 plunged amid thickest trojans lies.
 
godlike hector sees prince retreat,
 thus upbraids generous heat:
 “unhappy paris![111] women brave!
 fairly form’d, deceive!
 oh, hadst thou died first thou saw’st light,
 died least thy nuptial rite!
 better fate vainly thus boast,
 fly, scandal thy trojan host.
 gods! scornful greeks exult see
 fears danger undeceived thee!
 thy figure promised martial air,
 ill thy soul supplies form fair.
 former days, thy gallant pride,
 thy tall ships triumphant stemm’d tide,
 greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,
 crowds stood wondering passing show,
 say, thus, baffled mien,
 met approaches spartan queen,
 thus realm convey’d beauteous prize,
 warlike lords outshined helen’s eyes?
 deed, thy foes’ delight, thy disgrace,
 thy father’s grief, ruin thy race;
 deed recalls thee proffer’d fight;
 hast thou injured thou dar’st right?
 soon thy cost field make thee know
 thou keep’st consort braver foe.
 thy graceful form instilling soft desire,
 thy curling tresses, thy silver lyre,
 beauty youth; vain trust,
 youth beauty shall laid dust:
 troy yet may wake, one avenging blow
 crush dire author country’s woe.”
 
silence here, blushes, paris breaks:
 “’tis just, brother, anger speaks:
 like thee can boast soul sedate,
 firmly proof shocks fate?
 thy force, like steel, temper’d hardness shows,
 still edged wound, still untired blows,
 like steel, uplifted strenuous swain,
 falling woods strew wasted plain.
 thy gifts praise; thou despise charms
 lover golden venus arms;
 soft moving speech, pleasing outward show,
 wish can gain them, gods bestow.
 yet, would’st thou proffer’d combat stand,
 greeks trojans seat either hand;
 let midway space hosts divide,
 and, stage war, cause tried:
 paris spartan king fought,
 beauteous helen wealth brought;
 rival can arms subdue,
 fair, treasure too.
 thus lasting league toils may cease,
 troy possess fertile fields peace;
 thus may greeks review native shore,
 much famed generous steeds, beauty more.”
 
said. challenge hector heard joy,
 spear restrain’d youth troy,
 held midst, athwart; near foe
 advanced steps majestically slow:
 round dauntless head grecians pour
 stones arrows mingled shower.
 
thus monarch, great atrides, cried:
 “forbear, ye warriors! lay darts aside:
 parley hector asks, message bears;
 know various plume wears.”
 awed high command greeks attend,
 tumult silence, fight suspend.
 
centre hector rolls eyes
 either host, thus applies:
 “hear, ye trojan, ye grecian bands,
 paris, author war, demands.
 shining swords within sheath restrain,
 pitch lances yielding plain.
 midst, either army’s sight,
 dares spartan king single fight;
 wills helen ravish’d spoil,
 caused contest, shall reward toil.
 let brave triumphant victor grace,
 different nations part leagues peace.”
 
spoke: still suspense either side
 army stood: spartan chief replied:
 
“me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right
 world engages toils fight.
 labour field resign;
 paris injured; war mine.
 fall must, beneath rival’s arms;
 live rest, secure future harms.
 two lambs, devoted country’s rite,
 earth sable, sun white,
 prepare, ye trojans! third bring
 select jove, inviolable king.
 let reverend priam truce engage,
 add sanction considerate age;
 sons faithless, headlong debate,
 youth empty wavering state;
 cool age advances, venerably wise,
 turns hands deep-discerning eyes;
 sees befell, may yet befall,
 concludes both, best provides all.
 
nations hear rising hopes possess’d,
 peaceful prospects dawn every breast.
 within lines drew steeds around,
 chariots issued ground;
 next, unbuckling rich mail wore,
 laid bright arms along sable shore.
 either side meeting hosts seen
 lances fix’d, close space between.
 two heralds now, despatch’d troy, invite
 phrygian monarch peaceful rite.
 
talthybius hastens fleet, bring
 lamb jove, inviolable king.
 
meantime beauteous helen, skies

 golden web sad story crown’d,

 “approach, view wondrous scene below![112]
 hardy greek, valiant trojan knight,
 dreadful late, furious fight,
 now rest spears, lean upon shields;
 ceased war, silent fields.
 paris alone sparta’s king advance,
 single fight toss beamy lance;
 met arms, fate combat tries,
 thy love motive, thy charms prize.”
 
said, many-coloured maid inspires
 husband’s love, wakes former fires;
 country, parents, dear,
 rush thought, force tender tear,
 o’er fair face snowy veil threw,
 and, softly sighing, loom withdrew.

 king first; thymœtes side;
 lampus clytius, long council tried;
 panthus, hicetaon, strong;
 next, wisest reverend throng,
 antenor grave, sage ucalegon,
 lean’d walls bask’d sun:
 chiefs, bloody fights engage,
 wise time, narrative age,
 summer days, like grasshoppers rejoice,
 bloodless race, send feeble voice.

 secret own’d resistless beauty’s power:
 cried, “no wonder[113] celestial charms
 nine long years set world arms;
 winning graces! majestic mien!
 moves goddess, looks queen!
 yet hence, heaven, convey fatal face,
 destruction save trojan race.”
 
good old priam welcomed her, cried,
 “approach, child, grace thy father’s side.
 see plain thy grecian spouse appears,
 friends kindred thy former years.

 thou, heaven’s disposing will, cause

 (far hence aged orbs can see)
 around whose brow martial graces shine,
 tall, awful, almost divine!
 though larger stature tread green,
 none match grandeur exalted mien:
 seems monarch, country’s pride.”
 thus ceased king, thus fair replied:
 
“before thy presence, father, appear,
 conscious shame reverential fear.
 ah! died, ere walls fled,
 false country, nuptial bed;
 brothers, friends, daughter left behind,
 false all, paris kind!
 mourn, till grief dire disease
 shall waste form whose fault please!
 king kings, atrides, survey,
 great war, great arts sway:

 oh! still bore brother’s name!”
 
wonder priam view’d godlike man,
 extoll’d happy prince, thus began:
 “o bless’d atrides! born prosperous fate,
 successful monarch mighty state!
 vast thy empire! matchless train
 numbers lost, numbers yet remain!
 phrygia gallant armies known,
 ancient time, otreus fill’d throne,
 godlike mygdon led troops horse,
 i, join them, raised trojan force:
 manlike amazons stood,[114]
 sangar’s stream ran purple blood.
 far inferior those, martial grace,
 strength numbers, grecian race.”
 
said, view’d warrior train;
 “what’s he, whose arms lie scatter’d plain?
 broad breast, shoulders larger spread,
 though great atrides overtops head.
 yet appear care conduct small;
 rank rank moves, orders all.
 stately ram thus measures o’er ground,
 and, master flock, surveys round.”
 
helen thus: “whom discerning eyes
 singled out, ithacus wise;
 barren island boasts glorious birth;
 fame wisdom fills spacious earth.”
 
antenor took word, thus began:[115]
 “myself, king! seen wondrous man
 when, trusting jove hospitable laws,
 troy came, plead grecian cause;
 (great menelaus urged request;)
 house honour’d royal guest:
 knew persons, admired parts,
 brave arms, approved arts.
 erect, spartan engaged view;
 ulysses seated, greater reverence drew.
 atreus’ harangued listening train,
 just sense, expression plain,
 words succinct, yet full, without fault;
 spoke just thing ought.
 ulysses rose, thought profound,[116]
 modest eyes fix’d upon ground;
 one unskill’d dumb, seem’d stand,
 raised head, stretch’d sceptred hand;
 but, speaks, elocution flows!
 soft fleeces descending snows,[117]
 copious accents fall, easy art;
 melting fall, sink heart!
 wondering hear, fix’d deep surprise,
 ears refute censure eyes.”
 
king ask’d (as yet camp view’d)
 “what chief that, giant strength endued,
 whose brawny shoulders, whose swelling chest,
 lofty stature, far exceed rest?
 “ajax great, (the beauteous queen replied,)
 host: grecian strength pride.

 perhaps chiefs, warlike toils ease,
 distant troy refused sail seas;
 perhaps swords nobler quarrel draws,

spoke fair, knew brothers’ doom;[118]
 wrapt cold embraces tomb;
 adorn’d honours native shore,
 silent slept, heard wars more.
 
meantime heralds, crowded town,
 bring rich wine destined victims down.
 idæus’ arms golden goblets press’d,[119]
 thus venerable king address’d:
 “arise, father trojan state!
 nations call, thy joyful people wait
 seal truce, end dire debate.
 paris, thy son, sparta’s king advance,
 measured lists toss weighty lance;
 rival shall arms subdue,
 dame, treasure too.
 thus lasting league toils may cease,
 troy possess fertile fields peace:
 shall greeks review native shore,

grief heard, bade chiefs prepare
 join milk-white coursers car;

 pour full urn; draws grecian lord
 cutlass sheathed beside ponderous sword;
 sign’d victims crops curling hair;[121]
 heralds part it, princes share;
 loudly thus attentive bands

“o first greatest power! obey,

chief tender victims slew,

 thus prayers united mount sky,
 “hear, mighty jove! hear, ye gods high!

 lust scatter’d dust!”
 thus either host imprecations join’d,
 jove refused, mingled wind.

 thus express’d heart o’ercharged woes:
 “ye greeks trojans, let chiefs engage,

now round lists admiring armies stand,

 amidst dreadful vale, chiefs advance,

“give me, great jove! punish lawless lust,

 said, poised air javelin sent,
 paris’ shield forceful weapon went,
 corslet pierces, garment rends,
 glancing downward, near flank descends.
 wary trojan, bending blow,
 eludes death, disappoints foe:
 fierce atrides waved sword, strook
 full casque: crested helmet shook;
 brittle steel, unfaithful hand,
 broke short: fragments glitter’d sand.
 raging warrior spacious skies
 raised upbraiding voice angry eyes:
 “then vain jove trust?
 thus gods assist just?
 crimes provoke us, heaven success denies;
 dart falls harmless, falchion flies.”
 furious said, towards grecian crew
 (seized crest) unhappy warrior drew;
 struggling followed, embroider’d thong
 tied helmet, dragg’d chief along.
 ruin crown’d atrides’ joy,
 venus trembled prince troy:
 unseen came, burst golden band;
 left empty helmet hand.

 greeks smiles polish’d trophy view.
 then, lifts deadly dart,
 thirst vengeance, rival’s heart;
 queen love favour’d champion shrouds
 (for gods can things) veil clouds.
 raised field panting youth led,
 gently laid bridal bed,
 pleasing sweets fainting sense renews,
 dome perfumes heavenly dews.
 meantime brightest female kind,
 matchless helen, o’er walls reclined;
 her, beset trojan beauties, came,
 borrow’d form, laughter-loving dame.
 (she seem’d ancient maid, well-skill’d cull
 snowy fleece, wind twisted wool.)
 goddess softly shook silken vest,
 shed perfumes, whispering thus address’d:
 

[illustration: ] venus, disguised, inviting helen chamber of
 paris
 

“haste, happy nymph! thee thy paris calls,
 safe fight, yonder lofty walls,
 fair god; odours round spread,
 lies, waits thee well-known bed;
 like warrior parted foe,
 gay dancer public show.”
 
spoke, helen’s secret soul moved;
 scorn’d champion, man loved.
 fair venus’ neck, eyes sparkled fire,
 breast, reveal’d queen soft desire.[123]
 struck presence, straight lively red
 forsook cheek; trembling, thus said:
 “then still thy pleasure deceive?
 woman’s frailty always believe!
 say, new nations must cross main,
 carry wars soft asian plain?
 must helen break second vow?
 paris thy darling now?
 left atrides, (victor strife,)
 odious conquest captive wife,
 hence let sail; thy paris bear
 absence ill, let venus ease care.
 handmaid goddess side wait,
 renounce glories thy heavenly state,
 fix’d ever trojan shore,
 spouse, slave; mount skies more.
 me, lawless love longer led,
 scorn coward, detest bed;
 else merit everlasting shame,
 keen reproach, every phrygian dame:
 ill suits now joys love know,
 deep anguish, wild woe.”
 

[illustration: ] venus presenting helen paris
 

thus incensed, paphian queen replies:
 “obey power thy glories rise:
 venus leave thee, every charm must fly,
 fade thy cheek, languish thy eye.
 cease provoke me, lest make thee more
 world’s aversion, love before;
 now bright prize mankind engage,
 than, sad victim, public rage.”
 
this, fairest sex obey’d,
 veil’d blushes silken shade;
 unseen, silent, train moves,
 led goddess smiles loves.
 arrived, enter’d palace gate,
 maids officious round mistress wait;
 then, dispersing, various tasks attend;
 queen goddess prince ascend.
 full paris’ sight, queen love
 placed beauteous progeny jove;
 where, view’d charms, turn’d away
 glowing eyes, thus began say:
 
“is chief, who, lost sense shame,
 late fled field, yet survives fame?
 hadst thou died beneath righteous sword
 brave man call’d lord!
 boaster paris oft desired day
 sparta’s king meet single fray:
 go now, thy rival’s rage excite,
 provoke atrides, renew fight:
 yet helen bids thee stay, lest thou unskill’d
 shouldst fall easy conquest field.”
 
prince replies: “ah cease, divinely fair,
 add reproaches wounds bear;
 day foe prevail’d pallas’ power:
 yet may vanquish happier hour:
 want gods favour us above;
 let business life love:
 softer moments let delights employ,
 kind embraces snatch hasty joy.
 thus loved thee, sparta’s shore
 forced, willing heavenly prize bore,
 first entranced cranae’s isle lay,[124]
 mix’d thy soul, dissolved away!”
 thus spoke, enamour’d phrygian boy
 rush’d bed, impatient joy.
 helen follow’d slow bashful charms,
 clasp’d blooming hero arms.
 
love’s delicious rapture yield,
 stern atrides rages round field:
 fell lion woods obey,
 roars desert, demands prey.
 paris seeks, impatient destroy,
 seeks vain along troops troy;
 even yielded foe brave
 recreant warrior, hateful grave.
 speaking thus, king kings arose,
 “ye trojans, dardans, generous foes!
 hear attest! heaven conquest crown’d,
 brother’s arms just success found:
 therefore now spartan wealth restor’d,
 let argive helen lawful lord;
 appointed fine let ilion justly pay,
 age age record signal day.”
 
ceased; army’s loud applauses rise,
 long shout runs echoing skies.

thus spoke, queen heaven, enraged,

 though secret anger swell’d minerva’s breast,
 prudent goddess yet wrath suppress’d;
 juno, impotent passion, broke

 “let thy words warmth greece abate;

words allay impetuous warrior’s heat,
 god arms martial maid retreat;
 removed fight, xanthus’ flowery bounds
 sat, listen’d dying sounds.
 
meantime, greeks trojan race pursue,
 bold chieftain every leader slew:
 first odius falls, bites bloody sand,
 death ennobled atrides’ hand:

 speedy javelin drove back breast.

thus toil’d chiefs, different parts engaged.
 every quarter fierce tydides raged;
 amid greek, amid trojan train,
 rapt ranks thunders o’er plain;
 now here, now there, darts place place,
 pours rear, lightens face.
 thus high hills torrents swift strong
 deluge whole fields, sweep trees along,
 ruin’d moles rushing wave resounds,

 yellow harvests ripen’d year,
 flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear![144]
 jove descends sluicy sheets rain,

raged tydides, boundless ire,
 drove armies back, made troy retire.
 grief leader lycian band
 saw wide waste destructive hand:
 bended bow chief drew;
 swift mark thirsty arrow flew,
 whose forky point hollow breastplate tore,
 deep shoulder pierced, drank gore:
 rushing stream brazen armour dyed,
 proud archer thus exulting cried:
 
“hither, ye trojans, hither drive steeds!
 lo! hand bravest grecian bleeds,
 long deathful dart can sustain;
 phœbus urged fields vain.”
 spoke he, boastful: winged dart
 stopp’d short life, mock’d shooter’s art.
 wounded chief, behind car retired,
 helping hand sthenelus required;
 swift seat leap’d upon ground,
 tugg’d weapon gushing wound;
 thus king guardian power address’d,
 purple current wandering o’er vest:
 
“o progeny jove! unconquer’d maid!
 e’er godlike sire deserved thy aid,
 e’er felt thee fighting field;
 now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.

 whose arrow wounds chief thou guard’st fight;

thus pray’d tydides, minerva heard,
 nerves confirm’d, languid spirits cheer’d;
 feels limb wonted vigour light;
 beating bosom claim’d promised fight.
 “be bold, (she cried), every combat shine,
 war thy province, thy protection mine;
 rush fight, every foe control;
 wake paternal virtue thy soul:
 strength swells thy boiling breast, infused me,
 thy godlike father breathes thee;
 yet more, mortal mists purge thy eyes,[145]
 set view warring deities.
 see thou shun, embattled plain;
 rashly strive human force vain.
 venus mingle martial band,
 shalt thou wound: pallas gives command.”
 
that, blue-eyed virgin wing’d flight;
 hero rush’d impetuous fight;
 tenfold ardour now invades plain,
 wild delay, enraged pain.
 fleecy flocks hunger calls,
 amidst field brindled lion falls;
 chance shepherd distant dart
 savage wound, rouses smart,
 foams, roars; shepherd dares stay,
 trembling leaves scattering flocks prey;
 heaps fall heaps; bathes blood ground,
 leaps victorious o’er lofty mound.
 less fury stern tydides flew;
 two brave leaders instant slew;
 astynous breathless fell, side,
 people’s pastor, good hypenor, died;
 astynous’ breast deadly lance receives,
 hypenor’s shoulder broad falchion cleaves.
 slain left, sprung noble rage
 abas polyidus engage;
 sons eurydamus, who, wise old,
 fate foresee, mystic dreams unfold;
 youths return’d doubtful plain,
 sad father tried arts vain;

 though now determined tydides’ spear.
 
young xanthus next, thoon felt rage;
 joy hope phaenops’ feeble age:
 vast wealth, heirs
 labours life cares.
 cold death o’ertakes blooming years,
 leaves father unavailing tears:
 strangers now descends heapy store,

two sons priam one chariot ride,

 foe prevailing, friends pursued;
 thick storm singing spears flies,
 exploring pandarus careful eyes.
 length found lycaon’s mighty son;
 chief venus’ race begun:
 
“where, pandarus, thy honours now,
 thy winged arrows unerring bow,
 thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall’d fame,

 god incensed, quits distant skies
 punish troy slighted sacrifice;
 (which, oh avert unhappy state!
 dreadful celestial hate)?
 whoe’er be, propitiate jove prayer;
 man, destroy; god, entreat spare.”
 
lycian: “whom eyes behold,

 ’tis god, wears chief’s disguise:

 vain youth, yet thrift inclined,
 heard counsels unheedful mind,
 thought steeds (your large supplies unknown)
 might fail forage straiten’d town;
 took bow pointed darts hand
 left chariots native land.
 
“too late, friend! rashness deplore;

leader dardan race:
 “be calm, phœbus’ honour’d gift disgrace.

 yon hero let us bend course,
 and, hand hand, encounter force force.
 now mount seat, chariot’s height
 observe father’s steeds, renown’d fight;
 practised alike turn, stop, chase,
 dare shock, urge rapid race;
 secure these, fighting fields go;
 safe troy, jove assist foe.
 haste, seize whip, snatch guiding rein;
 warrior’s fury let arm sustain;
 or, combat thy bold heart incline,
 take thou spear, chariot’s care mine.”
 
“o prince! (lycaon’s valiant replied)

 but, if, unhappy, desert fight,
 thy voice alone can animate flight;
 else shall fates number’d dead,

now heroes mount glittering car;
 bounding coursers rush amidst war;
 fierce approach bold sthenelus espied,
 thus, alarm’d, great tydides cried:
 
“o friend! two chiefs force immense see,

 brave heir old lycaon’s line,

 hence great anchises stole breed unknown,

thus spoke, foe came furious on,
 stern lycaon’s warlike race begun:
 
“prince, thou art met. though late vain assail’d,
 spear may enter arrow fail’d.”
 
said, shook ponderous lance, flung;
 broad shield sounding weapon rung,
 pierced tough orb, cuirass hung,
 “he bleeds! pride greece! (the boaster cries,)
 triumph now, mighty warrior lies!”
 “mistaken vaunter! (diomed replied;)
 thy dart erred, now spear tried;
 ye ’scape both; one, headlong car,
 hostile blood shall glut god war.”
 
spoke, rising hurl’d forceful dart,
 which, driven pallas, pierced vital part;
 full face enter’d, betwixt
 nose eye-ball proud lycian fix’d;
 crash’d jaws, cleft tongue within,
 till bright point look’d beneath chin.

 haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten’d state,
 one vast burst all-involving fate
 full o’er towers shall fall, sweep away
 sons, sires, wives, undistinguish’d prey.
 rouse thy trojans, urge thy aids fight;
 claim thy thoughts day, thy watch night;
 force incessant brave greeks oppose;
 cares thy friends deserve, thy foes.”
 
stung heart generous hector hears,
 just reproof decent silence bears.
 proud car prince impetuous springs,
 earth leaps, brazen armour rings.
 two shining spears brandish’d hands;
 thus arm’d, animates drooping bands,
 revives ardour, turns steps flight,
 wakes anew dying flames fight.
 turn, stand; greeks fury dare,
 condense powers, wait growing war.
 
when, ceres’ sacred floor, swain
 spreads wide fan clear golden grain,
 light chaff, breezes borne,
 ascends clouds heapy corn;
 grey dust, rising collected winds,
 drives o’er barn, whitens hinds:
 white dust grecian host appears,
 trampling steeds, thundering charioteers.
 dusky clouds labour’d earth arise,
 roll smoking volumes skies.
 mars hovers o’er sable shield,
 adds new horrors darken’d field:
 pleased charge, ardent fulfil,
 troy’s defence, apollo’s heavenly will:
 soon fight blue-eyed maid retires,
 trojan bosom new warmth fires.
 now god, forth sacred fane,
 produced Æneas shouting train;
 alive, unharm’d, peers around,
 erect stood, vigorous wound:
 inquiries none made; dreadful day
 pause words admits, dull delay;
 fierce discord storms, apollo loud exclaims,
 fame calls, mars thunders, field’s flames.
 
stern diomed either ajax stood,
 great ulysses, bathed hostile blood.
 embodied close, labouring grecian train
 fiercest shock charging hosts sustain.
 unmoved silent, whole war wait
 serenely dreadful, fix’d fate.
 embattled clouds dark array,
 along skies gloomy lines display;
 now north boisterous rage spent,
 peaceful sleeps liquid element:
 low-hung vapours, motionless still,
 rest summits shaded hill;
 till mass scatters winds arise,
 dispersed broken ruffled skies.
 
general wanting train;
 troop troop toils plain,
 “ye greeks, men! charge battle bear;
 brave associates revere!
 let glorious acts glorious acts inspire,
 catch breast breast noble fire!
 valour’s side odds combat lie,
 brave live glorious, lamented die;
 wretch trembles field fame,
 meets death, worse death, eternal shame!”
 
words seconds flying lance,
 meet whose point strong deicoon’s chance:
 Æneas’ friend, native place
 honour’d loved like priam’s royal race:
 long fought foremost field,
 now monarch’s lance transpierced shield:
 shield weak furious dart stay,
 broad belt weapon forced way:
 grisly wound dismiss’d soul hell,
 arms around rattled fell.
 
fierce Æneas, brandishing blade,
 dust orsilochus crethon laid,
 whose sire diocleus, wealthy, brave great,
 well-built pheræ held lofty seat:[152]
 sprung alpheus’ plenteous stream, yields
 increase harvests pylian fields.
 got orsilochus, diocleus he,
 descended third degree.
 early expert martial toil,
 sable ships left native soil,
 avenge atrides: now, untimely slain,
 fell glory phrygian plain.
 two young mountain lions, nursed blood
 deep recesses gloomy wood,
 rush fearless plains, uncontroll’d
 depopulate stalls waste fold:
 till pierced distance native den,
 o’erpowered fall beneath force men.
 prostrate earth beauteous bodies lay,
 like mountain firs, tall straight they.
 great menelaus views pitying eyes,
 lifts bright lance, victor flies;
 mars urged on; yet, ruthless hate,
 god urged provoke fate.
 thus advancing, nestor’s valiant son
 shakes danger, neglects own;
 struck thought, helen’s lord slain,
 country’s glorious labours vain.
 already met, threatening heroes stand;
 spears already tremble hand:
 rush’d antilochus, aid bring,
 fall conquer spartan king.
 seen, dardan backward turn’d course,
 brave was, shunn’d unequal force.
 breathless bodies greeks drew,
 mix combat, toils renew.
 
first, pylæmenes, great battle, bled,
 sheathed brass paphlagonians led.
 atrides mark’d sublime stood;
 fix’d throat javelin drank blood.
 faithful mydon, turn’d fight
 flying coursers, sunk endless night;
 broken rock nestor’s thrown:
 bended arm received falling stone;
 numb’d hand ivory-studded reins,
 dropp’d dust, trail’d along plains:
 meanwhile temples feel deadly wound;
 groans death, ponderous sinks ground:
 deep drove helmet sands, there
 head stood fix’d, quivering legs air,
 till trampled flat beneath coursers’ feet:
 youthful victor mounts empty seat,
 bears prize triumph fleet.
 
great hector saw, and, raging view,
 pours greeks: trojan troops pursue:
 fires host animating cries,
 brings along furies skies,
 mars, stern destroyer! bellona dread,
 flame front, thunder head:
 swells tumult rage fight;
 shakes spear casts dreadful light.
 hector march’d, god battles shined,
 now storm’d him, now raged behind.
 
tydides paused amidst full career;
 first hero’s manly breast knew fear.
 simple swain cot forsakes,
 wide fens unknown journey takes:
 chance swelling brook passage stay,
 foam impervious ’cross wanderer’s way,
 confused stops, length country pass’d,
 eyes rough waves, tired, returns last.
 amazed less great tydides stands:
 stay’d, turning thus address’d bands:
 
“no wonder, greeks! hector yield;
 secure favouring gods, takes field;
 strokes second, avert spears.
 behold mars mortal arms appears!
 retire then, warriors, sedate slow;
 retire, faces foe.
 trust much unavailing might;
 ’tis troy, gods ye fight.”
 
now near greeks black battalions drew;
 first two leaders valiant hector slew:
 force anchialus mnesthes found,
 every art glorious war renown’d;
 car chiefs combat ride,
 fought united, united died.
 struck sight, mighty ajax glows
 thirst vengeance, assaults foes.
 massy spear matchless fury sent,
 amphius’ belt heaving belly went;
 amphius apæsus’ happy soil possess’d,
 herds abounding, treasure bless’d;
 fate resistless country led
 chief, perish people’s head.
 shook fall brazen armour rung,
 fierce, seize it, conquering ajax sprung;
 around head iron tempest rain’d;
 wood spears ample shield sustain’d:
 beneath one foot yet warm corpse press’d,
 drew javelin bleeding breast:
 more; showering darts denied
 spoil glittering arms, plumy pride.
 now foes foes came pouring fields,
 bristling lances, compacted shields;
 till steely circle straiten’d round,
 forced gives way, sternly quits ground.
 
thus strive, tlepolemus great,[153]
 urged force unresisted fate,
 burns desire sarpedon’s strength prove;
 alcides’ offspring meets jove.
 sheathed bright arms adverse chief came on.
 jove’s great descendant, greater son.
 prepared combat, ere lance toss’d,
 daring rhodian vents haughty boast:
 
“what brings lycian counsellor far,
 tremble arms, mix war!
 know thy vain self, let flattery move,
 style thee cloud-compelling jove.
 far unlike chiefs race divine,
 vast difference deeds thine!
 jove got heroes sire, whose soul
 fear daunt, earth hell control.
 troy felt arm, yon proud ramparts stand
 raised ruins vengeful hand:
 six small ships, slender train,
 left town wide-deserted plain.
 art thou, deedless look’st around,
 unrevenged thy lycians bite ground!
 small aid troy thy feeble force can be;
 wert thou greater, thou must yield me.
 pierced spear, endless darkness go!
 make present shades below.”
 
hercules, rhodian guide,
 thus haughty spoke. lycian king replied:
 
“thy sire, prince! o’erturn’d trojan state,
 whose perjured monarch well deserved fate;
 heavenly steeds hero sought far,
 false detain’d, just reward war.
 content, generous chief defied,
 base reproaches unmanly pride.
 you, unworthy high race boast,
 shall raise glory thy lost:
 now meet thy fate, sarpedon slain,
 add one ghost pluto’s gloomy reign.”
 
said: javelins instant flew;
 struck, wounded, sarpedon’s slew:
 full boaster’s neck weapon stood,
 transfix’d throat, drank vital blood;
 soul disdainful seeks caves night,
 seal’d eyes ever lose light.
 
yet vain, tlepolemus, thrown
 thy angry lance; piercing bone
 sarpedon’s thigh, robb’d chief breath;
 jove present, forbade death.
 borne conflict lycian throng,
 wounded hero dragg’d lance along.
 (his friends, busied several part,
 haste, danger, drawn dart.)
 greeks slain tlepolemus retired;
 whose fall ulysses view’d, fury fired;
 doubtful jove’s great pursue,
 pour vengeance lycian crew.
 heaven fate first design withstand,
 great death must grace ulysses’ hand.
 minerva drives lycian train;
 alastor, cronius, halius, strew’d plain,
 alcander, prytanis, noëmon fell:[154]
 numbers sword sent hell,
 hector saw; and, furious sight,
 rush’d terrible amidst ranks fight.
 joy sarpedon view’d wish’d relief,
 and, faint, lamenting, thus implored chief:
 
“o suffer foe bear away
 helpless corpse, unassisted prey;
 i, unbless’d, must see more,
 much-loved consort, native shore,
 yet let die ilion’s sacred wall;
 troy, whose cause fell, shall mourn fall.”
 
said, hector chief replies,
 shakes plume, fierce combat flies;
 swift whirlwind, drives scattering foes;
 dyes ground purple goes.
 
beneath beech, jove’s consecrated shade,
 mournful friends divine sarpedon laid:
 brave pelagon, favourite chief, nigh,
 wrench’d javelin sinewy thigh.
 fainting soul stood ready wing’d flight,
 o’er eye-balls swam shades night;
 boreas rising fresh, gentle breath,
 recall’d spirit gates death.
 
generous greeks recede tardy pace,
 though mars hector thunder face;
 none turn backs mean ignoble flight,
 slow retreat, even retreating fight.
 first, last, mars’ hector’s hand,
 stretch’d blood, lay gasping sand?
 tenthras great, orestes renown’d
 managed steeds, trechus press’d ground;
 next Œnomaus oenops’ offspring died;
 oresbius last fell groaning side:
 oresbius, painted mitre gay,
 fat bœotia held wealthy sway,
 lakes surround low hylè’s watery plain;
 prince people studious gain.
 
carnage juno skies survey’d,
 touch’d grief bespoke blue-eyed maid:
 “oh, sight accursed! shall faithless troy prevail,
 shall promise people fail?
 vain word menelaus given
 jove’s great daughter queen heaven,
 beneath arms priam’s towers fall,
 warring gods ever guard wall!
 mars, red slaughter, aids hated foes:
 haste, let us arm, force force oppose!”
 
spoke; minerva burns meet war:
 now heaven’s empress calls blazing car.
 command rush forth steeds divine;
 rich immortal gold trappings shine.
 bright hebe waits; hebe, ever young,
 whirling wheels chariot hung.
 bright axle turns bidden wheel
 sounding brass; polished axle steel.
 eight brazen spokes radiant order flame;
 circles gold, uncorrupted frame,
 heavens produce: round gold
 two brazen rings work divine roll’d.
 bossy naves sold silver shone;
 braces gold suspend moving throne:
 car, behind, arching figure bore;
 bending concave form’d arch before.
 silver beam, extended yoke gold,
 golden reins immortal coursers hold.
 herself, impatient, ready car,
 coursers joins, breathes revenge war.
 
pallas disrobes; radiant veil untied,
 flowers adorn’d, art diversified,
 (the laboured veil heavenly fingers wove,)
 flows pavement court jove.
 now heaven’s dread arms mighty limbs invest,
 jove’s cuirass blazes ample breast;
 deck’d sad triumph mournful field,
 o’er broad shoulders hangs horrid shield,
 dire, black, tremendous! round margin roll’d,
 fringe serpents hissing guards gold:
 terrors grim war appear,
 rages force, tremble flight fear,
 storm’d contention, fury frown’d,
 dire orb portentous gorgon crown’d.
 massy golden helm next assumes,
 dreadful nods four o’ershading plumes;
 vast, broad circumference contains
 hundred armies hundred plains.
 goddess thus imperial car ascends;
 shook arm mighty javelin bends,
 ponderous huge; fury burns,
 proud tyrants humbles, whole hosts o’erturns.
 
swift scourge ethereal coursers fly,
 smooth chariot cuts liquid sky.
 heaven’s gates spontaneous open powers,[155]
 heaven’s golden gates, kept winged hours;[156]

 sun’s bright portals skies command,

 dark barrier roll ease away.
 sounding hinges ring, either side
 gloomy volumes, pierced light, divide.
 chariot mounts, deep ambient skies,
 confused, olympus’ hundred heads arise;
 far apart thunderer fills throne,
 o’er gods superior alone.
 snowy hand queen restrains
 fiery steeds, thus jove complains:
 
“o sire! can resentment touch thy soul?
 can mars rebel, thunder roll?
 lawless rage yon forbidden plain,
 rash destruction! heroes slain!
 venus, phœbus dreadful bow,

 mad, furious power! whose unrelenting mind
 god can govern, justice bind.

assenting, thus thunderer said:
 “go! great minerva thy aid.
 tame monster-god minerva knows,
 oft afflicts brutal breast woes.”
 
said; saturnia, ardent obey,
 lash’d white steeds along aerial way.
 swift steep heaven chariot rolls,

best bravest grecian band
 (a warlike circle) round tydides stand.
 look lions bathed blood,
 foaming boars, terror wood.
 heaven’s empress mingles mortal crowd,
 shouts, stentor’s sounding voice, aloud;
 stentor strong, endued brazen lungs,[158]
 whose throats surpass’d force fifty tongues.
 
“inglorious argives! race shame,
 men figure name!
 walls timorous foes engaged,
 fierce war divine achilles raged;
 now issuing fearless possess plain,
 now win shores, scarce seas remain.”
 
speech new fury hearts convey’d;
 near tydides stood athenian maid;
 king beside panting steeds found,
 o’erspent toil reposing ground;
 cool glowing wound sat apart,
 (the wound inflicted lycian dart.)
 large drops sweat limbs descend,
 beneath ponderous shield sinews bend,
 whose ample belt, o’er shoulder lay,
 eased; wash’d clotted gore away.
 goddess leaning o’er bending yoke,
 beside coursers, thus silence broke:
 
“degenerate prince! tydeus’ kind,
 whose little body lodged mighty mind;
 foremost press’d glorious toils share,
 scarce refrain’d forbade war.
 alone, unguarded, dared go,
 feast, incircled theban foe;
 braved, vanquish’d, many hardy knight;
 nerves gave him, force fight.
 thou less hast constant care;
 thy hands arm’d, sent thee forth war:
 thee fear deters, sloth detains;
 drop thy father warms thy veins.”
 
chief thus answered mild: “immortal maid!
 thy presence, confess thy aid.
 fear, thou know’st, withholds plains,
 sloth hath seized me, thy word restrains:
 warring gods thou bad’st turn spear,
 venus found resistance here.
 hence, goddess! heedful thy high commands,
 loth gave way, warn’d argive bands:
 mars, homicide, eyes beheld,
 slaughter red, raging round field.”
 
thus minerva:—“brave tydides, hear!
 mars himself, aught immortal, fear.
 full god impel thy foaming horse:
 pallas commands, pallas lends thee force.
 rash, furious, blind, flies,
 every side wavering combat tries;
 large promise makes, breaks promise made:
 now gives grecians, now trojans aid.”[159]
 
said, steeds approaching near,
 drew seat martial charioteer.
 vigorous power trembling car ascends,
 fierce revenge; diomed attends:
 groaning axle bent beneath load;
 great hero, great god.
 snatch’d reins, lash’d force,
 full mars impelled foaming horse:
 first, hide heavenly visage, spread
 black orcus’ helmet o’er radiant head.

just gigantic periphas lay slain,

 god, slew him, leaves prostrate prize
 stretch’d fell, tydides flies.
 now rushing fierce, equal arms appear
 daring greek, dreadful god war!
 full chief, courser’s head,
 mars’s arm enormous weapon fled:
 pallas opposed hand, caused glance
 far car strong immortal lance.
 threw force tydeus’ warlike son;
 javelin hiss’d; goddess urged on:
 broad cincture girt armour round,

 rent skin warrior tugs again

 armies start, trembling gaze around;

 vapours blown auster’s sultry breath,
 pregnant plagues, shedding seeds death,
 beneath rage burning sirius rise,
 choke parch’d earth, blacken skies;
 cloud god combat driven,

 wild pain, sought bright abodes,
 sullen sat beneath sire gods,

 thus pour’d plaints immortal throne:
 
“can jove, supine, flagitious facts survey,

 mortal men celestial powers engage,
 gods gods exert eternal rage:
 thee, father! ills bear,
 thy fell daughter shield spear;
 thou gavest fury realms light,
 pernicious, wild, regardless right.
 heaven beside reveres thy sovereign sway,
 thy voice hear, thy behests obey:
 ’tis offend, even offending share
 thy breast, thy counsels, thy distinguish’d care:
 boundless she, thou partial grown,
 well may deem wondrous birth thy own.
 now frantic diomed, command,
 immortals lifts raging hand:
 heavenly venus first fury found,

 vanquish’d fled; even i, god fight,
 mortal madness scarce saved flight.
 else hadst thou seen sink yonder plain,
 heap’d round, heaving loads slain!
 pierced grecian darts, ages lie,
 condemn’d pain, though fated die.”
 
thus upbraiding, wrathful look
 lord thunders view’d, stern bespoke:
 “to me, perfidious! lamenting strain?
 lawless force shall lawless mars complain?
 gods tread spangled skies,
 thou unjust, odious eyes!
 inhuman discord thy dire delight,

episodes glaucus diomed, hector andromache.
 

gods left field, grecians prevail. helenus, the
 chief augur troy, commands hector return city, order to
 appoint solemn procession queen trojan matrons the
 temple minerva, entreat remove diomed fight. the
 battle relaxing absence hector, glaucus diomed have
 interview two armies; where, coming knowledge, of
 friendship hospitality passed ancestors, they
 make exchange arms. hector, performed orders of
 helenus, prevails upon paris return battle, and, taking a
 tender leave wife andromache, hastens field.
 scene first field battle, rivers
 simois scamander, changes troy.
 

now heaven forsakes fight: immortals yield
 human force human skill field:
 dark showers javelins fly foes foes;
 now here, now there, tide combat flows;
 troy’s famed streams, bound deathful plain
 either side, run purple main.
 
great ajax first conquest led way,
 broke thick ranks, turn’d doubtful day.
 thracian acamas falchion found,
 hew’d enormous giant ground;
 thundering arm deadly stroke impress’d
 black horse-hair nodded o’er crest;
 fix’d front brazen weapon lies,
 seals endless shades swimming eyes.
 next teuthras’ distain’d sands blood,
 axylus, hospitable, rich, good:
 fair arisbe’s walls (his native place)[161]
 held seat! friend human race.
 fast road, ever-open door
 obliged wealthy, relieved poor.
 stern tydides now falls prey,
 friend guard dreadful day!
 breathless good man fell, side
 faithful servant, old calesius died.
 
great euryalus dresus slain,
 next laid opheltius plain.
 two twins near, bold, beautiful, young,
 fair naiad bucolion sprung:
 (laomedon’s white flocks bucolion fed,
 monarch’s first-born foreign bed;
 secret woods won naiad’s grace,
 two fair infants crown’d strong embrace:)
 dead lay youthful charms;
 ruthless victor stripp’d shining arms.
 
astyalus polypœtes fell;
 ulysses’ spear pidytes sent hell;
 teucer’s shaft brave aretaon bled,
 nestor’s laid stern ablerus dead;
 great agamemnon, leader brave,
 mortal wound rich elatus gave,
 held pedasus proud abode,[162]
 till’d banks silver satnio flow’d.
 melanthius eurypylus slain;
 phylacus leitus flies vain.
 
unbless’d adrastus next mercy lies
 beneath spartan spear, living prize.
 scared din tumult fight,
 headlong steeds, precipitate flight,
 rush’d tamarisk’s strong trunk, broke
 shatter’d chariot crooked yoke;
 wide o’er field, resistless wind,
 troy fly, leave lord behind.
 prone face sinks beside wheel:
 atrides o’er shakes vengeful steel;
 fallen chief suppliant posture press’d
 victor’s knees, thus prayer address’d:
 
“o spare youth, life owe
 large gifts price father shall bestow.
 fame shall tell, that, battle slain,
 thy hollow ships captive detain:
 rich heaps brass shall thy tent told,[163]
 steel well-temper’d, persuasive gold.”
 
said: compassion touch’d hero’s heart
 stood, suspended lifted dart:
 pity pleaded vanquish’d prize,
 stern agamemnon swift vengeance flies,
 and, furious, thus: “oh impotent mind![164]
 shall these, shall atrides’ mercy find?
 well hast thou known proud troy’s perfidious land,
 well natives merit thy hand!
 one race, sex, age,
 shall save trojan boundless rage:
 ilion shall perish whole, bury all;
 babes, infants breast, shall fall;[165]
 dreadful lesson exampled fate,
 warn nations, curb great!”
 
monarch spoke; words, warmth address’d,
 rigid justice steel’d brother’s breast.
 fierce knees hapless chief thrust;
 monarch’s javelin stretch’d dust,
 pressing foot panting heart,
 forth slain tugg’d reeking dart.
 old nestor saw, roused warrior’s rage;
 “thus, heroes! thus vigorous combat wage;
 mars descend, servile gains,
 touch booty, foe remains.
 behold yon glittering host, future spoil!
 first gain conquest, reward toil.”
 
now greece eternal fame acquired,
 frighted troy within walls, retired,
 sage helenus state redress’d,
 taught gods moved sacred breast.
 hector stood, great Æneas join’d,
 seer reveal’d counsels mind:
 
“ye generous chiefs! immortals lay
 cares glories doubtful day;
 aids, country’s hopes depend;
 wise consult, active defend!
 here, gates, brave efforts unite,
 turn back routed, forbid flight,
 ere yet wives’ soft arms cowards gain,
 sport insult hostile train.
 commands hearten’d every band,
 ourselves, fix’d, will make dangerous stand;
 press’d are, sore former fight,
 straits demand last remains might.
 meanwhile thou, hector, town retire,
 teach mother gods require:
 direct queen lead assembled train
 troy’s chief matrons minerva’s fane;[166]
 unbar sacred gates, seek power,
 offer’d vows, ilion’s topmost tower.
 largest mantle rich wardrobes hold,
 prized art, labour’d o’er gold,
 goddess’ honour’d knees spread,
 twelve young heifers altars led:
 power, atoned fervent prayer,
 wives, infants, city spare,
 far avert tydides’ wasteful ire,
 mows whole troops, makes troy retire;
 thus achilles taught hosts dread,
 sprung though mortal bed;
 thus resistless ruled stream fight,
 rage unbounded, unmatch’d might.”
 
hector obedient heard: and, bound,
 leap’d trembling chariot ground;
 host inspiring force flies,
 bids thunder battle rise.
 rage recruited bold trojans glow,
 turn tide conflict foe:
 fierce front shakes two dazzling spears;
 greece recedes, ’midst triumphs fears;
 god, thought, ruled fate wars,
 shot avenging vault stars.
 
thus aloud: “ye dauntless dardans, hear!
 distant nations send war!
 mindful strength fathers bore;
 still yourselves, hector asks more.
 one hour demands trojan wall,
 bid altars flame, victims fall:
 shall, trust, matrons’ holy train,
 reverend elders, seek gods vain.”
 
said, ample strides hero pass’d;
 shield’s large orb behind shoulder cast,
 neck o’ershading, ankle hung;
 march’d brazen buckler rung.
 
now paused battle (godlike hector gone),[167]
 daring glaucus great tydeus’ son
 armies met: chiefs far
 observed other, mark’d war.
 near drew, tydides thus began:
 
“what art thou, boldest race man?
 eyes till now aspect ne’er beheld,
 fame reap’d amid embattled field;
 yet far troops thou dar’st appear,
 meet lance fiercest heroes fear.
 unhappy they, born luckless sires,
 tempt fury minerva fires!
 heaven, celestial, thou descend,
 know immortals contend.
 long lycurgus view’d golden light,
 daring man mix’d gods fight.
 bacchus, bacchus’ votaries, drove,
 brandish’d steel, nyssa’s sacred grove:
 consecrated spears lay scatter’d round,
 curling vines twisted ivy bound;
 bacchus headlong sought briny flood,
 thetis’ arms received trembling god.
 fail’d crime immortals’ wrath move;
 (the immortals bless’d endless ease above;)
 deprived sight avenging doom,
 cheerless breathed, wander’d gloom,
 sunk unpitied dire abodes,
 wretch accursed, hated gods!
 brave heaven: fruits earth
 sustain thy life, human thy birth,
 bold thou art, prodigal breath,
 approach, enter dark gates death.”
 
“what, whence am, sire,
 (replied chief,) can tydeus’ inquire?
 like leaves trees race man found,
 now green youth, now withering ground;
 another race following spring supplies;
 fall successive, successive rise:
 generations course decay;
 flourish these, pass’d away.
 thou still persist search birth,
 hear tale fills spacious earth.
 
“a city stands argos’ utmost bound,
 (argos fair, warlike steeds renown’d,)
 Æolian sisyphus, wisdom bless’d,
 ancient time happy wall possess’d,
 call’d ephyre: glaucus son;
 great glaucus, father bellerophon,
 o’er sons men beauty shined,
 loved valour preserves mankind.
 mighty praetus argos’ sceptre sway’d,
 whose hard commands bellerophon obey’d.
 direful jealousy monarch raged,
 brave prince numerous toils engaged.
 antaea burn’d lawless flame,
 strove tempt paths fame:
 vain tempted relentless youth,
 endued wisdom, sacred fear, truth.
 fired scorn queen praetus fled,
 begg’d revenge insulted bed:
 incensed heard, resolving fate;
 hospitable laws restrain’d hate:
 lycia devoted youth sent,
 tablets seal’d, told dire intent.[168]
 now bless’d every power guards good,
 chief arrived xanthus’ silver flood:
 lycia’s monarch paid honours due,
 nine days feasted, nine bulls slew.
 tenth bright morning orient glow’d,
 faithful youth monarch’s mandate show’d:
 fatal tablets, till instant seal’d,
 deathful secret king reveal’d.
 first, dire chimaera’s conquest enjoin’d;
 mingled monster mortal kind!
 behind, dragon’s fiery tail spread;
 goat’s rough body bore lion’s head;
 pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire;
 gaping throat emits infernal fire.
 
“this pest slaughter’d, (for read skies,
 trusted heaven’s informing prodigies,)
 met arms solymæan crew,[169]
 (fiercest men,) warrior slew;
 next bold amazons’ whole force defied;
 conquer’d still, heaven side.
 
“nor ended toils: lycian foes,
 return, treacherous ambush rose,
 levell’d spears along winding shore:
 fell breathless, return’d more.
 
“at length monarch, repentant grief,
 confess’d gods, god-descended chief;
 daughter gave, stranger detain,
 half honours ample reign:
 lycians grant chosen space ground,
 woods, vineyards, harvests crown’d.
 long chief happy lot possess’d,
 two brave sons one fair daughter bless’d;
 (fair e’en heavenly eyes: fruitful love
 crown’d sarpedon’s birth embrace jove;)
 last, distracted mind,
 forsook heaven, forsaking humankind,
 wide o’er aleian field chose stray,

 great ajax placed mighty chine.[185]
 now rage hunger removed,
 nestor, persuasive art approved,
 sage whose counsels long sway’d rest,
 words like prudent thought express’d:
 
“how dear, kings! fatal day cost,
 greeks perish’d! people lost!
 tides blood drench’d scamander’s shore!
 crowds heroes sunk rise more!
 hear me, chief! let morrow’s light
 awake thy squadrons new toils fight:
 space least permit war breathe,
 flames slaughter’d friends bequeath,
 red field scatter’d bodies bear,
 nigh fleet funeral structure rear;
 decent urns snowy bones may keep,
 pious children o’er ashes weep.
 here, one promiscuous pile blazed,
 high o’er general tomb raised;
 next, secure camp naval powers,
 raise embattled wall, lofty towers;
 space space ample gates around,
 passing chariots; trench profound.
 greece combat shall safety go,
 fear fierce incursions foe.”
 ’twas thus sage wholesome counsel moved;
 sceptred kings greece words approved.
 
meanwhile, convened priam’s palace-gate,
 trojan peers nightly council sate;
 senate void order, choice:
 hearts fearful, confused voice.
 antenor, rising, thus demands ear:
 “ye trojans, dardans, auxiliars, hear!
 ’tis heaven counsel breast inspires,
 move every god requires:
 let sparta’s treasures hour restored,
 argive helen ancient lord.
 ties faith, sworn alliance, broke,
 impious battles just gods provoke.
 advice ye practise, reject,
 hope success, dread dire effect.”
 
senior spoke sate. replied
 graceful husband spartan bride:
 “cold counsels, trojan, may become thy years
 sound ungrateful warrior’s ears:
 old man, void fallacy art,
 thy words express purpose thy heart,
 thou, thy time, sound advice hast given;
 wisdom date, assign’d heaven.
 hear me, princes trojan name!
 treasures i’ll restore, dame;
 treasures too, peace, will resign;
 bright possession ever mine.”
 
’twas then, growing discord compose,
 slow seat reverend priam rose:
 godlike aspect deep attention drew:
 paused, pacific words ensue:
 
“ye trojans, dardans, auxiliar bands!
 now take refreshment hour demands;
 guard well walls, relieve watch night.
 till new sun restores cheerful light.
 shall herald, atrides sent,
 ships proclaim son’s intent.
 next let truce ask’d, troy may burn
 slaughter’d heroes, bones inurn;
 done, fate war tried,
 whose conquest, mighty jove decide!”
 
monarch spoke: warriors snatch’d haste
 (each post arms) short repast.
 soon rosy morn waked day,
 black ships idæus bent way;
 there, sons mars, council found,
 raised voice: host stood listening round.
 
“ye sons atreus, ye greeks, give ear!
 words troy, troy’s great monarch, hear.
 pleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed prayers)
 paris, author war, declares.
 spoils treasures ilion bore
 (oh perish’d ere touch’d shore!)
 proffers injured greece: large increase
 added trojan wealth buy peace.
 restore beauteous bride again,
 greece demands, troy requests vain.
 next, ye chiefs! ask truce burn
 slaughter’d heroes, bones inurn.
 done, fate war tried,
 whose conquest, mighty jove decide!”
 
greeks gave ear, none silence broke;
 length tydides rose, rising spoke:
 “oh, take not, friends! defrauded fame,
 proffer’d wealth, even spartan dame.
 let conquest make ours: fate shakes wall,
 troy already totters fall.”
 
admiring chiefs, grecian name,
 general shouts return’d loud acclaim.
 thus king kings rejects peace:
 “herald! thou hear’st voice greece
 remains; let funeral flames fed
 heroes’ corps: war dead:
 go search slaughtered chiefs yonder plain,
 gratify manes slain.
 witness, jove, whose thunder rolls high!”
 said, rear’d sceptre sky.
 
sacred troy, princes lay

 straight several cares trojans move,

 less greeks, descending shore,

 sage priam check’d grief: silent haste
 bodies decent piles placed:
 melting hearts cold remains burn’d,
 and, sadly slow, sacred troy return’d.
 less greeks pious sorrows shed,
 decent pile dispose dead;
 cold remains consume equal care;
 slowly, sadly, fleet repair.
 now, ere morn streak’d reddening light
 doubtful confines day night,
 dying flames greeks appear’d,
 round pile general tomb rear’d.
 then, secure camp naval powers,
 raised embattled walls lofty towers:[186]
 space space ample gates around,

 strong piles infix’d stood adverse foe.
 
toil’d greeks: meanwhile gods above,
 shining circle round father jove,
 amazed beheld wondrous works man:
 he, whose trident shakes earth, began:
 
“what mortals henceforth shall power adore,
 fanes frequent, oracles implore,
 proud grecians thus successful boast
 rising bulwarks sea-beat coast?
 see long walls extending main,
 god consulted, victim slain!
 fame shall fill world’s remotest ends,
 wide morn golden beam extends;
 old laomedon’s divine abodes,
 radiant structures raised labouring gods,
 shall, razed lost, long oblivion sleep.”
 thus spoke hoary monarch deep.
 
almighty thunderer frown replies,
 clouds world, blackens half skies:
 “strong god ocean! thou, whose rage can make
 solid earth’s eternal basis shake!
 cause fear mortal works move[187]
 meanest subject realms above?
 where’er sun’s refulgent rays cast,
 thy power honour’d, thy fame shall last.
 yon proud work future age shall view,

 sapp’d foundations thy force shall fall,
 and, whelm’d beneath waves, drop huge wall:
 vast drifts sand shall change former shore:
 ruin vanish’d, name more.”

aurora now, fair daughter dawn,
 sprinkled rosy light dewy lawn;
 jove convened senate skies,
 high olympus’ cloudy tops arise,
 sire gods awful silence broke;
 heavens attentive trembled spoke:[189]
 
“celestial states! immortal gods! give ear,
 hear decree, reverence ye hear;
 fix’d decree heaven can move;
 thou, fate! fulfil it! and, ye powers, approve!
 god enters yon forbidden field,
 yields assistance, wills yield,
 back skies shame shall driven,
 gash’d dishonest wounds, scorn heaven;
 far, oh far, steep olympus thrown,
 low dark tartarean gulf shall groan,
 burning chains fix’d brazen floors,
 lock’d hell’s inexorable doors;
 deep beneath infernal centre hurl’d,[190]
 centre ethereal world.
 let tempts me, dread dire abodes:

 men, gods, compared jove.”
 
all-mighty spoke, durst powers reply:
 reverend horror silenced sky;
 trembling stood sovereign’s look;
 length best-beloved, power wisdom, spoke:
 
“o first greatest! god, gods adored
 thy might, father lord!
 but, ah! permit pity human state:
 help, least lament fate.
 fields forbidden submiss refrain,
 arms unaiding mourn argives slain;
 yet grant counsels still breasts may move,
 must perish wrath jove.”
 
cloud-compelling god suit approved,
 smiled superior best beloved;
 call’d coursers, chariot took;
 stedfast firmament beneath shook:
 rapt ethereal steeds chariot roll’d;
 brass hoofs, curling manes gold:
 heaven’s undrossy gold gods array,
 refulgent, flash’d intolerable day.
 high throne shines: coursers fly
 extended earth starry sky.
 ida’s topmost height came,
 (fair nurse fountains, savage game,)
 o’er pointed summits proudly raised,
 fane breathed odours, altar blazed:
 there, radiant car, sacred sire
 gods men released steeds fire:
 blue ambient mists immortal steeds embraced;
 high cloudy point seat placed;
 thence broad eye subject world surveys,
 town, tents, navigable seas.
 
now grecians snatch’d short repast,
 buckled shining arms haste.
 troy roused soon; dreadful day
 fate fathers, wives, infants lay.
 gates unfolding pour forth train;
 squadrons squadrons cloud dusky plain:
 men, steeds, chariots shake trembling ground,
 tumult thickens, skies resound;
 now shouts shocking armies closed,
 lances lances, shields shields opposed,
 host host shadowy legends drew,
 sounding darts iron tempests flew;
 victors vanquish’d join promiscuous cries,
 triumphant shouts dying groans arise;
 streaming blood slippery fields dyed,
 slaughter’d heroes swell dreadful tide.
 long morning beams, increasing bright,
 o’er heaven’s clear azure spread sacred light,
 commutual death fate war confounds,
 adverse battle gored equal wounds.
 sun height heaven ascends,
 sire gods golden scales suspends,[192]
 equal hand: explored fate
 greece troy, poised mighty weight:
 press’d load, grecian balance lies
 low sunk earth, trojan strikes skies.
 jove ida’s top horrors spreads;
 clouds burst dreadful o’er grecian heads;
 thick lightnings flash; muttering thunder rolls;
 strength withers, unmans souls.
 wrath trembling hosts retire;
 gods terrors, skies fire.
 great idomeneus sight bear,
 stern ajax, thunderbolts war:
 he, king war, alarm sustain’d
 nestor alone, amidst storm remain’d.
 unwilling remain’d, paris’ dart
 pierced courser mortal part;
 fix’d forehead, springing mane
 curl’d o’er brow, stung brain;
 mad anguish, begins rear,
 paw hoofs aloft, lash air.
 scarce falchion cut reins, freed
 encumber’d chariot dying steed,
 dreadful hector, thundering war,
 pour’d tumult whirling car.
 day stretch’d beneath matchless hand
 hoary monarch pylian band,
 diomed beheld; forth crowd
 rush’d, ulysses call’d aloud:
 
“whither, oh whither ulysses run?
 oh, flight unworthy great laertes’ son!
 mix’d vulgar shall thy fate found,
 pierced back, vile, dishonest wound?
 oh turn save hector’s direful rage
 glory greeks, pylian sage.”
 fruitless words lost unheard air,
 ulysses seeks ships, shelters there.
 bold tydides rescue goes,
 single warrior midst host foes;
 coursers sudden spring
 leap’d, anxious thus bespoke king:
 
“great perils, father! wait unequal fight;
 younger champions will oppress thy might.
 thy veins ancient vigour glow,
 weak thy servant, thy coursers slow.
 haste, ascend seat, car
 observe steeds tros, renown’d war.
 practised alike turn, stop, chase,
 dare fight, urge rapid race:
 late obey’d Æneas’ guiding rein;
 leave thou thy chariot faithful train;
 yon trojans will go,
 shall great hector want equal foe;
 fierce is, even may learn fear
 thirsty fury flying spear.”
 
thus said chief; nestor, skill’d war,
 approves counsel, ascends car:
 steeds left, trusty servants hold;
 eurymedon, sthenelus bold:
 reverend charioteer directs course,
 strains aged arm lash horse.
 hector face; unknowing fear,
 fierce drove on; tydides whirl’d spear.
 spear erring haste mistook way,
 plunged eniopeus’ bosom lay.
 opening hand death forsakes rein;
 steeds fly back: falls, spurns plain.
 great hector sorrows servant kill’d,
 yet unrevenged permits press field;
 till, supply place rule car,
 rose archeptolemus, fierce war.
 now death horror cover’d all;[193]
 like timorous flocks trojans wall
 inclosed bled: jove awful sound
 roll’d big thunder o’er vast profound:
 full tydides’ face lightning flew;
 ground flamed sulphur blue;
 quivering steeds fell prostrate sight;
 nestor’s trembling hand confess’d fright:
 dropp’d reins: and, shook sacred dread,
 thus, turning, warn’d intrepid diomed:
 
“o chief! daring thy friend’s defence
 retire advised, urge chariot hence.
 day, averse, sovereign skies
 assists great hector, palm denies.
 sun may see happier hour,
 greece shall conquer heavenly power.
 ’tis man fix’d decree move:
 great will glory submit jove.”
 
“o reverend prince! (tydides thus replies)
 thy years awful, thy words wise.
 ah, grief! haughty hector boast
 fled inglorious guarded coast.
 dire disgrace shall blast fame,
 o’erwhelm me, earth; hide warrior’s shame!”
 gerenian nestor thus replied:[194]
 “gods! can thy courage fear phrygian’s pride?
 hector may vaunt, shall heed boast?
 felt thy arm, dardan host,
 troy, yet bleeding heroes lost;
 even phrygian dame, dreads sword
 laid dust loved, lamented lord.”
 said, and, hasty, o’er gasping throng
 drives swift steeds: chariot smokes along;
 shouts trojans thicken wind;
 storm hissing javelins pours behind.
 voice shakes solid skies,
 pleased, hector braves warrior flies.
 “go, mighty hero! graced rest
 seats council sumptuous feast:
 now hope honours thy train;
 go less woman, form man!
 scale walls, wrap towers flames,
 lead exile fair phrygian dames,
 thy proud hopes, presumptuous prince! fled;
 arm shall reach thy heart, stretch thee dead.”
 
now fears dissuade him, now hopes invite.
 stop coursers, stand fight;
 thrice turn’d chief, thrice imperial jove
 ida’s summits thunder’d above.
 great hector heard; saw flashing light,
 (the sign conquest,) thus urged fight:
 
“hear, every trojan, lycian, dardan band,
 famed war, dreadful hand hand.
 mindful wreaths arms won,
 great forefathers’ glories, own.
 heard ye voice jove? success fame
 await troy, greece eternal shame.
 vain skulk behind boasted wall,
 weak bulwarks; destined arm fall.
 high o’er slighted trench steeds shall bound,
 pass victorious o’er levell’d mound.
 soon yon hollow ships stand,
 fight flames, toss blazing brand;
 till, proud navy wrapt smoke fires,
 greece, encompass’d, one blaze expires.”
 
furious said; bending o’er yoke,
 encouraged proud steeds, thus spoke:
 
“now, xanthus, Æthon, lampus, urge chase,
 thou, podargus! prove thy generous race;
 fleet, fearless, important day,
 master’s well-spent care repay.
 this, high-fed, plenteous stalls ye stand,
 served pure wheat, princess’ hand;
 spouse, great aëtion’s line,
 oft steep’d strengthening grain wine.
 now swift pursue, now thunder uncontroll’d:
 give seize rich nestor’s shield gold;
 tydeus’ shoulders strip costly load,
 vulcanian arms, labour god:
 gain, victory, ye powers!
 night, glorious night, fleet ours!”
 
heard, deep anguish stung saturnia’s soul;
 shook throne, shook starry pole:
 thus neptune: “thou, whose force can make
 stedfast earth foundations shake,
 seest thou greeks fates unjust oppress’d,
 swells thy heart immortal breast?
 yet Ægae, helicè, thy power obey,[195]
 gifts unceasing thine altars lay.
 deities greece combine,
 vain gloomy thunderer might repine:
 sole sit, scarce god friend,
 see trojans shades descend:
 scene idaean bower;
 ungrateful prospect sullen power!”
 
neptune wrath rejects rash design:
 “what rage, madness, furious queen! thine?
 war highest. above
 submit tremble hand jove.”
 
now godlike hector, whose matchless might
 jove gave glory destined fight,
 squadrons squadrons drives, fills fields
 close-ranged chariots, thicken’d shields.
 deep trench length extended lay,
 compacted troops stand wedged firm array,
 dreadful front! shake brands, threat
 long-destroying flames hostile fleet.
 king men, juno’s self inspired,
 toil’d tents, army fired.
 swift moved, lifted hand
 purple robe, bright ensign command.
 high midmost bark king appear’d:
 there, ulysses’ deck, voice heard:
 ajax achilles reach’d sound,
 whose distant ships guarded navy bound.
 “o argives! shame human race! (he cried:
 hollow vessels voice replied,)
 now glorious boasts yore,
 hasty triumphs lemnian shore?
 fearless hero dares hundred foes,
 feast lasts, goblet flows;
 meet one martial man found,
 fight rages, flames surround?
 mighty jove! sire distress’d!
 ever king like me, like oppress’d?
 power immense, justice arm’d vain;
 glory ravish’d, people slain!
 thee vows breathed every shore;
 altar smoked victims’ gore?
 fat bulls fed constant flame,
 ask’d destruction trojan name.
 now, gracious god! far humbler demand;
 give least ’scape hector’s hand,
 save relics grecian land!”
 
thus pray’d king, heaven’s great father heard
 vows, bitterness soul preferr’d:
 wrath appeased, happy signs declares,
 gives people monarch’s prayers.
 eagle, sacred bird heaven! sent,
 fawn talons truss’d, (divine portent!)
 high o’er wondering hosts soar’d above,
 paid vows panomphaean jove;
 let prey altar fall;
 greeks beheld, transport seized all:
 encouraged sign, troops revive,
 fierce troy doubled fury drive.
 tydides first, grecian force,
 o’er broad ditch impell’d foaming horse,
 pierced deep ranks, strongest battle tore,
 dyed javelin red trojan gore.
 young agelaus (phradmon sire)
 flying coursers shunn’d dreadful ire;
 struck back, phrygian fell oppress’d;
 dart drove on, issued breast:
 headlong quits car: arms resound;
 ponderous buckler thunders ground.
 forth rush tide greeks, passage freed;
 atridae first, ajaces next succeed:
 meriones, like mars arms renown’d,
 godlike idomen, now passed mound;
 evaemon’s next issues foe,
 last young teucer bended bow.
 secure behind telamonian shield
 skilful archer wide survey’d field,
 every shaft hostile victim slew,
 close beneath sevenfold orb withdrew:
 conscious infant so, fear alarms,
 retires safety mother’s arms.
 thus ajax guards brother field,
 moves moves, turns shining shield.
 first teucer’s mortal arrows bled?
 orsilochus; fell ormenus dead:
 godlike lycophon next press’d plain,
 chromius, daetor, ophelestes slain:
 bold hamopaon breathless sunk ground;
 bloody pile great melanippus crown’d.
 heaps fell heaps, sad trophies art,
 trojan ghost attending every dart.
 great agamemnon views joyful eye
 ranks grow thinner arrows fly:
 “o youth forever dear! (the monarch cried)
 thus, always thus, thy early worth tried;
 thy brave example shall retrieve host,
 thy country’s saviour, thy father’s boast!
 sprung alien’s bed thy sire grace,
 vigorous offspring stolen embrace:
 proud boy, own’d generous flame,
 brave repays cares fame.
 now hear monarch’s vow: heaven’s high powers
 give raze troy’s long-defended towers;
 whatever treasures greece design,
 next rich honorary gift thine:
 golden tripod, distinguished car,
 coursers dreadful ranks war:
 fair captive, thy eyes approve,
 shall recompense warrior’s toils love.”
 
chief: “with praise rest inspire,
 urge soul already fill’d fire.
 strength have, now battle tried,
 till every shaft phrygian blood dyed.
 since rallying wall forced foe,
 still aim’d hector bent bow:
 eight forky arrows hand fled,
 eight bold heroes points lie dead:
 sure god denies destroy
 fury field, dog troy.”
 
said, twang’d string. weapon flies
 hector’s breast, sings along skies:
 miss’d mark; pierced gorgythio’s heart,
 drench’d royal blood thirsty dart.
 (fair castianira, nymph form divine,
 offspring added king priam’s line.)
 full-blown poppies, overcharged rain,[196]
 decline head, drooping kiss plain;
 sinks youth: beauteous head, depress’d
 beneath helmet, drops upon breast.
 another shaft raging archer drew,
 shaft erring fury flew,
 (from hector, phœbus turn’d flying wound,)
 yet fell dry guiltless ground:
 thy breast, brave archeptolemus! tore,
 dipp’d feathers vulgar gore.
 headlong falls: sudden fall alarms
 steeds, startle sounding arms.
 hector grief charioteer beheld
 pale breathless sanguine field:
 bids cebriones direct rein,
 quits bright car, issues plain.
 dreadful shouts: earth stone took,
 rush’d teucer lifted rock.
 youth already strain’d forceful yew;
 shaft already shoulder drew;
 feather hand, just wing’d flight,
 touch’d neck hollow chest unite;
 there, juncture knits channel bone,
 furious chief discharged craggy stone:
 bow-string burst beneath ponderous blow,
 numb’d hand dismiss’d useless bow.
 fell: ajax broad shield display’d,
 screen’d brother mighty shade;
 till great alaster, mecistheus, bore
 batter’d archer groaning shore.
 
troy yet found grace olympian sire,
 arm’d hands, fill’d breasts fire.
 greeks repulsed, retreat behind wall,
 trench heaps confusedly fall.
 first foe, great hector march’d along,
 terror clothed, mortal strong.
 bold hound, gives lion chase,
 beating bosom, eager pace,
 hangs haunch, fastens heels,
 guards turns, circles wheels;
 thus oft grecians turn’d, still flew;
 thus following, hector still hindmost slew.
 flying pass’d trench profound,
 many chief lay gasping ground;
 ships desperate stand made,
 fired troops, called gods aid.
 fierce rattling chariot hector came:
 eyes like gorgon shot sanguine flame
 wither’d host: like mars stood:
 dire monster, dreadful god!
 strong distress wife jove survey’d;
 pensive thus, war’s triumphant maid:
 
“o daughter god, whose arm can wield

 now, moment last despair,

 condemn’d suffer full force fate,
 drain dregs heaven’s relentless hate?
 gods! shall one raging hand thus level all?
 numbers fell! numbers yet shall fall!
 power divine shall hector’s wrath assuage?
 still swells slaughter, still grows rage!”
 
spake imperial regent skies;
 goddess azure eyes:
 
“long since hector stain’d fields gore,

“what frenzy goddesses! rage can move

juno pallas grieving hear doom,
 feast souls ilion’s woes come.
 though secret anger swell’d minerva’s breast,
 prudent goddess yet wrath repress’d;

 ’tis thine punish; grieve alone.

 conquering trojans mourn beams decay’d;

“ye valiant trojans, attention hear!

embassy achilles.
 

agamemnon, last day’s defeat, proposes greeks quit
 siege, return country. diomed opposes this, nestor
 seconds him, praising wisdom resolution. orders guard to

 followed emergency. agamemnon pursues advice, and
 nestor prevails upon send ambassadors achilles, in
 order move reconciliation. ulysses ajax made choice
 of, accompanied old phœnix. make, them, very
 moving pressing speeches, rejected roughness by
 achilles, notwithstanding retains phœnix tent. the
 ambassadors return unsuccessfully camp, troops betake
 sleep.
 book, next following, take space one night,
 twenty-seventh beginning poem. the
 scene lies sea-shore, station grecian ships.
 

thus joyful troy maintain’d watch night;
 fear, pale comrade inglorious flight,[199]
 heaven-bred horror, grecian part,
 sat face, sadden’d every heart.
 cloudy dungeon issuing forth,
 double tempest west north
 swells o’er sea, thracia’s frozen shore,
 heaps waves waves, bids Ægean roar:
 way boiling deeps toss’d:
 various passions urged troubled host,
 great agamemnon grieved rest;
 superior sorrows swell’d royal breast;
 orders heralds bears,
 bid council grecian peers,
 bid whispers: surround chief,
 solemn sadness majestic grief.
 king amidst mournful circle rose:
 wan cheek briny torrent flows.
 silent fountains, rock’s tall head,
 sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.
 vulgar grief stood oppress’d;
 words, mix’d sighs, thus bursting breast:
 
“ye sons greece! partake leader’s care;
 fellows arms princes war!
 partial jove justly complain,
 heavenly oracles believed vain.
 safe return promised toils,
 conquest honour’d enrich’d spoils:
 now shameful flight alone can save host;
 wealth, people, glory lost.
 jove decrees, almighty lord all!
 jove, whose nod whole empires rise fall,
 shakes feeble props human trust,
 towers armies humbles dust.
 haste then, ever quit fatal fields,
 haste joys native country yields;
 spread canvas, oars employ,
 hope fall heaven-defended troy.”
 
said: deep silence held grecian band;
 silent, unmov’d dire dismay stand;
 pensive scene! till tydeus’ warlike son
 roll’d king eyes, thus begun:
 “when kings advise us renounce fame,
 first let speak first suffer’d shame.
 oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,
 laws council bid tongue bold.
 thou first, thou alone, fields fight,
 durst brand courage, defame might:
 friend unkind reproach appear’d,
 greeks stood witness, army heard.
 gods, chief! honours spring,
 gods made thee halves king:
 gave thee sceptres, wide command;
 gave dominion o’er seas land;
 noblest power might world control
 gave thee not—a brave virtuous soul.
 general’s voice, suggest
 fears like every grecian breast?
 confiding want worth, stands;
 fly, ’tis king commands.
 go thou, inglorious! embattled plain;
 ships thou hast store, nearest main;
 noble care grecians shall employ,
 combat, conquer, extirpate troy.
 greece shall stay; or, greece retire,
 shall stay, till troy expire;
 myself, sthenelus, will fight fame;
 god bade us fight, ’twas god came.”
 
ceased; greeks loud acclamations raise,
 voice voice resounds tydides’ praise.
 wise nestor reverend figure rear’d;
 spoke: host still attention heard:[200]
 
“o truly great! gods join’d
 strength body force mind:
 conduct, courage, excel,
 still first act advise well.
 wholesome counsels thy wisdom moves,
 applauding greece common voice approves.
 kings thou canst blame; bold prudent youth:
 blame even kings praise, truth.
 yet years since thy birth run
 hardly style thee nestor’s youngest son.
 let add yet remains behind,
 thought unfinish’d generous mind;
 age bids speak! shall advice bring
 distaste people, offend king:
 
“cursed man, void law right,
 unworthy property, unworthy light,
 unfit public rule, private care,
 wretch, monster, delights war;
 whose lust murder, whose horrid joy,
 tear country, kind destroy!
 night, refresh fortify thy train;
 trench wall let guards remain:
 duty young bold;
 thou, king, council call old;
 great thy sway, weighty thy cares;
 thy high commands must spirit wars.
 thracian wines recruit thy honour’d guests,
 happy counsels flow sober feasts.
 wise, weighty counsels aid state distress’d,
 monarch can choose best.
 see blaze hostile tents aspires,
 near fleet approach trojan fires!
 can, unmoved, behold dreadful light?
 eye beholds them, can close to-night?
 dreadful interval determines all;
 to-morrow, troy must flame, greece must fall.”
 
thus spoke hoary sage: rest obey;
 swift gates guards direct way.

 seven leaders nightly bands,
 bold chief hundred spears commands.
 fires light, short repasts fall,
 line trench, others man wall.
 
king men, public counsels bent,
 convened princes ample tent,
 seized portion kingly feast,
 stay’d hand thirst hunger ceased.
 nestor spoke, wisdom long approved,
 slowly rising, thus council moved.
 
“monarch nations! whose superior sway
 assembled states, lords earth obey,
 laws sceptres thy hand given,
 millions care thee heaven.
 king! counsels age attend;
 thee cares begin, thee must end.

 heaps brazen vase three chines entire:
 brazen vase automedon sustains,

 achilles genial feast presides,

 meanwhile patroclus sweats, fire raise;

 (for rage invades wisest best).
 
“cursed althaea, wrath yields,
 wife’s embrace forgets fields.
 (she marpessa sprung, divinely fair,
 matchless idas, man war:
 god day adored mother’s charms;
 god father bent arms:
 afflicted pair, sorrows proclaim,
 cleopatra changed daughter’s name,
 call’d alcyone; name show
 father’s grief, mourning mother’s woe.)
 chief retired stern debate,
 found peace fierce althaea’s hate:
 althaea’s hate unhappy warrior drew,
 whose luckless hand royal uncle slew;
 beat ground, call’d powers beneath
 wreak brother’s death;
 hell heard curses realms profound,
 red fiends walk nightly round.
 vain Ætolia deliverer waits,
 war shakes walls, thunders gates.
 sent ambassadors, chosen band,
 priests gods, elders land;
 besought chief save sinking state:
 prayers urgent, proffers great:
 (full fifty acres richest ground,
 half pasture green, half vineyards crown’d:)
 suppliant father, aged Œneus, came;
 sisters follow’d; even vengeful dame,
 althaea, sues; friends fall:
 stands relentless, rejects all.
 meanwhile victor’s shouts ascend skies;
 walls scaled; rolling flames arise;
 length wife (a form divine) appears,
 piercing cries, supplicating tears;
 paints horrors conquer’d town,
 heroes slain, palaces o’erthrown,
 matrons ravish’d, whole race enslaved:
 warrior heard, vanquish’d, saved.
 Ætolians, long disdain’d, now took turn,
 left chief broken faith mourn.
 learn hence, betimes curb pernicious ire,
 stay till yonder fleets ascend fire;
 accept presents; draw thy conquering sword;
 amongst guardian gods adored.”
 
thus he: stern achilles thus replied:
 “my second father, reverend guide:
 thy friend, believe me, gifts demands,
 asks honours mortal’s hands;
 jove honours me, favours designs;
 pleasure guides me, will confines;
 stay (if high behest)
 life’s warm spirit beats within breast.
 yet hear one word, lodge thy heart:
 molest atrides’ part:
 tears taught flow,
 sorrows? mortal foe?
 generous friendship cold medium knows,
 burns one love, one resentment glows;
 one interests passions be;
 friend must hate man injures me.
 this, phœnix, ’tis generous part;
 share realms, honours, heart.
 let return: voyage, stay,
 rest undetermined till dawning day.”
 
ceased; order’d sage’s bed
 warmer couch numerous carpets spread.
 that, stern ajax long silence broke,
 thus, impatient, ulysses spoke:
 
“hence let us go—why waste time vain?
 see effect low submissions gain!
 liked liked, words must relate,
 greeks expect them, heroes wait.
 proud is, iron heart retains
 stubborn purpose, friends disdains.
 stern unpitying! brother bleed,
 just atonement, remit deed;
 sire slaughter forgives;
 price blood discharged, murderer lives:
 haughtiest hearts length rage resign,
 gifts can conquer every soul thine.[213]
 gods unrelenting breast steel’d,
 cursed thee mind yield.
 one woman-slave ravish’d thy arms:
 lo, seven offer’d, equal charms.
 hear, achilles! better mind;
 revere thy roof, thy guests kind;
 know men grecian host,
 honour worth, prize thy valour most.”
 
“o soul battles, thy people’s guide!
 (to ajax thus first greeks replied)
 well hast thou spoke; tyrant’s name
 rage rekindles, soul’s flame:
 ’tis just resentment, becomes brave:
 disgraced, dishonour’d, like vilest slave!
 return, then, heroes! answer bear,
 glorious combat care;
 till, amidst yon sinking navy slain,
 blood greeks shall dye sable main;
 till flames, hector’s fury thrown,
 consume vessels, approach own;
 just there, impetuous homicide shall stand,
 cease battle, feel hand.”
 
said, prince double goblet crown’d,
 cast large libation ground;
 vessels, gloomy shades,
 chiefs return; divine ulysses leads.
 meantime achilles’ slaves prepared bed,
 fleeces, carpets, soft linen spread:
 there, till sacred morn restored day,
 slumber sweet reverend phœnix lay.
 inner tent, ampler space,
 achilles slept; warm embrace
 fair diomede lesbian race.
 last, patroclus couch prepared,
 whose nightly joys beauteous iphis shared;
 achilles friend consign’d charms
 scyros fell conquering arms.
 
now elected chiefs greece sent,
 pass’d hosts, reach’d royal tent.
 rising all, goblets hands,
 peers leaders achaian bands
 hail’d return: atrides first begun:
 
“say success? divine laertes’ son!
 achilles’ high resolves declare all:
 returns chief, must navy fall?”
 
“great king nations! (ithacus replied)
 fix’d wrath, unconquer’d pride;
 slights thy friendship, thy proposals scorns,
 and, thus implored, fiercer fury burns.
 save army, fleets free,
 care; left greece thee.
 eyes shall view, morning paints sky,
 beneath oars whitening billows fly;
 us bids oars sails employ,
 hope fall heaven-protected troy;
 jove o’ershades arm divine,
 inspires war, bids glory shine.
 word: declared,
 sacred heralds great ajax heard.
 phœnix tent chief retains,
 safe transport native plains
 morning dawns; decree,
 age sacred, choice free.”
 
ulysses ceased: great achaian host,
 sorrow seized, consternation lost,
 attend stern reply. tydides broke
 general silence, undaunted spoke.
 “why gifts proud achilles send,
 strive prayers haughty soul bend?
 country’s woes glories deride,
 prayers will burst swelling heart pride.
 fierce impulse rage obey’d,
 battles let desert aid;
 let arm jove think fit:
 that, madness, heaven commit:
 can, always ours;
 night, let due repast refresh powers;
 (for strength consists spirits blood,
 owed generous wine food;)
 rosy messenger day
 strikes blue mountains golden ray,
 ranged ships, let squadrons shine
 flaming arms, long-extended line:
 dread front let great atrides stand,
 first danger, high command.”
 
shouts acclaim listening heroes raise,
 heaven due libations pays;
 till sleep, descending o’er tents, bestows
 grateful blessings desired repose.[214]

 night continues; scene lies two camps.
 

night chiefs vessels lay,
 lost sleep labours day:
 king: various thoughts oppress’d,[215]
 country’s cares lay rolling breast.
 lightnings jove’s ethereal power
 foretels rattling hail, weighty shower,
 sends soft snows whiten shore,
 bids brazen throat war roar;
 fits one flash succeeds one expires,
 heaven flames thick momentary fires:
 bursting frequent atrides’ breast,
 sighs following sighs inward fears confess’d.

 thousand trojan fires mounting blaze;
 hears passing wind music blow,
 marks distinct voices foe.
 now looking backwards fleet coast,
 anxious sorrows endangered host.
 rends hair, sacrifice jove,

thousand cares labouring breast revolves;
 seek sage nestor now chief resolves,
 him, wholesome counsels, debate
 yet remains save afflicted state.
 rose, first cast mantle round,
 next feet shining sandals bound;
 lion’s yellow spoils back conceal’d;
 warlike hand pointed javelin held.
 meanwhile brother, press’d equal woes,
 alike denied gifts soft repose,
 laments greece, cause before
 much suffer’d must suffer more.
 leopard’s spotted hide shoulders spread:
 brazen helmet glitter’d head:
 thus (with javelin hand) went

 already waked, atrides descried,
 armour buckling vessel’s side.
 joyful met; spartan thus begun:
 “why puts brother bright armour on?
 sends spy, amidst silent hours,
 try yon camp, watch trojan powers?
 say, hero shall sustain task?
 bold exploits uncommon courage ask;
 guideless, alone, night’s dark shade go,
 midst hostile camp explore foe.”
 
king: “in distress stand,
 vulgar counsel affairs demand;
 greece preserve, now easy part,
 asks high wisdom, deep design, art.
 jove, averse, humble prayer denies,
 bows head hector’s sacrifice.
 eye witness’d, ear believed,
 one great day, one great arm achieved,
 wondrous deeds hector’s hand done,
 beheld, last revolving sun?
 honours beloved jove adorn!
 sprung god, goddess born;
 yet acts, greeks unborn shall tell,
 curse battle fathers fell.
 
“now speed thy hasty course along fleet,
 call great ajax, prince crete;
 ourself hoary nestor will repair;
 keep guards duty care,
 (for nestor’s influence best quarter guides,
 whose merion, o’er watch presides.”)
 spartan: “these thy orders borne,
 say, shall stay, despatch return?”
 “there shall thou stay, (the king men replied,)
 else may miss meet, without guide,
 paths many, camp wide.
 still, voice slothful soldiers raise,
 urge fathers’ fame future praise.
 forget now state lofty birth;
 titles here, works, must prove worth.
 labour lot man below;
 jove gave us life, gave us woe.”
 
said, parted several cares:
 king nestor’s sable ship repairs;
 sage protector greeks found
 stretch’d bed arms around;
 various-colour’d scarf, shield rears,
 shining helmet, pointed spears;
 dreadful weapons warrior’s rage,
 that, old arms, disdain’d peace age.
 then, leaning hand watchful head,
 hoary monarch raised eyes said:
 
“what art thou, speak, designs unknown,
 others sleep, thus range camp alone;
 seek’st thou friend nightly sentinel?
 stand off, approach not, thy purpose tell.”
 
“o neleus, (thus king rejoin’d,)
 pride greeks, glory thy kind!
 lo, wretched agamemnon stands,
 unhappy general grecian bands,
 jove decrees daily cares bend,
 woes, life shall end!
 scarce can knees trembling limbs sustain,
 scarce heart support load pain.
 taste sleep heavy eyes known,
 confused, sad, wander thus alone,
 fears distracted, fix’d design;
 people’s miseries mine.
 aught use thy waking thoughts suggest,
 (since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul rest,)
 impart thy counsel, assist thy friend;
 now let us jointly trench descend,
 every gate fainting guard excite,
 tired toils day watch night;
 else may sudden foe works invade,
 near, favour’d gloomy shade.”
 
thus nestor: “trust powers above,
 think proud hector’s hopes confirm’d jove:
 ill agree views vain mankind,
 wise counsels eternal mind!
 audacious hector, gods ordain
 great achilles rise rage again,
 toils attend thee, woes remain!
 lo, faithful nestor thy command obeys;
 care next chiefs raise:
 ulysses, diomed, chiefly need;
 meges strength, oïleus famed speed.
 despatch’d nimbler feet,
 tall ships, remotest fleet,
 lie great ajax king crete.[216]
 rouse spartan decree;
 dear us, dear thee,
 yet must tax sloth, claims share
 great brother martial care:
 behoved every chief sue,
 preventing every part perform’d you;
 strong necessity toils demands,
 claims hearts, urges hands.”
 
king: “with reverence allow
 thy just rebukes, yet learn spare now:
 generous brother gentle kind,
 seems remiss, bears valiant mind;
 much deference sovereign sway,
 content follow lead way:
 now, ills industrious prevent,
 long ere rest rose, sought tent.
 chiefs named, already call,
 prepare meet us near navy-wall;
 assembling there, trench gates,
 near night-guards, chosen council waits.”
 
“then none (said nestor) shall rule withstand,
 great examples justify command.”
 that, venerable warrior rose;
 shining greaves manly legs enclose;
 purple mantle golden buckles join’d,
 warm softest wool, doubly lined.
 rushing tent, snatch’d haste
 steely lance, lighten’d pass’d.
 camp traversed sleeping crowd,
 stopp’d ulysses’ tent, call’d aloud.
 ulysses, sudden voice sent,
 awakes, starts up, issues tent.
 “what new distress, sudden cause fright,
 thus leads wandering silent night?”
 “o prudent chief! (the pylian sage replied)
 wise thou art, now thy wisdom tried:
 whatever means safety can sought,
 whatever counsels can inspire thought,
 whatever methods, fly fight;
 all, depend important night!”
 heard, return’d, took painted shield;
 join’d chiefs, follow’d field.
 without tent, bold diomed found,
 sheathed arms, brave companions round:
 sunk sleep, extended field,
 head reclining bossy shield.
 wood spears stood by, that, fix’d upright,
 shot flashing points quivering light.
 bull’s black hide composed hero’s bed;
 splendid carpet roll’d beneath head.
 then, foot, old nestor gently shakes
 slumbering chief, words awakes:
 
“rise, tydeus! brave strong
 rest seems inglorious, night long.
 sleep’st thou now, yon hill foe
 hangs o’er fleet, shades walls below?”
 
this, soft slumber eyelids fled;
 warrior saw hoary chief, said:
 “wondrous old man! whose soul respite knows,
 though years honours bid thee seek repose,
 let younger greeks sleeping warriors wake;
 ill fits thy age toils undertake.”
 “my friend, (he answered,) generous thy care;
 toils, subjects sons might bear;
 loyal thoughts pious love conspire
 ease sovereign relieve sire:
 now last despair surrounds host;
 hour must pass, moment must lost;
 single greek, conclusive strife,
 stands sharpest edge death life:
 yet, years thy kind regard engage,
 employ thy youth employ age;
 succeed cares, rouse rest;
 serves most, serves country best.”
 
said, hero o’er shoulders flung
 lion’s spoils, ankles hung;
 seized ponderous lance, strode along.
 meges bold, ajax famed speed,
 warrior roused, entrenchments lead.
 
now chiefs approach nightly guard;
 wakeful squadron, arms prepared:
 unwearied watch listening leaders keep,
 and, couching close, repel invading sleep.
 faithful dogs fleecy charge maintain,
 toil protected prowling train;
 gaunt lioness, hunger bold,
 springs mountains toward guarded fold:
 breaking woods rustling course hear;
 loud, loud, clamours strike ear
 hounds men: start, gaze around,
 watch every side, turn every sound.
 thus watch’d grecians, cautious surprise,
 voice, motion, drew ears eyes:
 step passing feet increased affright;
 hostile troy ever full sight.
 nestor joy wakeful band survey’d,
 thus accosted gloomy shade.
 “’tis well, sons! nightly cares employ;
 else must host become scorn troy.
 watch thus, greece shall live.” hero said;
 o’er trench following chieftains led.
 son, godlike merion, march’d behind
 (for princes council join’d).
 trenches pass’d, assembled kings around
 silent state consistory crown’d.
 place was, yet undefiled gore,
 spot hector stopp’d rage before;
 night descending, vengeful hand
 reprieved relics grecian band:
 (the plain beside mangled corps spread,
 progress mark’d heaps dead:)
 sat mournful kings: neleus’ son,
 council opening, words begun:
 
“is (said he) chief greatly brave,
 life hazard, country save?
 lives man, singly dares go
 yonder camp, seize straggling foe?
 favour’d night approach near,
 speech, counsels, designs hear?
 besiege navies prepare,
 troy must seat war?
 learn, peers recite,
 pass unharm’d dangers night;
 fame succeeding days,
 phœbus shines, men tongues praise!
 gifts grateful country bestow!
 must greece deliverer owe?
 sable ewe leader provide,
 sable lambkin side;
 every rite share increased,
 foremost honours feast.”
 
fear held mute: alone, untaught fear,
 tydides spoke—“the man seek here.
 yon black camps bend dangerous way,
 god within commands, obey.
 let chosen warrior join,
 raise hopes, second design.
 mutual confidence mutual aid,
 great deeds done, great discoveries made;
 wise new prudence wise acquire,
 one brave hero fans another’s fire.”
 
contending leaders word arose;
 generous breast emulation glows;
 brave task ajax strove share,
 bold merion strove, nestor’s valiant heir;
 spartan wish’d second place gain,
 great ulysses wish’d, wish’d vain.
 thus king men contest ends:
 “thou first warriors, thou best friends,
 undaunted diomed! chief join
 great enterprise, thine.
 just thy choice, without affection made;
 birth, office, respect paid;
 let worth determine here.” monarch spake,
 inly trembled brother’s sake.
 
“then thus (the godlike diomed rejoin’d)
 choice declares impulse mind.
 can doubt, great ulysses stands
 lend counsels assist hands?
 chief, whose safety minerva’s care;
 famed, dreadful, works war:
 bless’d conduct, aid require;
 wisdom like might pass flames fire.”
 
“it fits thee not, chiefs fame,
 (replied sage,) praise me, blame:
 praise friend, censure foe,
 lost hearers merits know.
 let us haste—night rolls hours away,
 reddening orient shows coming day,
 stars shine fainter ethereal plains,
 night’s empire third remains.”
 
thus spoke, generous ardour press’d,
 arms terrific huge limbs dress’d.
 two-edged falchion thrasymed brave,
 ample buckler, tydides gave:
 leathern helm cased head,
 short crest, plume o’erspread:
 (such youths unused arms worn:)
 spoils enrich it, studs adorn.
 next ulysses took shining sword,
 bow quiver, bright arrows stored:
 well-proved casque, leather braces bound,
 (thy gift, meriones,) temples crown’d;
 soft wool within; without, order spread,[217]
 boar’s white teeth grinn’d horrid o’er head.
 amyntor, rich ormenus’ son,
 autolycus fraudful rapine won,
 gave amphidamas; prize
 molus received, pledge social ties;
 helmet next merion possess’d,
 now ulysses’ thoughtful temples press’d.
 thus sheathed arms, council forsake,
 dark paths oblique progress take.
 just then, sign favour’d intent,
 long-wing’d heron great minerva sent:
 this, though surrounding shades obscured view,
 shrill clang whistling wings knew.
 right soar’d, ulysses pray’d,
 hail’d glad omen, address’d maid:
 
“o daughter god whose arm can wield
 avenging bolt, shake saber shield!
 thou! ever present way,
 motions, toils survey!
 safe may pass beneath gloomy shade,
 safe thy succour ships convey’d,
 let deed signal night adorn,
 claim tears trojans yet unborn.”
 
godlike diomed preferr’d prayer:
 “daughter jove, unconquer’d pallas! hear.
 great queen arms, whose favour tydeus won,
 thou defend’st sire, defend son.
 Æsopus’ banks banded powers
 greece left, sought theban towers,
 peace charge; received peaceful show,
 went legate, return’d foe:
 help’d thee, cover’d thy shield,
 fought numbers, made numbers yield.
 now present, celestial maid!
 still continue race thine aid!
 youthful steer shall fall beneath stroke,
 untamed, unconscious galling yoke,
 ample forehead, spreading horns,
 whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns.”
 heroes pray’d, pallas skies
 accords vow, succeeds enterprise.
 now, like two lions panting prey,
 dreadful thoughts trace dreary way,
 black horrors ensanguined plain,
 dust, blood, o’er arms, hills slain.
 
less bold hector, sons troy,
 high designs wakeful hours employ;
 assembled peers lofty chief enclosed;
 thus counsels breast proposed:
 
“what glorious man, high attempts prepared,
 dares greatly venture rich reward?
 yonder fleet bold discovery make,
 watch keep, resolves take?
 now subdued meditate flight,
 and, spent toil, neglect watch night?
 chariot shall please most,
 plunder vanquish’d host;
 fair steeds rest excel,
 glory served well.”
 
youth among tribes troy,
 dolon name, eumedes’ boy,
 (five girls beside reverend herald told.)
 rich brass, rich gold;
 bless’d nature charms face,
 swift foot, matchless race.
 “hector! (he said) courage bids meet
 high achievement, explore fleet:
 first exalt thy sceptre skies,
 swear grant demanded prize;
 immortal coursers, glittering car,
 bear pelides ranks war.
 encouraged thus, idle scout go,
 fulfil thy wish, whole intention know,
 even royal tent pursue way,
 counsels, aims betray.”
 
chief heaved golden sceptre high,
 attesting thus monarch sky:
 “be witness thou! immortal lord all!
 whose thunder shakes dark aerial hall:
 none dolon shall prize borne,
 alone immortal steeds adorn.”
 
thus hector swore: gods call’d vain,
 rash youth prepares scour plain:
 across back bended bow flung,
 wolf’s grey hide around shoulders hung,
 ferret’s downy fur helmet lined,
 hand pointed javelin shined.
 (never return) sought shore,
 trod path feet must tread more.
 scarce pass’d steeds trojan throng,
 (still bending forward coursed along,)
 when, hollow way, approaching tread
 ulysses mark’d, thus diomed;
 
“o friend! hear step hostile feet,
 moving way, hastening fleet;
 spy, perhaps, lurk beside main;
 nightly pillager strips slain.
 yet let pass, win little space;
 rush behind him, prevent pace.
 swift foot flies before,
 confine course along fleet shore,
 betwixt camp spears employ,
 intercept hoped return troy.”
 
stepp’d aside, stoop’d head,
 (as dolon pass’d,) behind heap dead:
 along path spy unwary flew;
 soft, just distance, chiefs pursue.
 distant they, space between,
 two teams mules divide green,
 (to hind like shares land allows,)
 now new furrows part approaching ploughs.
 now dolon, listening, heard pass’d;
 hector (he thought) sent, check’d haste,
 till scarce distance javelin’s throw,
 voice succeeding, perceived foe.
 two skilful hounds leveret wind;
 chase woods obscure trembling hind;
 now lost, now seen, intercept way,
 herd still turn flying prey:
 fast, fears, trojan flew;
 close, constant, bold greeks pursue.
 now almost fleet dastard falls,
 mingles guards watch walls;
 brave tydides stopp’d; gen’rous thought
 (inspired pallas) bosom wrought,
 lest foe forward greek advance,
 snatch glory lifted lance.
 thus aloud: “whoe’er thou art, remain;
 javelin else shall fix thee plain.”
 said, high air weapon cast,
 wilful err’d, o’er shoulder pass’d;
 fix’d earth. trembling wood
 wretch stood propp’d, quiver’d stood;
 sudden palsy seized turning head;
 loose teeth chatter’d, colour fled;
 panting warriors seize stands,
 unmanly tears life demands.
 
“o spare youth, breath owe,
 large gifts price father shall bestow:
 vast heaps brass shall ships told,
 steel well-temper’d refulgent gold.”
 
ulysses made wise reply:
 “whoe’er thou art, bold, fear die.
 moves thee, say, sleep closed sight,
 roam silent fields dead night?
 cam’st thou secrets camp find,
 hector prompted, thy daring mind?
 art wretch hopes plunder led,
 heaps carnage, despoil dead?”
 
thus pale dolon, fearful look:
 (still, spoke, limbs horror shook:)
 “hither came, hector’s words deceived;
 much promise, rashly believed:
 less bribe great achilles’ car,
 swift steeds sweep ranks war,
 urged me, unwilling, attempt make;
 learn counsels, resolves take:
 now subdued, fix hopes flight,
 and, tired toils, neglect watch night.”
 
“bold thy aim, glorious prize,
 (ulysses, scornful smile, replies,)
 far rulers proud steeds demand,
 scorn guidance vulgar hand;
 even great achilles scarce rage can tame,
 achilles sprung immortal dame.
 say, faithful, truth recite!
 lies encamp’d trojan chief to-night?
 stand coursers? quarter sleep
 princes? tell watch keep:
 say, since conquest, counsels are;
 combat, city far,
 back ilion’s walls transfer war?”
 
ulysses thus, thus eumedes’ son:
 “what dolon knows, faithful tongue shall own.
 hector, peers assembling tent,
 council holds ilus’ monument.
 certain guards nightly watch partake;
 where’er yon fires ascend, trojans wake:
 anxious troy, guard natives keep;
 safe cares, auxiliar forces sleep,
 whose wives infants, danger far,
 discharge souls half fears war.”
 
“then sleep aids among trojan train,
 (inquired chief,) scattered o’er plain?”
 spy: “their powers thus dispose
 paeons, dreadful bended bows,
 carians, caucons, pelasgian host,
 leleges, encamp along coast.
 distant far, lie higher land
 lycian, mysian, mæonian band,
 phrygia’s horse, thymbras’ ancient wall;
 thracians utmost, apart all.
 troy lately succour won,
 led rhesus, great eioneus’ son:
 saw coursers proud triumph go,
 swift wind, white winter-snow;
 rich silver plates shining car infold;
 solid arms, refulgent, flame gold;
 mortal shoulders suit glorious load,
 celestial panoply, grace god!
 let me, unhappy, fleet borne,
 leave here, captive’s fate mourn,
 cruel chains, till return reveal
 truth falsehood news tell.”
 
tydides, gloomy frown:
 “think live, though truth shown:
 shall dismiss thee, future strife
 risk bravely thy now forfeit life?
 camps thou may’st explore?
 no—once traitor, thou betray’st more.”
 
sternly spoke, wretch prepared
 humble blandishment stroke beard,
 like lightning swift wrathful falchion flew,
 divides neck, cuts nerves two;
 one instant snatch’d trembling soul hell,
 head, yet speaking, mutter’d fell.
 furry helmet brow tear,
 wolf’s grey hide, unbended bow spear;
 great ulysses lifting skies,
 favouring pallas dedicates prize:
 
“great queen arms, receive hostile spoil,
 let thracian steeds reward toil;
 thee, first heavenly host, praise;
 speed labours, direct ways!”
 said, spoils, dropping gore defaced,
 high spreading tamarisk placed;
 heap’d reeds gathered boughs plain,
 guide footsteps place again.
 
still night cross devious fields,
 slippery blood, o’er arms heaps shields,
 arriving thracian squadrons lay,
 eased sleep labours day.
 ranged three lines view prostrate band:
 horses yoked beside warrior stand.
 arms order ground reclined,
 brown shade fulgid weapons shined:
 amidst lay rhesus, stretch’d sleep profound,
 white steeds behind chariot bound.
 welcome sight ulysses first descries,
 points diomed tempting prize.
 “the man, coursers, car behold!
 described dolon, arms gold.
 now, brave tydides! now thy courage try,
 approach chariot, steeds untie;
 thy soul aspire fiercer deeds,
 urge thou slaughter, seize steeds.”
 
pallas (this said) hero’s bosom warms,
 breathed heart, strung nervous arms;
 where’er pass’d, purple stream pursued
 thirsty falchion, fat hostile blood,
 bathed footsteps, dyed fields gore,
 low groan remurmur’d shore.
 grim lion, nightly den,
 o’erleaps fences, invades pen,
 sheep goats, resistless way,
 falls, foaming rends guardless prey;
 stopp’d fury vengeful hand,
 till twelve lay breathless thracian band.
 ulysses following, partner slew,
 back foot slaughter’d warrior drew;
 milk-white coursers studious convey
 safe ships, wisely cleared way:
 lest fierce steeds, yet battles bred,
 start, tremble heaps dead.
 now twelve despatch’d, monarch last found;
 tydides’ falchion fix’d ground.
 just deathful dream minerva sent,
 warlike form appear’d tent,
 whose visionary steel bosom tore:
 dream’d monarch, awaked more.[218]
 
ulysses now snowy steeds detains,
 leads them, fasten’d silver reins;
 these, bow unbent, lash’d along;
 (the scourge forgot, rhesus’ chariot hung;)
 gave friend signal retire;
 him, new dangers, new achievements fire;
 doubtful stood, reeking blade
 send heroes infernal shade,
 drag car rhesus’ armour lay,
 heave manly force, lift away.
 unresolved tydeus stands,
 pallas appears, thus chief commands:
 
“enough, son; slaughter cease,
 regard thy safety, depart peace;
 haste ships, gotten spoils enjoy,
 tempt far hostile gods troy.”
 
voice divine confess’d martial maid;
 haste mounted, word obey’d;
 coursers fly ulysses’ bow,
 swift wind, white winter-snow.
 
unobserved pass’d: god light
 watch’d troy, mark’d minerva’s flight,
 saw tydeus’ heavenly succour bless’d,
 vengeful anger fill’d sacred breast.
 swift trojan camp descends power,
 wakes hippocoon morning-hour;
 (on rhesus’ side accustom’d attend,
 faithful kinsman, instructive friend;)
 rose, saw field deform’d blood,
 empty space late coursers stood,
 yet-warm thracians panting coast;
 wept, rhesus most:
 now rhesus’ name calls vain,
 gathering tumult spreads o’er plain;
 heaps trojans rush, wild affright,
 wondering view slaughters night.
 
meanwhile chiefs, arriving shade
 late spoils hector’s spy laid,
 ulysses stopp’d; tydides bore
 trophy, dropping yet dolon’s gore:
 mounts again; nimbler feet
 coursers ply, thunder towards fleet.
 

[illustration: ] diomed ulysses returning spoils rhesus
 

old nestor first perceived approaching sound,
 bespeaking thus grecian peers around:
 “methinks noise trampling steeds hear,
 thickening way, gathering ear;
 perhaps horses trojan breed
 (so may, ye gods! pious hopes succeed)
 great tydides ulysses bear,
 return’d triumphant prize war.
 yet much fear (ah, may fear vain!)
 chiefs outnumber’d trojan train;
 perhaps, even now pursued, seek shore;
 or, oh! perhaps heroes more.”
 
scarce spoke, when, lo! chiefs appear,
 spring earth; greeks dismiss fear:
 words friendship extended hands
 greet kings; nestor first demands:
 
“say thou, whose praises host proclaim,
 thou living glory grecian name!
 say whence coursers? chance bestow’d,
 spoil foes, present god?
 fair steeds, radiant gay,
 draw burning chariot day.
 old am, age scorn yield,
 daily mingle martial field;
 sure till now coursers struck sight
 like these, conspicuous ranks fight.
 god, deem, conferred glorious prize,
 bless’d ye are, favourites skies;
 care bids thunder roar,
 her, whose fury bathes world gore.”
 
“father! so, (sage ithacus rejoin’d,)
 gifts heaven nobler kind.
 thracian lineage steeds ye view,
 whose hostile king brave tydides slew;
 sleeping died, guards around,
 twelve beside lay gasping ground.
 spoils conquer’d dolon came,
 wretch, whose swiftness fame;
 hector sent forces explore,
 now lies headless sandy shore.”
 
o’er trench bounding coursers flew;
 joyful greeks loud acclaim pursue.
 straight tydides’ high pavilion borne,
 matchless steeds ample stalls adorn:
 neighing coursers new fellows greet,
 full racks heap’d generous wheat.
 dolon’s armour, ships convey’d,
 high painted stern ulysses laid,
 trophy destin’d blue-eyed maid.
 
now nocturnal sweat sanguine stain
 cleanse bodies neighb’ring main:
 polished bath, refresh’d toil,
 joints supple dissolving oil,
 due repast indulge genial hour,
 first pallas libations pour:
 sit, rejoicing aid divine,
 crown’d goblet foams floods wine.

saffron morn, early blushes spread,[219]

[illustration: ] descent discord
 

king men hardy host inspires
 loud command, great example fires!
 first rose, rest
 mighty limbs radiant armour dress’d,
 first cased manly legs around
 shining greaves silver buckles bound;
 beaming cuirass next adorn’d breast,
 king cinyras possess’d:
 (the fame greece assembled host
 reach’d monarch cyprian coast;
 ’twas then, friendship chief gain,
 glorious gift sent, sent vain:)
 ten rows azure steel work infold,
 twice ten tin, twelve ductile gold;
 three glittering dragons gorget rise,
 whose imitated scales skies
 reflected various light, arching bow’d,
 like colour’d rainbows o’er showery cloud
 (jove’s wondrous bow, three celestial dies,
 placed sign man amidst skies).
 radiant baldric, o’er shoulder tied,
 sustain’d sword glitter’d side:
 gold hilt, silver sheath encased
 shining blade, golden hangers graced.
 buckler’s mighty orb next display’d,
 round warrior cast dreadful shade;
 ten zones brass ample brim surround,
 twice ten bosses bright convex crown’d:
 tremendous gorgon frown’d upon field,
 circling terrors fill’d expressive shield:
 within concave hung silver thong,
 mimic serpent creeps along,
 azure length easy waves extends,
 till three heads embroider’d monster ends.
 last o’er brows fourfold helm placed,
 nodding horse-hair formidably graced;
 hands two steely javelins wields,
 blaze heaven, lighten fields.
 
instant juno, martial maid,
 happy thunders promised greece aid;
 high o’er chief clash’d arms air,
 and, leaning clouds, expect war.
 
close limits trench mound,
 fiery coursers chariots bound
 squires restrain’d: foot, wield
 lighter arms, rush forward field.
 second these, close array combined,
 squadrons spread sable wings behind.
 now shouts tumults wake tardy sun,
 light warriors’ toils begun.
 even jove, whose thunder spoke wrath, distill’d
 red drops blood o’er fatal field;[220]
 woes men unwilling survey,
 slaughters must stain day.
 
near ilus’ tomb, order ranged around,
 trojan lines possess’d rising ground:
 wise polydamas hector stood;
 Æneas, honour’d guardian god;
 bold polybus, agenor divine;
 brother-warriors antenor’s line:
 youthful acamas, whose beauteous face
 fair proportion match’d ethereal race.
 great hector, cover’d spacious shield,
 plies troops, orders field.
 red star now shows sanguine fires
 dark clouds, now night retires,
 thus ranks appear’d godlike man,
 plunged rear, blazing van;
 streamy sparkles, restless flies,
 flash arms, lightning skies.
 sweating reapers wealthy field,
 ranged two bands, crooked weapons wield,
 bear furrows, till labours meet;
 thick fall heapy harvests feet:
 greece troy field war divide,
 falling ranks strow’d every side.
 none stoop’d thought base inglorious flight;[221]
 horse horse, man man fight,
 rabid wolves fierce contest prey;
 wounds, bleeds, none resign day.
 discord joy scene death descries,
 drinks large slaughter sanguine eyes:
 discord alone, immortal train,
 swells red horrors direful plain:
 gods peace golden mansions fill,
 ranged bright order olympian hill:
 general murmurs told griefs above,
 accused partial will jove.
 meanwhile apart, superior, alone,
 eternal monarch, awful throne,
 wrapt blaze boundless glory sate;
 fix’d, fulfill’d just decrees fate.
 earth turn’d all-considering eyes,
 mark’d spot ilion’s towers arise;
 ships, fields armies spread,
 victor’s rage, dying, dead.
 
thus morning-beams, increasing bright,
 o’er heaven’s pure azure spread glowing light,
 commutual death fate war confounds,
 adverse battle gored equal wounds.
 now (what time sequester’d vale
 weary woodman spreads sparing meal,
 tired arms refuse axe rear,
 claim respite sylvan war;
 till half prostrate forests lay
 stretch’d long ruin, exposed day)
 then, till then, greeks’ impulsive might
 pierced black phalanx, let light.
 great agamemnon slaughter led,
 slew bienor people’s head:
 whose squire oïleus, sudden spring,
 leap’d chariot revenge king;
 front felt fatal wound,
 pierced brain, stretch’d ground.
 atrides spoil’d, left plain:
 vain youth, glittering armour vain:
 now soil’d dust, naked sky,
 snowy limbs beauteous bodies lie.
 
two sons priam next battle move,
 product, one marriage, one love:[222]
 car brother-warriors ride;
 took charge combat, guide:
 far task, wont keep,
 ida’s tops, father’s fleecy sheep.
 mountains achilles found,
 captive led, pliant osiers bound;
 sire ample sums restored;
 now perish atrides’ sword:
 pierced breast base-born isus bleeds:
 cleft head brother’s fate succeeds,
 swift spoil hasty victor falls,
 and, stript, features mind recalls.
 trojans see youths untimely die,
 helpless tremble themselves, fly.
 lion ranging o’er lawns,
 finds, grassy lair, couching fawns,
 bones cracks, reeking vitals draws,
 grinds quivering flesh bloody jaws;
 frighted hind beholds, dares stay,
 swift rustling thickets bursts way;
 drown’d sweat, panting mother flies,
 big tears roll trickling eyes.
 
amidst tumult routed train,
 sons false antimachus slain;
 bribes faithless counsels sold,
 voted helen’s stay paris’ gold.
 atrides mark’d, safety sought,
 slew children father’s fault;
 headstrong horse unable restrain,
 shook fear, dropp’d silken rein;
 chariot knees fall,
 thus lifted hands mercy call:
 
“o spare youth, life owe,
 antimachus shall copious gifts bestow:
 soon hears, that, battle slain,
 grecian ships captive sons detain,
 large heaps brass ransom shall told,
 steel well-tempered, persuasive gold.”
 
words, attended flood tears,
 youths address’d unrelenting ears:
 vengeful monarch gave stern reply:
 “if antimachus ye spring, ye die;
 daring wretch council stood
 shed ulysses’ brother’s blood,
 proffer’d peace! sues seed grace?
 no, die, pay forfeit race.”
 
said, pisander car cast,
 pierced breast: supine breathed last.
 brother leap’d earth; but, lay,
 trenchant falchion lopp’d hands away;
 sever’d head toss’d among throng,
 and, rolling, drew bloody train along.
 then, thickest fought, victor flew;
 king’s example greeks pursue.
 now foot flying foot slain,
 horse trod horse, lay foaming plain.
 dry fields thick clouds dust arise,
 shade black host, intercept skies.
 brass-hoof’d steeds tumultuous plunge bound,
 thick thunder beats labouring ground,
 still slaughtering on, king men proceeds;
 distanced army wonders deeds,
 winds raging flames conspire,
 o’er forests roll flood fire,
 blazing heaps grove’s old honours fall,
 one refulgent ruin levels all:
 atrides’ rage sinks foe,
 whole squadrons vanish, proud heads lie low.
 steeds fly trembling waving sword,
 many car, now lighted lord,
 wide o’er field guideless fury rolls,
 breaking ranks, crushing souls;
 keen falchion drinks warriors’ lives;
 grateful, now, vultures wives!
 
perhaps great hector found fate,
 jove destiny prolong’d date.
 safe darts, care heaven stood,
 amidst alarms, death, dust, blood.
 
now past tomb ancient ilus lay,
 mid field routed urge way:
 wild figs adjoining summit crown,
 path take, speed reach town.
 swift, atrides loud shouts pursued,
 hot toil, bathed hostile blood.
 now near beech-tree, scæan gates,
 hero halts, associates waits.
 meanwhile every side around plain,
 dispersed, disorder’d, fly trojan train.
 flies herd beeves, hear dismay’d
 lion’s roaring midnight shade;
 heaps tumble successless haste;
 savage seizes, draws, rends last.
 less fury stern atrides flew,
 still press’d rout, still hindmost slew;
 hurl’d cars bravest chiefs kill’d,
 rage, death, carnage load field.
 
now storms victor trojan wall;
 surveys towers, meditates fall.
 jove descending shook idaean hills,
 summits pour’d hundred rills:
 unkindled lightning hand took,
 thus many-coloured maid bespoke:
 
“iris, haste thy golden wings display,
 godlike hector word convey—
 agamemnon wastes ranks around,
 fights front, bathes blood ground,
 bid give way; issue forth commands,
 trust war less important hands:
 when, wounded spear dart,
 chief shall mount chariot, depart,
 jove shall string arm, fire breast,
 ships shall flying greece press’d,
 till main burning sun descend,
 sacred night awful shade extend.”
 
spoke, iris word obey’d;
 wings winds descends various maid.
 chief found amidst ranks war,
 close bulwarks, glittering car.
 goddess then: “o priam, hear!
 jove come, high mandate bear.
 agamemnon wastes ranks around,
 fights front, bathes blood ground,
 abstain fight; yet issue forth commands,
 trust war less important hands:
 when, wounded spear dart,
 chief shall mount chariot, depart,
 jove shall string thy arm, fire thy breast,
 ships shall flying greece press’d,
 till main burning sun descend,
 sacred night awful shade extend.”
 
said, vanish’d. hector, bound,
 springs chariot trembling ground,
 clanging arms: grasps either hand
 pointed lance, speeds band band;
 revives ardour, turns steps flight,
 wakes anew dying flames fight.
 stand arms: greeks onset dare,
 condense powers, wait coming war.
 new force, new spirit, breast returns;
 fight renew’d fiercer fury burns:
 king leads on: fix eye,
 learn conquer, die.
 
ye sacred nine! celestial muses! tell,
 faced first, prowess fell?
 great iphidamas, bold young,
 sage antenor theano sprung;
 youth grandsire cisseus bred,
 nursed thrace snowy flocks fed.
 scarce rosy cheeks invest,
 early honour warm generous breast,
 kind sire consign’d daughter’s charms
 (theano’s sister) youthful arms.
 call’d glory wars troy,
 leaves untasted first fruits joy;
 loved bride departs melting eyes,
 swift aid dearer country flies.
 twelve black ships reach’d percope’s strand,
 thence took long laborious march land.
 now fierce fame, ranks springs,
 towering arms, braves king kings.
 atrides first discharged missive spear;
 trojan stoop’d, javelin pass’d air.
 near corslet, monarch’s heart,
 strength, youth directs dart:
 broad belt, plates silver bound,
 point rebated, repell’d wound.
 encumber’d dart, atrides stands,
 till, grasp’d force, wrench’d hands;
 weighty sword discharged wound
 full neck, fell’d ground.
 stretch’d dust unhappy warrior lies,
 sleep eternal seals swimming eyes.
 oh worthy better fate! oh early slain!
 thy country’s friend; virtuous, though vain!
 youth shall join consort’s side,
 virgin, bride!
 presents embraces meet,
 lay spoils conquest feet,
 passion, lavish store,
 bestow’d much, vainly promised more!
 unwept, uncover’d, plain lay,
 proud victor bore arms away.
 
coon, antenor’s eldest hope, nigh:
 tears, sight, came starting eye,
 pierced grief much-loved youth view’d,
 pale features now deform’d blood.
 then, spear, unseen, time took,
 aim’d king, near elbow strook.
 thrilling steel transpierced brawny part,
 arm stood forth barbed dart.
 surprised monarch feels, yet void fear
 coon rushes lifted spear:
 brother’s corpse pious trojan draws,
 calls country assert cause;
 defends breathless sanguine field,
 o’er body spreads ample shield.
 atrides, marking unguarded part,
 transfix’d warrior brazen dart;
 prone brother’s bleeding breast lay,
 monarch’s falchion lopp’d head away:
 social shades dark journey go,
 join realms below.
 
vengeful victor rages round fields,
 every weapon art fury yields:
 long lance, sword, ponderous stone,
 whole ranks broken, whole troops o’erthrown.
 this, yet warm distill’d purple flood;
 wound grew stiff clotted blood,
 grinding tortures strong bosom rend,
 less keen darts fierce ilythiae send:
 (the powers cause teeming matron’s throes,
 sad mothers unutterable woes!)
 stung smart, all-panting pain,
 mounts car, gives squire rein;
 voice fury made strong,
 pain augmented, thus exhorts throng:
 
“o friends! greeks! assert honours won;
 proceed, finish arm begun:
 lo! angry jove forbids chief stay,
 envies half glories day.”
 
said: driver whirls lengthful thong;
 horses fly; chariot smokes along.
 clouds nostrils fierce coursers blow,
 sides foam descends snow;
 shot battle moment’s space,
 wounded monarch tent place.
 
sooner hector saw king retired,
 thus trojans aids fired:
 “hear, ye dardan, ye lycian race!
 famed close fight, dreadful face face:
 now call mind ancient trophies won,
 great forefathers’ virtues, own.
 behold, general flies! deserts powers!
 lo, jove declares conquest ours!
 now yon ranks impel foaming steeds;
 and, sure glory, dare immortal deeds.”
 
words like fiery chief alarms
 fainting host, every bosom warms.
 bold hunter cheers hounds tear
 brindled lion, tusky bear:
 voice hand provokes doubting heart,
 springs foremost lifted dart:
 godlike hector prompts troops dare;
 prompts alone, leads war.
 black body foe pours;
 cloud’s deep bosom, swell’d showers,
 sudden storm purple ocean sweeps,
 drives wild waves, tosses deeps.
 say, muse! jove trojan’s glory crown’d,
 beneath arm heroes bit ground?
 assaeus, dolops, autonous died,
 opites next added side;
 brave hipponous, famed many fight,
 opheltius, orus, sunk endless night;
 Æsymnus, agelaus; chiefs name;
 rest vulgar deaths unknown fame.
 western whirlwind, charged storms,
 dispels gather’d clouds notus forms:
 gust continued, violent strong,
 rolls sable clouds heaps heaps along;
 now skies foaming billows rears,
 now breaks surge, wide bottom bares:
 thus, raging hector, resistless hands,
 o’erturns, confounds, scatters bands.
 now last ruin whole host appals;
 now greece trembled wooden walls;
 wise ulysses call’d tydides forth,
 soul rekindled, awaked worth.
 “and stand deedless, eternal shame!
 till hector’s arm involve ships flame?
 haste, let us join, combat side side.”
 warrior thus, thus friend replied:
 
“no martial toil shun, danger fear;
 let hector come; wait fury here.
 jove conquest crowns trojan train:
 and, jove foe, human force vain.”
 
sigh’d; but, sighing, raised vengeful steel,
 car proud thymbraeus fell:
 molion, charioteer, pursued lord,
 death ennobled ulysses’ sword.
 slain, left eternal night,
 plunged amidst thickest ranks fight.
 two wild boars outstrip following hounds,
 swift revert, wounds return wounds.
 stern hector’s conquests middle plain
 stood check’d awhile, greece respired again.
 
sons merops shone amidst war;
 towering rode one refulgent car:
 deep prophetic arts father skill’d,
 warn’d children trojan field.
 fate urged on: father warn’d vain;
 rush’d fight, perish’d plain;
 breasts vital spirit warms;
 stern tydides strips shining arms.
 hypirochus great ulysses dies,
 rich hippodamus becomes prize.
 great jove ide slaughter fills sight,
 level hangs doubtful scale fight.
 tydeus’ lance agastrophus slain,
 far-famed hero pæonian strain;
 wing’d fears, foot strove fly,
 steeds distant, foe nigh:
 broken orders, swifter wind,
 fled, flying left life behind.
 hector sees, experienced eyes
 traverse files, rescue flies;
 shouts, pass’d, crystal regions rend,
 moving armies march attend.
 great diomed seized fear,
 thus bespoke brother war:
 
“mark way yon bending squadrons yield!
 storm rolls on, hector rules field:
 stand utmost force.”—the warrior said;
 swift word ponderous javelin fled;
 miss’d aim, plumage danced
 razed smooth cone, thence obliquely glanced.
 safe helm (the gift phœbus’ hands)
 without wound trojan hero stands;
 yet stunn’d, that, staggering plain.
 arm knee sinking bulk sustain;
 o’er dim sight misty vapours rise,
 short darkness shades swimming eyes.
 tydides followed regain lance;
 hector rose, recover’d trance,
 remounts car, herds amidst crowd:
 greek pursues him, exults aloud:
 “once thank phœbus thy forfeit breath,
 thank swiftness outstrips death.
 well apollo thy prayers repaid,
 oft partial power lent aid.
 thou shall long death deserved withstand,
 god assist tydides’ hand.
 fly then, inglorious! thy flight, day,
 whole hecatombs trojan ghosts shall pay,”
 
him, triumph’d, paris eyed far,
 (the spouse helen, fair cause war;)
 around fields feather’d shafts sent,
 ancient ilus’ ruin’d monument:
 behind column placed, bent bow,
 wing’d arrow unwary foe;
 just stoop’d, agastrophus’s crest
 seize, drew corslet breast,
 bowstring twang’d; flew shaft vain,
 pierced foot, nail’d plain.
 laughing trojan, joyful spring.
 leaps ambush, insults king.
 
“he bleeds! (he cries) god sped dart!
 god fix’d heart!
 troy, relieved wide-wasting hand,
 breathe slaughter combat stand:
 whose sons now tremble darted spear,
 scatter’d lambs rushing lion fear.”
 
dauntless thus: “thou conqueror fair,
 thou woman-warrior curling hair;
 vain archer! trusting distant dart,
 unskill’d arms act manly part!
 thou hast done boys women can;
 hands may wound, incense man.
 boast scratch thy feeble arrow gave,
 coward’s weapon never hurts brave.
 dart, thou may’st one day feel;
 fate wings flight, death steel:
 lights, noble life expires;
 touch makes orphans, bathes cheeks sires,
 steeps earth purple, gluts birds air,
 leaves objects distract fair.”
 ulysses hastens trembling heart,
 steps, bending draws dart:
 forth flows blood; eager pang succeeds;
 tydides mounts, navy speeds.
 
now field ulysses stands alone,
 greeks fled, trojans pouring on;
 stands collected himself, whole,
 questions thus unconquer’d soul:
 
“what subterfuge, hopes remain?
 shame, inglorious quit plain?
 danger, singly stand ground,
 friends scatter’d, foes around?
 yet wherefore doubtful? let truth suffice,
 brave meets danger, coward flies.
 die conquer, proves hero’s heart;
 and, knowing this, know soldier’s part.”
 
thoughts revolving careful breast,
 near, near, shady cohorts press’d;
 these, warrior, fate enclose;
 round deep steely circle grows.
 fares boar troop surrounds
 shouting huntsmen clamorous hounds;
 grinds ivory tusks; foams ire;
 sanguine eye-balls glare living fire;
 these, those, every part plied;
 red slaughter spreads every side.
 pierced shoulder, first deiopis fell;
 next ennomus thoon sank hell;
 chersidamas, beneath navel thrust,
 falls prone earth, grasps bloody dust.
 charops, hippasus, near;
 ulysses reach’d fatal spear;
 aid brother socus flies,
 socus brave, generous, wise.
 near drew, warrior thus began:
 
“o great ulysses! much-enduring man!
 deeper skill’d every martial sleight,
 worn toils, active fight!
 day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,
 end great hippasian race,
 thou beneath lance must press field.”
 said, forceful pierced spacious shield:
 strong brass ringing javelin thrown,
 plough’d half side, bared bone.
 pallas’ care, spear, though deep infix’d,
 stopp’d short life, entrails mix’d.
 
wound mortal wise ulysses knew,
 furious thus (but first steps withdrew):
 “unhappy man! whose death hands shall grace,
 fate calls thee hence finish’d thy race.
 longer check conquests foe;
 but, pierced this, endless darkness go,
 add one spectre realms below!”
 
spoke, socus, seized sudden fright,
 trembling gave way, turn’d back flight;
 shoulders pierced following dart,
 held passage panting heart:
 wide breast appear’d grisly wound;
 falls; armour rings ground.
 thus ulysses, gazing slain:
 “famed hippasus! press plain;
 ends thy narrow span assign’d fate,
 heaven owes ulysses yet longer date.
 ah, wretch! father shall thy corpse compose;
 thy dying eyes tender mother close;
 hungry birds shall tear balls away,
 hovering vultures scream around prey.
 greece shall honour, meet doom,
 solemn funerals lasting tomb.”
 
raging intolerable smart,
 writhes body, extracts dart.
 dart tide spouting gore pursued,
 gladden’d troy sight hostile blood.
 now troops troops fainting chief invade,
 forced recedes, loudly calls aid.
 thrice pitch lofty voice rears;
 well-known voice thrice menelaus hears:
 alarm’d, ajax telamon cried,
 shares labours, defends side:
 “o friend! ulysses’ shouts invade ear;
 distressed seems, assistance near;
 strong is, yet one opposed all,
 oppress’d multitudes, best may fall.
 greece robb’d must bid host despair,
 feel loss ages can repair.”
 
then, cry directs, course bends;
 great ajax, like god war, attends,
 prudent chief sore distress found,
 bands furious trojans compass’d round.[223]
 huntsman, flying spear,
 blind thicket wounds stately deer;
 cleft side, fresh blood distils,
 bounds aloft, scuds hills hills,
 till life’s warm vapour issuing wound,
 wild mountain-wolves fainting beast surround:
 just jaws prostrate limbs invade,
 lion rushes woodland shade,
 wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;
 lordly savage vindicates prey.
 ulysses thus, unconquer’d pains,
 single warrior half host sustains:
 soon ajax leaves tower-like shield,
 scattered crowds fly frighted o’er field;
 atrides’ arm sinking hero stays,
 and, saved numbers, car conveys.
 
victorious ajax plies routed crew;
 first doryclus, priam’s son, slew,
 strong pandocus next inflicts wound,
 lays lysander bleeding ground.
 torrent, swell’d wintry rains,
 pours mountains o’er deluged plains,
 pines oaks, foundations torn,
 country’s ruins! seas borne:
 fierce ajax thus o’erwhelms yielding throng;
 men, steeds, chariots, roll heaps along.
 
hector, scene slaughter far,
 raged left, ruled tide war:
 loud groans proclaim progress plain,
 deep scamander swells heaps slain.
 nestor idomeneus oppose
 warrior’s fury; battle glows;
 fierce foot, chariot’s height,
 sword deforms beauteous ranks fight.
 spouse helen, dealing darts around,
 pierced machaon distant wound:
 right shoulder broad shaft appear’d,
 trembling greece physician fear’d.
 nestor idomeneus begun:
 “glory greece, old neleus’ valiant son!
 ascend thy chariot, haste speed away,
 great machaon ships convey;
 wise physician skill’d wounds heal,
 armies public weal.”
 old nestor mounts seat; beside rode
 wounded offspring healing god.
 lends lash; steeds sounding feet
 shake dry field, thunder toward fleet.
 
now cebriones, hector’s car,
 survey’d various fortune war:
 “while (he cried) flying greeks slain,
 trojans trojans yonder load plain.
 great ajax see mingled throng
 men chariots driven heaps along!
 know well, distinguish’d o’er field
 broad glittering sevenfold shield.
 thither, hector, thither urge thy steeds,
 danger calls, combat bleeds;
 horse foot mingled deaths unite,
 groans slaughter mix shouts fight.”
 
thus spoke, driver’s lash resounds;
 swift ranks rapid chariot bounds;
 stung stroke, coursers scour fields,
 o’er heaps carcases, hills shields.
 horses’ hoofs bathed heroes’ gore,
 and, dashing, purple car before;
 groaning axle sable drops distils,
 mangled carnage clogs rapid wheels.
 hector, plunging thickest fight,
 broke dark phalanx, let light:
 (by long lance, sword, ponderous stone,
 ranks scatter’d troops o’erthrown:)
 ajax shuns, dire debate,
 fears arm whose force felt late.
 partial jove, espousing hector’s part,
 shot heaven-bred horror grecian’s heart;
 confused, unnerved hector’s presence grown,
 amazed stood, terrors own.
 o’er broad back moony shield threw,
 and, glaring round, tardy steps withdrew.
 thus grim lion retreat maintains,
 beset watchful dogs, shouting swains;
 repulsed numbers nightly stalls,
 though rage impels him, though hunger calls,
 long stands showering darts, missile fires;
 sourly slow indignant beast retires:
 turn’d stern ajax, whole hosts repell’d,
 swoln heart every step rebell’d.
 
slow beast, heavy strength endued,
 wide field troops boys pursued,
 though round sides wooden tempest rain,
 crops tall harvest, lays waste plain;
 thick hide hollow blows resound,
 patient animal maintains ground,
 scarce field efforts chased,
 stirs slowly stirs last:
 ajax thus weight trojans hung,
 strokes redoubled buckler rung;
 confiding now bulky strength stands,
 now turns, backward bears yielding bands;
 now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems fly,
 threats followers retorted eye.
 fix’d bar two warring powers,
 hissing darts descend iron showers:
 broad buckler many weapon stood,
 surface bristled quivering wood;
 many javelin, guiltless plain,
 marks dry dust, thirsts blood vain.
 bold eurypylus aid imparts,
 dauntless springs beneath cloud darts;
 whose eager javelin launch’d foe,
 great apisaon felt fatal blow;
 torn liver red current flow’d,
 slack knees desert dying load.
 victor rushing despoil dead,
 paris’ bow vengeful arrow fled;
 fix’d nervous thigh weapon stood,
 fix’d point, broken wood.
 back lines wounded greek retired,
 yet thus retreating, associates fired:
 
“what god, grecians! hearts dismay’d?
 oh, turn arms; ’tis ajax claims aid.
 hour stands mark hostile rage,
 last brave battle shall wage:
 haste, join forces; gloomy grave
 warrior rescue, country save.”
 thus urged chief: generous troop appears,
 spread bucklers, advance spears,
 guard wounded friend: thus stand
 pious care, great ajax joins band:
 takes new courage hero’s sight;
 hero rallies, renews fight.
 
thus raged armies like conflicting fires,
 nestor’s chariot far fight retires:
 coursers steep’d sweat, stain’d gore,
 greeks’ preserver, great machaon, bore.
 hour achilles, topmost height
 proud fleet, o’erlook’d fields fight;
 feasted eyes beheld around plain
 grecian rout, slaying, slain.
 friend machaon singled rest,
 transient pity touch’d vengeful breast.
 straight menoetius’ much-loved sent:
 graceful mars, patroclus quits tent;
 evil hour! fate decreed doom,
 fix’d date woes come.
 
“why calls friend? thy loved injunctions lay;

battle grecian wall.
 

greeks retired intrenchments, hector attempts to
 force them; proving impossible pass ditch, polydamas
 advises quit chariots, manage attack foot. the
 trojans follow counsel; divided army five
 bodies foot, begin assault. upon signal eagle with
 serpent talons, appeared left hand the
 trojans, polydamas endeavours withdraw again. hector
 opposes, continues attack; which, many actions,
 sarpedon makes first breach wall. hector also, casting a
 stone vast size, forces open one gates, enters the
 head troops, victoriously pursue grecians even their
 ships.
 

thus hero’s pious cares attend
 cure safety wounded friend,
 trojans greeks clashing shields engage,
 mutual deaths dealt mutual rage.
 long trench lofty walls oppose;
 gods averse ill-fated works arose;
 powers neglected, victim slain,
 walls raised, trenches sunk vain.
 
without gods, short period stands

 saw polydamas; who, wisely brave,
 restrain’d great hector, counsel gave:
 
“o thou, bold leader trojan bands!
 you, confederate chiefs foreign lands!
 entrance can cumbrous chariots find,
 stakes beneath, grecian walls behind?
 pass those, without thousand wounds,
 space combat yon narrow bounds.
 proud favours mighty jove shown,
 certain dangers rashly run:
 ’tis will haughty foes tame,
 oh may instant end grecian name!
 here, far argos, let heroes fall,
 one great day destroy bury all!
 turn, oppress train,

 wedged trench, troops confused,

 troy must perish, arms prevail,

 alighting, wedged firm array,
 proceed foot, hector lead way.
 greece shall stoop conquering power,
 (if jove consent) fatal hour.”
 

[illustration: ] polydamas advising hector
 

counsel pleased: godlike hector sprung
 swift seat; clanging armour rung.

 compel coursers ranks behind.

 obey several chiefs’ commands.
 best bravest first conspire,
 pant fight, threat fleet fire:
 great hector glorious these,
 polydamas, brave cebriones.

 unhappy hero! advised vain;

 fierce left drives, plain
 flying grecians strove ships gain;

 thither, exulting force, flies:
 following host clamours rend skies:
 plunge grecians headlong main,

 polypœtes, great perithous’ heir,
 leonteus, like god war.
 two tall oaks, wall rise;
 roots earth, heads amidst skies:
 whose spreading arms leafy honours crown’d,

 graceful these, shock stand
 raging asius, furious band.
 orestes, acamas, front appear,
 Œnomaus thoon close rear:
 vain clamours shake ambient fields,
 vain around beat hollow shields;
 fearless brothers grecians call,
 guard navies, defend wall.
 even saw troy’s sable troops impend,
 greece tumultuous towers descend,
 forth portals rush’d intrepid pair,
 opposed breasts, stood war.
 two wild boars spring furious den,
 roused cries dogs voice men;
 every side crackling trees tear,
 root shrubs, lay forest bare;
 gnash tusks, fire eye-balls roll,
 till wide wound lets mighty soul.
 around heads whistling javelins sung,
 sounding strokes brazen targets rung;
 fierce fight, yet grecian powers
 maintain’d walls, mann’d lofty towers:
 save fleet last efforts try,
 stones darts mingled tempests fly.
 
sharp boreas blows abroad, brings
 dreary winter frozen wings;
 beneath low-hung clouds sheets snow
 descend, whiten fields below:
 fast darts either army pour,
 rampires rolls rocky shower:
 heavy, thick, resound batter’d shields,
 deaf echo rattles round fields.
 
shame repulsed, grief fury driven,
 frantic asius thus accuses heaven:
 “in powers immortal shall now believe?

 bold hector polydamas, pursue;
 fierce impatience works fall,

 mad smart, drops fatal prey,
 airy circles wings painful way,
 floats winds, rends heaven cries:
 amidst host fallen serpent lies.

 first polydamas silence broke,

“how oft, brother, thy reproach bear,

 thus mind explains clear event:
 victor eagle, whose sinister flight
 retards host, fills hearts fright,
 dismiss’d conquest middle skies,
 allow’d seize, possess prize;
 thus, though gird fires grecian fleet,
 though proud bulwalks tumble feet,
 toils unforeseen, fiercer, decreed;
 woes shall follow, heroes bleed.
 bodes soul, bids thus advise;
 thus skilful seer read skies.”
 
hector disdain return’d:
 (fierce spoke, eyes fury burn’d:)
 “are faithful counsels thy tongue?
 thy will partial, thy reason wrong:
 purpose thy heart thou vent,
 sure heaven resumes little sense lent.
 coward counsels thy madness move
 word, will reveal’d jove?
 leading sign, irrevocable nod,
 happy thunders favouring god,
 shall slight, guide wavering mind
 wandering birds flit every wind?
 ye vagrants sky! wings extend,
 suns arise, descend;
 right, left, unheeded take way,

 without sign sword brave man draws,
 asks omen country’s cause.
 should’st thou suspect war’s success?
 none fears more, none promotes less:
 though chiefs amidst yon ships expire,
 trust thy cowardice escape fire.
 troy sons may find general grave,
 thou canst live, thou canst slave.
 yet fears wary mind suggests
 spread cold poison soldiers’ breasts,
 javelin can revenge base part,
 free soul quivers thy heart.”
 
furious spoke, and, rushing wall,
 calls host; host obey call;
 ardour follow leader flies:
 redoubling clamours thunder skies.
 jove breathes whirlwind hills ide,
 drifts dust clouded navy hide;
 fills greeks terror dismay,
 gives great hector predestined day.

 upheaved piles prop solid wall;
 heaps heaps smoky ruins fall.
 greece ramparts stands fierce alarms;
 crowded bulwarks blaze waving arms,
 shield touching shield, long refulgent row;
 whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.
 bold ajaces fly tower tower,

 generous impulse every greek obeys;
 threats urge fearful; valiant, praise.
 
“fellows arms! whose deeds known fame,
 you, whose ardour hopes equal name!
 since alike endued force art;
 behold day may act part!
 day fire brave, warm cold,

ardour kindles grecian powers;
 now stones descend heavier showers.
 high jove sharp artillery forms,
 opes cloudy magazine storms;
 winter’s bleak uncomfortable reign,
 snowy inundation hides plain;
 stills winds, bids skies sleep;
 pours silent tempest thick deep;

 green fields, sandy shore;
 bent weight, nodding woods seen,
 one bright waste hides works men:
 circling seas, alone absorbing all,
 drink dissolving fleeces fall:
 side increased stony rain,
 white ruin rises o’er plain.
 
thus godlike hector troops contend
 force ramparts, gates rend:

 till great sarpedon tower’d amid field;
 mighty jove inspired martial flame
 matchless son, urged fame.
 arms shines, conspicuous afar,
 bears aloft ample shield air;
 within whose orb thick bull-hides roll’d,
 ponderous brass, bound ductile gold:
 two pointed javelins arm hands,
 majestic moves along, leads lycian bands.

 sullen majesty, stern disdain:
 vain loud mastiffs bay afar,
 shepherds gall iron war;
 regardless, furious, pursues way;
 foams, roars, rends panting prey.
 
resolved alike, divine sarpedon glows
 generous rage drives foes.
 views towers, meditates fall,
 sure destruction dooms aspiring wall;
 casting friend ardent look,
 fired thirst glory, thus spoke:
 
“why boast we, glaucus! extended reign,[226]
 xanthus’ streams enrich lycian plain,
 numerous herds range fruitful field,
 hills vines purple harvest yield,
 foaming bowls purer nectar crown’d,
 feasts enhanced music’s sprightly sound?
 shores joy survey’d,
 admired heroes, gods obey’d,
 unless great acts superior merit prove,
 vindicate bounteous powers above?
 ’tis ours, dignity give grace;
 first valour, first place;
 wondering eyes martial bands
 behold deeds transcending commands,
 such, may cry, deserve sovereign state,
 envy dare imitate!
 care elude gloomy grave,
 claims less fearful brave,
 lust fame vainly dare
 fighting fields, urge thy soul war.
 since, alas! ignoble age must come,
 disease, death’s inexorable doom,
 life, others pay, let us bestow,
 give fame nature owe;
 brave though fall, honour’d live,
 let us glory gain, glory give!”
 
said; words listening chief inspire
 equal warmth, rouse warrior’s fire;
 troops pursue leaders delight,
 rush foe, claim promised fight.
 menestheus high storm beheld
 threatening fort, blackening field:

 war renews, mix’d shouts groans arise;
 tumultuous clamour mounts, thickens skies.
 fierce ajax first advancing host invades,

 sinks warrior thundering sound,
 brazen armour rings ground.
 
swift battlement victor flies,
 tugs full force, every nerve applies:
 shakes; ponderous stones disjointed yield;
 rolling ruins smoke along field.
 mighty breach appears; walls lie bare;
 and, like deluge, rushes war.

 “o where, ye lycians, strength boast?

just rebuke inflamed lycian crew;

 folds shatter’d; crackling door
 leap resounding bars, flying hinges roar.
 now rushing in, furious chief appears,
 gloomy night![228] shakes two shining spears:
 dreadful gleam bright armour came,
 eye-balls flash’d living flame.

 fix’d great hector conquering host,

 toil struggle well-fought day.
 turn’d thracia field fight
 eyes shed insufferable light,
 mysians prove martial force,
 hardy thracians tame savage horse;
 far-famed hippomolgian strays,
 renown’d justice length days;[229]
 thrice happy race! that, innocent blood,

 observed thunderer, observed vain.
 samothracia, mountain’s brow,
 whose waving woods o’erhung deeps below,
 sat; round cast azure eyes
 ida’s misty tops confusedly rise;
 below, fair ilion’s glittering spires seen;
 crowded ships sable seas between.
 there, crystal chambers main
 emerged, sat, mourn’d argives slain.
 jove incensed, grief fury stung,
 prone rocky steep rush’d along;
 fierce pass’d, lofty mountains nod,

 refulgent arms mighty limbs infold,
 immortal arms adamant gold.

“’tis yours, warriors, hopes raise:
 oh recollect ancient worth praise!
 ’tis save us, cease fear;
 flight, shameful, destructive here.
 works though troy fury fall,
 pour armies o’er batter’d wall:
 greece strength: this, part o’erthrown,
 strength vain; dread alone:
 hector rages like force fire,
 vaunts gods, calls high jove sire:
 yet heavenly power breast excite,
 breathe hearts, string arms fight,
 greece yet may live, threaten’d fleet maintain:
 hector’s force, jove’s aid, vain.”
 
sceptre, deep controls,
 touch’d chiefs, steel’d manly souls:
 strength, own, touch divine imparts,
 prompts light limbs, swells daring hearts.
 then, falcon rocky height,
 quarry seen, impetuous sight,
 forth-springing instant, darts high,
 shoots wing, skims along sky:
 such, swift, power ocean flew;
 wide horizon shut view.
 
inspiring god oïleus’ active son
 perceived first, thus telamon:
 
“some god, friend, god human form
 favouring descends, wills stand storm.
 calchas this, venerable seer;
 short turned, saw power appear:
 mark’d parting, steps trod;
 bright evidence reveals god.
 even now energy divine share,
 seem walk wings, tread air!”
 
“with equal ardour (telamon returns)
 soul kindled, bosom burns;
 new rising spirits force alarm,
 lift impatient limb, brace arm.
 ready arm, unthinking, shakes dart;
 blood pours back, fortifies heart:
 singly, methinks, yon towering chief meet,
 stretch dreadful hector feet.”
 
full god urged burning breast,
 heroes thus mutual warmth express’d.
 neptune meanwhile routed greeks inspired;
 who, breathless, pale, length labours tired,
 pant ships; troy conquest calls,
 swarms victorious o’er yielding walls:
 trembling impending storm lie,
 tears rage stand burning eye.
 greece sunk thought, fatal hour;
 breathe new courage feel power.
 teucer leitus first words excite;
 stern peneleus rises fight;
 thoas, deipyrus, arms renown’d,
 merion next, impulsive fury found;
 last nestor’s bold ardour takes,
 thus god martial fire awakes:
 
“oh lasting infamy, oh dire disgrace
 chiefs vigorous youth, manly race!
 trusted gods, you, see
 brave greece victorious, navy free:
 ah, no—the glorious combat disclaim,
 one black day clouds former fame.
 heavens! prodigy eyes survey,
 unseen, unthought, till amazing day!
 fly length troy’s oft-conquer’d bands?
 falls fleet inglorious hands?
 rout undisciplined, straggling train,
 born glories dusty plain;
 like frighted fawns hill hill pursued,
 prey every savage wood:
 shall these, late trembled name,
 invade camps, involve ships flame?
 change shameful, say, cause wrought?
 soldiers’ baseness, general’s fault?
 fools! will ye perish leader’s vice;
 purchase infamy, life price?
 ’tis cause, achilles’ injured fame:
 another’s crime, shame.
 grant chief offend rage lust,
 must cowards, king’s unjust?
 prevent evil, country save:
 small thought retrieves spirits brave.
 think, subdue! dastards dead fame
 waste anger, feel shame:
 you, pride, flower host,
 heart weeps blood see glory lost!
 deem day, battle, lose;
 day black, fate vile, ensues.
 let reflect, prizes fame breath,
 endless infamy, instant death:
 for, lo! fated time, appointed shore:
 hark! gates burst, brazen barriers roar!
 impetuous hector thunders wall;
 hour, spot, conquer, fall.”
 
words grecians’ fainting hearts inspire,
 listening armies catch godlike fire.
 fix’d post bold ajax found,
 well-ranged squadrons strongly circled round:
 close order, disposed fight,
 pallas’ self might view fix’d delight;
 god war inclined eyes,
 god war own’d just surprise.
 chosen phalanx, firm, resolved fate,
 descending hector battle wait.
 iron scene gleams dreadful o’er fields,
 armour armour lock’d, shields shields,
 spears lean spears, targets targets throng,
 helms stuck helms, man drove man along.
 floating plumes unnumber’d wave above,
 earthquake stirs nodding grove;
 levell’d skies pointing rays,
 brandish’d lances motion blaze.
 
thus breathing death, terrible array,
 close compacted legions urged way:
 fierce drove on, impatient destroy;
 troy charged first, hector first troy.
 mountain’s craggy forehead torn,
 rock’s round fragment flies, fury borne,
 (which stubborn stone torrent rends,)
 precipitate ponderous mass descends:
 steep steep rolling ruin bounds;
 every shock crackling wood resounds;
 still gathering force, smokes; urged amain,
 whirls, leaps, thunders down, impetuous plain:
 stops—so hector. whole force proved,[230]
 resistless raged, and, stopp’d, unmoved.
 
war bent, darts shed,
 falchions wave around head:
 repulsed stands, stand retires;
 repeated shouts army fires.
 “trojans! firm; arm shall make way
 yon square body, black array:
 stand, spear shall rout scattering power,
 strong seem, embattled like tower;
 juno’s heavenly bosom warms,
 first gods, day inspires arms.”
 
said; roused soul every breast:
 urged desire fame, beyond rest,
 forth march’d deiphobus; but, marching, held
 wary steps ample shield.
 bold merion aim’d stroke (nor aim’d wide);
 glittering javelin pierced tough bull-hide;
 pierced through: unfaithful hand,
 point broke short, sparkled sand.
 trojan warrior, touch’d timely fear,
 raised orb distance bore spear.
 greek, retreating, mourn’d frustrate blow,
 cursed treacherous lance spared foe;
 ships surly speed went,
 seek surer javelin tent.
 
meanwhile rising rage battle glows,
 tumult thickens, clamour grows.
 teucer’s arm warlike imbrius bleeds,
 mentor, rich generous steeds.
 ere yet troy sons greece led,
 fair pedaeus’ verdant pastures bred,
 youth dwelt, remote war’s alarms,
 blest bright medesicaste’s arms:
 (this nymph, fruit priam’s ravish’d joy,
 allied warrior house troy:)
 troy, glory call’d arms, came,
 match’d bravest chiefs fame:
 priam’s sons, guardian throne,
 lived, beloved honour’d own.
 teucer pierced throat ear:
 groans beneath telamonian spear.
 far-seen mountain’s airy crown,
 subdued steel, tall ash tumbles down,
 soils verdant tresses ground;
 falls youth; arms fall resound.
 teucer rushing despoil dead,
 hector’s hand shining javelin fled:
 saw, shunn’d death; forceful dart
 sung on, pierced amphimachus’s heart,
 cteatus’ son, neptune’s forceful line;
 vain courage, race divine!
 prostrate falls; clanging arms resound,
 broad buckler thunders ground.
 seize beamy helm victor flies,
 just fastened dazzling prize,
 ajax’ manly arm javelin flung;
 full shield’s round boss weapon rung;
 felt shock, doom’d feel,
 secure mail, sheath’d shining steel.
 repulsed yields; victor greeks obtain
 spoils contested, bear slain.
 leaders athenian line,
 (stichius brave, menestheus divine,)
 deplored amphimachus, sad object! lies;
 imbrius remains fierce ajaces’ prize.
 two grim lions bear across lawn,
 snatch’d devouring hounds, slaughter’d fawn.
 fell jaws high-lifting wood,
 sprinkling shrubs drops blood;
 these, chief: great ajax dead
 strips bright arms; oïleus lops head:
 toss’d like ball, whirl’d air away,
 hector’s feet gory visage lay.
 
god ocean, fired stern disdain,
 pierced sorrow grandson slain,
 inspires grecian hearts, confirms hands,
 breathes destruction trojan bands.
 swift whirlwind rushing fleet,
 finds lance-famed idomen crete,
 pensive brow generous care express’d
 wounded soldier touch’d breast,
 chance war javelin tore,
 sad comrades battle bore;
 surgeons camp sent:
 office paid, issued tent
 fierce fight: god begun,
 thoas’ voice, andræmon’s valiant son,
 ruled calydon’s white rocks arise,
 pleuron’s chalky cliffs emblaze skies:
 
“where’s now imperious vaunt, daring boast,
 greece victorious, proud ilion lost?”
 
king: “on greece blame thrown;
 arms trade, war own.
 hardy heroes well-fought plains
 fear withholds, shameful sloth detains:
 ’tis heaven, alas! jove’s all-powerful doom,
 far, far distant native home
 wills us fall inglorious! oh, friend!
 foremost fight, still prone lend
 arms counsels, now perform thy best,
 thou canst singly, urge rest.”
 
thus he: thus god whose force can make
 solid globe’s eternal basis shake:
 “ah! never may see native land,
 feed vultures hateful strand,
 seeks ignobly ships stay,
 dares combat signal day!
 this, behold! horrid arms shine,
 urge thy soul rival acts mine.
 together let us battle plain;
 two, worst; even succour vain:
 vain weakest, force unite;
 ours, bravest confess’d fight.”
 
said, rushes combat burns;
 swift tent cretan king returns:
 thence, two javelins glittering hand,
 clad arms lighten’d strand,
 fierce foe impetuous hero drove,
 like lightning bursting arm jove,
 pale man wrath heaven declares,
 terrifies offending world wars;
 streamy sparkles, kindling skies,
 pole pole trail glory flies:
 thus bright armour o’er dazzled throng
 gleam’d dreadful, monarch flash’d along.
 
him, near tent, meriones attends;
 thus questions: “ever best friends!
 say, every art battle skill’d,
 holds thy courage brave field?
 important message art thou bound,
 bleeds friend unhappy wound?
 inglorious here, soul abhors stay,
 glows prospects th’ approaching day.”
 
“o prince! (meriones replies) whose care
 leads forth embattled sons crete war;
 speaks grief: headless lance wield;
 rest lies rooted trojan shield.”
 
cretan: “enter, receive
 wonted weapons; tent can give;
 spears store, (and trojan lances all,)
 shed lustre round illumined wall,
 though i, disdainful distant war,
 trust dart, aim uncertain spear,
 yet hand hand fight, spoil slain;
 thence trophies, arms gain.
 enter, see heaps helmets roll’d,
 high-hung spears, shields flame gold.”
 
“nor vain (said merion) martial toils;
 can boast ignoble spoils:
 ship contains; whence distant far,
 fight conspicuous war,
 need more? greek be
 knows merion, appeal thee.”
 
this, idomeneus: “the fields fight
 proved thy valour, unconquer’d might:
 ambush foes design’d,
 even thy courage lag behind:
 sharp service, singled rest,
 fear each, valour, stands confess’d.
 force, firmness, pale coward shows;
 shifts place: colour comes goes:
 dropping sweat creeps cold every part;
 bosom beats quivering heart;
 terror death wild eye-balls stare;
 chattering teeth stands, stiffening hair,
 looks bloodless image despair!
 brave—still dauntless, still same,
 unchanged colour, unmoved frame:
 composed thought, determined eye,
 fix’d soul, conquer die:
 aught disturb tenour breast,
 ’tis wish strike rest.
 
“in assays thy blameless worth known,
 every art dangerous war thy own.
 chance fight whatever wounds bore,
 wounds glorious all, before;
 may teach, ’twas still thy brave delight
 t’oppose thy bosom thy foremost fight.
 why, like infants, cold honour’s charms,
 stand talk, glory calls arms?
 go—from conquer’d spears choicest take,
 owners send nobly back.”
 
swift word bold merion snatch’d spear
 and, breathing slaughter, follow’d war.
 mars armipotent invades plain,
 (the wide destroyer race man,)
 terror, best-beloved son, attends course,
 arm’d stern boldness, enormous force;
 pride haughty warriors confound,
 lay strength tyrants ground:
 thrace fly, call’d dire alarms
 warring phlegyans, ephyrian arms;
 invoked both, relentless dispose,
 glad conquest, murderous rout those.
 march’d leaders cretan train,
 bright arms shot horror o’er plain.
 
first spake merion: “shall join right,
 combat centre fight?
 left wonted succour lend?
 hazard fame parts alike attend.”
 
“not centre (idomen replied:)
 ablest chieftains main battle guide;
 godlike ajax makes post care,
 gallant teucer deals destruction there,
 skill’d shafts gall distant field,
 bear close battle sounding shield.
 can rage haughty hector tame:
 safe arms, navy fears flame,
 till jove descends, bolts shed,
 hurl blazing ruin head.
 great must be, human birth,
 feed like mortals fruits earth.
 neither rocks can crush, steel can wound,
 ajax fells ensanguined ground.
 standing fight mates achilles’ force,
 excell’d alone swiftness course.
 left ready arms apply,
 live glory, glory die.”
 
said: merion th’ appointed place,
 fierce god battles, urged pace.
 soon foe shining chiefs beheld
 rush like fiery torrent o’er field,
 force embodied tide pour;
 rising combat sounds along shore.
 warring winds, sirius’ sultry reign,
 different quarters sweep sandy plain;
 every side dusty whirlwinds rise,
 dry fields lifted skies:
 thus despair, hope, rage, together driven,
 met black hosts, and, meeting, darken’d heaven.
 dreadful glared iron face war,
 bristled upright spears, flash’d afar;
 dire gleam breastplates, helms, shields,
 polish’d arms emblazed flaming fields:
 tremendous scene! general horror gave,
 touch’d joy bosoms brave.
 
saturn’s great sons fierce contention vied,
 crowds heroes anger died.
 sire earth heaven, thetis won
 crown glory peleus’ godlike son,
 will’d destruction grecian powers,
 spared awhile destined trojan towers;
 neptune, rising azure main,
 warr’d king heaven stern disdain,
 breathed revenge, fired grecian train.
 gods one source, one ethereal race,
 alike divine, heaven native place;
 jove greater; first-born skies,
 men, gods, supremely wise.
 this, jove’s superior might afraid,
 neptune human form conceal’d aid.
 powers enfold greek trojan train
 war discord’s adamantine chain,
 indissolubly strong: fatal tie
 stretch’d both, close compell’d die.
 
dreadful arms, grown combats grey,
 bold idomeneus controls day.
 first hand othryoneus slain,
 swell’d false hopes, mad ambition vain;
 call’d voice war martial fame,
 high cabesus’ distant walls came;
 cassandra’s love sought, boasts power,
 promised conquest proffer’d dower.
 king consented, vaunts abused;
 king consented, fates refused.
 proud himself, imagined bride,
 field measured larger stride.
 stalk’d, cretan javelin found;
 vain breastplate repel wound:
 dream glory lost, plunged hell;
 arms resounded boaster fell.
 great idomeneus bestrides dead;
 “and thus (he cries) behold thy promise sped!
 help thy arms ilion bring,
 contract phrygian king!
 offers now, illustrious prince! receive;
 aid will argos give?
 conquer troy, thy forces join,
 count atrides’ fairest daughter thine.
 meantime, methods advise,
 come, follow fleet thy new allies;
 hear greece part say.”
 spoke, dragg’d gory corse away.
 asius view’d, unable contain,
 chariot warring plain:
 (his crowded coursers, squire consign’d,
 impatient panted neck behind:)
 vengeance rising sudden spring,
 hoped conquest cretan king.
 wary cretan, foe drew near,
 full throat discharged forceful spear:
 beneath chin point seen glide,
 glitter’d, extant side.
 mountain-oak, poplar tall,
 pine, fit mast great admiral,
 groans oft-heaved axe, many wound,
 spreads length ruin o’er ground:
 sunk proud asius dreadful day,
 stretch’d much-loved coursers lay.
 grinds dust distain’d streaming gore,
 and, fierce death, lies foaming shore.
 deprived motion, stiff stupid fear,
 stands aghast trembling charioteer,
 shuns foe, turns steeds away,
 falls transfix’d, unresisting prey:
 pierced antilochus, pants beneath
 stately car, labours breath.
 thus asius’ steeds (their mighty master gone)
 remain prize nestor’s youthful son.
 
stabb’d sight, deiphobus drew nigh,
 made, force, vengeful weapon fly.
 cretan saw; and, stooping, caused glance
 slope shield disappointed lance.
 beneath spacious targe, (a blazing round,
 thick bull-hides brazen orbits bound,
 raised arm two strong braces stay’d,)
 lay collected defensive shade.
 o’er safe head javelin idly sung,
 tinkling verge faintly rung.
 even spear vigorous arm confess’d,
 pierced, obliquely, king hypsenor’s breast:
 warm’d liver, ground bore
 chief, people’s guardian now more!
 
“not unattended (the proud trojan cries)
 unrevenged, lamented asius lies:
 thee, hell’s black portals stand display’d,
 mate shall joy thy melancholy shade.”
 
heart-piercing anguish, haughty boast,
 touch’d every greek, nestor’s most.
 grieved was, pious arms attend,
 broad buckler shields slaughter’d friend:
 till sad mecistheus alastor bore
 honour’d body tented shore.
 
yet fight idomeneus withdraws;
 resolved perish country’s cause,
 find foe, heaven shall doom
 wail fate death’s eternal gloom.

 spouse hippodame, divinely fair,
 anchises’ eldest hope, darling care:
 charm’d parents’ husband’s heart
 beauty, sense, every work art:

 fairest fair troy.
 neptune now hapless hero dies,
 covers cloud beauteous eyes,
 fetters every limb: yet bent meet
 fate stands; shuns lance crete.
 fix’d column, deep-rooted oak,
 winds sleep; breast received stroke.
 ponderous stroke corslet yields,
 long used ward death fighting fields.
 riven armour sends jarring sound;
 labouring heart heaves strong bound,
 long lance shakes, vibrates wound;
 fast flowing source, prone lay,
 life’s purple tide impetuous gush’d away.
 
idomen, insulting o’er slain:
 “behold, deiphobus! vaunt vain:
 see! one greek three trojan ghosts attend;
 this, third victim, shades send.
 approaching now thy boasted might approve,
 try prowess seed jove.
 jove, enamour’d mortal dame,
 great minos, guardian country, came:
 deucalion, blameless prince, minos’ heir;
 first-born i, third jupiter:
 o’er spacious crete, bold sons, reign,
 thence ships transport main:
 lord host, o’er host shine,
 scourge thee, thy father, thy line.”
 
trojan heard; uncertain meet,
 alone, venturous arms king crete,
 seek auxiliar force; length decreed
 call hero partake deed,
 forthwith Æneas rises thought:
 troy’s remotest lines sought,
 he, incensed partial priam, stands,
 sees superior posts meaner hands.
 him, ambitious great aid,
 bold deiphobus approach’d, said:
 
“now, trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,
 e’er thy bosom felt fair honour’s charms.
 alcathous dies, thy brother thy friend;
 come, warrior’s loved remains defend.
 beneath cares thy early youth train’d,
 one table fed you, one roof contain’d.
 deed fierce idomeneus owe;
 haste, revenge th’ insulting foe.”
 
Æneas heard, space resign’d
 tender pity manly mind;
 rising rage, burns fight:
 greek awaits collected might.
 fell boar, rough mountain’s head,
 arm’d wild terrors, slaughter bred,
 loud rustics rise, shout far,
 attends tumult, expects war;
 o’er bent back bristly horrors rise;
 fires stream lightning sanguine eyes,
 foaming tusks dogs men engage;
 hunters rouse mighty rage:
 stood idomeneus, javelin shook,
 met trojan lowering look.
 antilochus, deipyrus, near,
 youthful offspring god war,
 merion, aphareus, field renown’d:
 warrior sent voice around.
 “fellows arms! timely aid unite;
 lo, great Æneas rushes fight:
 sprung god, mortal bold;
 fresh youth, arms grown old.
 else hand, hour decide strife,
 great dispute, glory, life.”
 
spoke, all, one soul, obey’d;
 lifted bucklers cast dreadful shade
 around chief. Æneas demands
 th’ assisting forces native bands;
 paris, deiphobus, agenor, join;
 (co-aids captains trojan line;)
 order follow th’ embodied train,
 like ida’s flocks proceeding o’er plain;
 fleecy care, erect bold,
 stalks proud ram, father bold.
 joy swain surveys them, leads
 cool fountains, well-known meads:
 joys Æneas, native band
 moves rank, stretches o’er land.
 
round dread alcathous now battle rose;
 every side steely circle grows;
 now batter’d breast-plates hack’d helmets ring,
 o’er heads unheeded javelins sing.
 rest, two towering chiefs appear,
 great idomeneus, Æneas here.
 like gods war, dispensing fate, stood,
 burn’d drench ground mutual blood.
 trojan weapon whizz’d along air;
 cretan saw, shunn’d brazen spear:
 sent arm strong, missive wood
 stuck deep earth, quiver’d stood.
 oenomas received cretan’s stroke;
 forceful spear hollow corslet broke,
 ripp’d belly ghastly wound,
 roll’d smoking entrails ground.
 stretch’d plain, sobs away breath,
 and, furious, grasps bloody dust death.
 victor breast weapon tears;
 spoils not, shower spears.
 though now unfit active war wage,
 heavy cumbrous arms, stiff cold age,
 listless limbs unable course,
 standing fight yet maintains force;
 till faint labour, foes repell’d,
 tired slow steps drags field.
 deiphobus beheld pass’d,
 and, fired hate, parting javelin cast:
 javelin err’d, held course along,
 pierced ascalaphus, brave young:
 mars fell gasping ground,
 gnash’d dust, bloody wound.
 
knew furious father fall;
 high-throned amidst great olympian hall,
 golden clouds th’ immortal synod sate;
 detain’d bloody war jove fate.
 
now, dust breathless hero lay,
 slain ascalaphus commenced fray,
 deiphobus seize helmet flies,
 temples rends glittering prize;
 valiant mars, meriones drew near,
 loaded arm discharged spear:
 drops weight, disabled pain;
 hollow helmet rings plain.
 swift vulture leaping prey,
 torn arm grecian rent away
 reeking javelin, rejoin’d friends.
 wounded brother good polites tends;
 around waist pious arms threw,
 rage battle gently drew:
 swift coursers, splendid car,
 rapt lessening thunder war;
 troy drove him, groaning shore,
 sprinkling, pass’d, sands gore.
 
meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes sanguine ground,
 heaps fall heaps, heaven earth resound.
 bold aphareus great Æneas bled;
 toward chief turn’d daring head,
 pierced throat; bending head, depress’d
 beneath helmet, nods upon breast;
 shield reversed o’er fallen warrior lies,
 everlasting slumber seals eyes.
 antilochus, thoon turn’d round,
 transpierced back dishonest wound:
 hollow vein, neck extends
 along chine, eager javelin rends:
 supine falls, social train
 spreads imploring arms, spreads vain.
 thv exulting victor, leaping lay,
 broad shoulders tore spoils away;
 time observed; closed foes around,
 sides thick peals arms resound.
 shield emboss’d ringing storm sustains,
 impervious untouch’d remains.
 (great neptune’s care preserved hostile rage
 youth, joy nestor’s glorious age.)
 arms intrepid, first fought,
 faced every foe, every danger sought;
 winged lance, resistless wind,
 obeys motion master’s mind!
 restless flies, impatient free,
 meditates distant enemy.
 asius, adamas, drew near,
 struck target brazen spear
 fierce front: neptune wards blow,
 blunts javelin th’ eluded foe:
 broad buckler half weapon stood,
 splinter’d earth flew half broken wood.
 disarm’d, mingled trojan crew;
 merion’s spear o’ertook flew,
 deep belly’s rim entrance found,
 sharp pang, mortal wound.
 bending fell, doubled ground,
 lay panting. thus ox fetters tied,
 death’s strong pangs distend labouring side,
 bulk enormous field displays;
 heaving heart beats thick ebbing life decays.
 spear conqueror body drew,
 death’s dim shadows swarm view.
 next brave deipyrus dust laid:
 king helenus waved high thracian blade,
 smote temples arm strong,
 helm fell off, roll’d amid throng:
 luckier greek rests prize;
 dark death godlike owner lies!
 raging grief, great menelaus burns,
 fraught vengeance, victor turns:
 shook ponderous lance, act throw;
 stood adverse bended bow:
 full breast trojan arrow fell,
 harmless bounded plated steel.
 ample barn’s well harden’d floor,
 (the winds collected open door,)
 broad fan force whirl’d around,
 light leaps golden grain, resulting ground:
 steel guards atrides’ heart,
 repell’d distance flies bounding dart.
 atrides, watchful unwary foe,
 pierced lance hand grasp’d bow.
 nailed yew: wounded hand
 trail’d long lance mark’d blood sand:
 good agenor gently wound
 spear solicits, bandage bound;
 sling’s soft wool, snatch’d soldier’s side,
 tent ligature supplied.
 
behold! pisander, urged fate’s decree,
 springs ranks fall, fall thee,
 great menelaus! enchance thy fame:
 high-towering front, warrior came.
 first sharp lance atrides thrown;
 lance far distant winds blown.
 pierced pisander atrides’ shield:
 pisander’s spear fell shiver’d field.
 discouraged, future blind,
 vain dreams conquest swell haughty mind;
 dauntless rushes spartan lord
 like lightning brandish’d far beaming sword.
 left arm high opposed shining shield:
 right beneath, cover’d pole-axe held;
 (an olive’s cloudy grain handle made,
 distinct studs, brazen blade;)
 helm discharged noble blow;
 plume dropp’d nodding plain below,
 shorn crest. atrides waved steel:
 deep front weighty falchion fell;
 crashing bones force gave way;
 dust blood groaning hero lay:
 forced ghastly orbs, spouting gore,
 clotted eye-balls tumble shore.
 fierce atrides spurn’d bled,
 tore arms, and, loud-exulting, said:
 
“thus, trojans, thus, length taught fear;
 race perfidious, delight war!
 already noble deeds ye perform’d;
 princess raped transcends navy storm’d:
 bold feats impious might approve,
 without th’ assistance, fear jove.
 violated rites, ravish’d dame;
 heroes slaughter’d ships flame,
 crimes heap’d crimes, shall bend glory down,
 whelm ruins yon flagitious town.
 thou, great father! lord earth skies,
 thought man, supremely wise!
 thy hand fates mortals flow,
 whence favour impious foe?
 godless crew, abandon’d unjust,
 still breathing rapine, violence, lust?
 best things, beyond measure, cloy;
 sleep’s balmy blessing, love’s endearing joy;
 feast, dance; whate’er mankind desire,
 even sweet charms sacred numbers tire.
 troy ever reaps dire delight
 thirst slaughter, lust fight.”
 
said, seized (while yet carcase heaved)
 bloody armour, train received:
 sudden mix’d among warring crew,
 bold pylæmenes slew.
 harpalion asia travell’d far,
 following martial father war:
 filial love left native shore,
 never, ah, never behold more!
 unsuccessful spear chanced fling
 target spartan king;

 whole nations fear’d; argive shook.
 towering ajax, ample stride,
 advanced first, thus chief defied:
 
“hector! come on; thy empty threats forbear;
 ’tis thy arm, ’tis thundering jove fear:
 skill war us idly given,
 lo! greece humbled, troy, heaven.
 vain hopes haughty mind imparts,
 force fleet: greeks hands hearts.
 long ere flames lofty navy fall,
 boasted city, god-built wall,
 shall sink beneath us, smoking ground;
 spread long unmeasured ruin round.
 time shall come, when, chased along plain,
 even thou shalt call jove, call vain;
 even thou shalt wish, aid thy desperate course,
 wings falcons thy flying horse;
 shalt run, forgetful warrior’s fame,
 clouds friendly dust conceal thy shame.”
 
thus spoke, behold, open view,
 sounding wings dexter eagle flew.
 jove’s glad omen grecians rise,
 hail, shouts, progress skies:
 far-echoing clamours bound side side;
 ceased; thus chief troy replied:
 
“from whence menace, insulting strain?
 enormous boaster! doom’d vaunt vain.
 may gods hector life bestow,
 (not short life mortals lead below,
 jove’s high lineage born,
 blue-eyed maid, gilds morn,)
 decisive day shall end fame
 greece, argos name.
 thou, imperious! thy madness wait
 lance hector, thou shalt meet thy fate:
 giant-corse, extended shore,
 shall largely feast fowls fat gore.”
 
said; like lion stalk’d along:
 shouts incessant earth ocean rung,
 sent following host: grecian train
 answering thunders fill’d echoing plain;
 shout tore heaven’s concave, and, above,
 shook fix’d splendours throne jove.

juno deceives jupiter girdle venus.
 

nestor, sitting table machaon, alarmed the
 increasing clamour war, hastens agamemnon; way he
 meets prince diomed ulysses, informs the
 extremity danger. agamemnon proposes make escape by
 night, ulysses withstands; diomed adds advice, that,
 wounded were, go forth encourage army with
 presence, advice pursued. juno, seeing partiality of
 jupiter trojans, forms design over-reach him: sets off
 charms utmost care, (the surely enchant him)
 obtains magic girdle venus. applies god
 sleep, and, difficulty, persuades seal eyes of
 jupiter: done, goes mount ida, god, first
 sight, ravished beauty, sinks embraces, laid
 asleep. neptune takes advantage slumber, succours the
 greeks: hector struck ground prodigious stone ajax,
 carried battle: several actions succeed, till the
 trojans, much distressed, obliged give way: lesser ajax
 signalizes particular manner.
 

genial feast, flowing bowl,
 charm cares nestor’s watchful soul;
 startled ears increasing cries attend;
 thus, impatient, wounded friend:
 
“what new alarm, divine machaon, say,
 mix’d events attend mighty day?
 hark! shouts divide, meet,
 now come full, thicken fleet!
 cordial draught dispel thy care,
 let hecamede strengthening bath prepare,
 refresh thy wound, cleanse clotted gore;
 adventures day explore.”
 
said: and, seizing thrasymedes’ shield,
 (his valiant offspring,) hasten’d field;
 (that day father’s buckler bore;)
 snatch’d lance, issued door.
 soon prospect open’d view,
 wounded eyes scene sorrow knew;
 dire disarray! tumult fight,

 old ocean’s silent surface sleeps,

 yet expected tempest hangs high,

 mass waters will wind obey;
 jove sends one gust, bids roll away.
 wavering counsels thus mind engage,
 fluctuates doubtful thought pylian sage,

 nestor’s approach alarm’d grecian breast,
 thus general host address’d:
 
“o grace glory achaian name;

thus he. sage ulysses thus replies,

 “what shameful words (unkingly thou art)

 oh thy sway curse meaner powers,

 fierce foe launch’d piercing steel;
 foe, reclining, shunn’d flying death;
 fate, archilochus, demands thy breath:
 thy lofty birth succour impart,
 wings death o’ertook thee dart;
 swift perform heaven’s fatal will, fled
 full juncture neck head,
 took joint, cut nerves twain:
 dropping head first tumbled plain.
 just stroke, yet body stood
 erect, roll’d along sands blood.
 
“here, proud polydamas, turn thy eyes!
 (the towering ajax loud-insulting cries:)
 say, chief extended plain
 worthy vengeance prothoënor slain?
 mark well port! figure face
 speak vulgar, vulgar race;
 lines, methinks, may make lineage known,
 antenor’s brother, perhaps son.”
 
spake, smiled severe, well knew
 bleeding youth: troy sadden’d view.
 furious acamas avenged cause;
 promachus slaughtered brother draws,
 pierced heart—“such fate attends all,
 proud argives! destined arms fall.
 troy alone, haughty greece, shall share
 toils, sorrows, wounds war.
 behold promachus deprived breath,
 victim owed brave brother’s death.
 unappeased enters pluto’s gate,
 leaves brother revenge fate.”
 
heart-piercing anguish struck grecian host,
 touch’d breast bold peneleus most;
 proud boaster directs course;
 boaster flies, shuns superior force.
 young ilioneus received spear;
 ilioneus, father’s care:
 (phorbas rich, trojan train
 hermes loved, taught arts gain:)
 full eye weapon chanced fall,
 fibres scoop’d rooted ball,
 drove neck, hurl’d plain;
 lifts miserable arms vain!
 swift broad falchion fierce peneleus spread,
 spouting shoulders struck head;
 earth head helmet fly;
 lance, yet sticking bleeding eye,
 victor seized; and, aloft shook
 gory visage, thus insulting spoke:
 
“trojans! great ilioneus behold!
 haste, father let tale told:
 let high roofs resound frantic woe,
 house promachus must know;
 let doleful tidings greet mother’s ear,
 promachus’ sad spouse bear,
 victorious shall greece return,
 pale matron triumphs mourn.”
 
dreadful spoke, toss’d head high;
 trojans hear, tremble, fly:
 aghast gaze around fleet wall,
 dread ruin impends all.
 
daughters jove! olympus shine,
 ye all-beholding, all-recording nine!
 say, neptune made proud ilion yield,
 chief, hero first embrued field?
 grecians immortal name,
 whose bless’d trophies, will ye raise fame?
 
thou first, great ajax! unsanguined plain
 laid hyrtius, leader mysian train.
 phalces mermer, nestor’s o’erthrew,
 bold merion, morys hippotion slew.
 strong periphaetes prothoon bled,
 teucer’s arrows mingled dead,
 pierced flank menelaus’ steel,
 people’s pastor, hyperenor fell;
 eternal darkness wrapp’d warrior round,
 fierce soul came rushing wound.
 stretch’d heaps oïleus’ son,
 fall mighty numbers, mighty numbers run;
 ajax less, grecian race
 skill’d pursuit, swiftest chase.

argument.
 

fifth battle ships; acts ajax.
 

jupiter, awaking, sees trojans repulsed trenches, hector
 swoon, neptune head greeks: highly
 incensed artifice juno, appeases submissions;
 sent iris apollo. juno, repairing assembly of
 gods, attempts, extraordinary address, incense against
 jupiter; particular touches mars violent resentment; he
 ready take arms, prevented minerva. iris apollo
 obey orders jupiter; iris commands neptune leave battle,
 which, much reluctance passion, consents. apollo
 reinspires hector vigour, brings back battle, marches
 ægis, turns fortune fight. he
 breaks great part grecian wall: trojans rush in, and
 attempt fire first line fleet, are, yet, repelled
 greater ajax prodigious slaughter.
 

now swift flight pass trench profound,
 many chief lay gasping ground:
 stopp’d panted, chariots lie
 fear cheek, horror eye.
 meanwhile, awaken’d dream love,
 ida’s summit sat imperial jove:
 round wide fields cast careful view,
 saw trojans fly, greeks pursue;
 proud arms, scatter’d o’er plain
 and, ’midst war, monarch main.
 far, great hector dust spies,
 (his sad associates round weeping eyes,)
 ejecting blood, panting yet breath,
 senses wandering verge death.
 god beheld pitying look,
 thus, incensed, fraudful juno spoke:
 
“o thou, still adverse eternal will,
 ever studious promoting ill!
 thy arts made godlike hector yield,
 driven conquering squadrons field.
 canst thou, unhappy thy wiles, withstand
 power immense, brave almighty hand?
 hast thou forgot, when, bound fix’d high,
 vast concave spangled sky,
 hung thee trembling golden chain,
 raging gods opposed vain?
 headlong hurl’d olympian hall,
 stunn’d whirl, breathless fall.
 godlike hercules deeds done,
 seem’d vengeance worthy son:
 when, thy wiles induced, fierce boreas toss’d
 shipwreck’d hero coan coast,
 thousand forms death bore,
 sent argos, native shore.
 hear this, remember, fury dread,
 pull unwilling vengeance thy head;
 lest arts blandishments successless prove,
 thy soft deceits, well-dissembled love.”
 
thunderer spoke: imperial juno mourn’d,
 and, trembling, submissive words return’d:
 
“by every oath powers immortal ties,
 foodful earth all-infolding skies;
 thy black waves, tremendous styx! flow
 drear realms gliding ghosts below;
 dread honours thy sacred head,
 unbroken vow, virgin bed!
 arts ruler main
 steeps troy blood, ranges round plain:
 ardour, pity sway’d,
 help greeks, fought disobey’d:
 else thy juno better counsels given,
 taught submission sire heaven.”
 
“think’st thou me? fair empress skies!
 (the immortal father smile replies;)
 soon haughty sea-god shall obey,
 dare act point way.
 truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim will
 yon bright synod olympian hill;
 high decree let various iris know,
 call god bears silver bow.
 let descend, embattled plain
 command sea-god watery reign:
 phœbus hastes great hector prepare
 rise afresh, wake war:
 labouring bosom re-inspires breath,
 calls senses verge death.
 greece chased troy, even achilles’ fleet,
 shall fall thousands hero’s feet.
 he, untouch’d pity, plain
 shall send patroclus, shall send vain.
 youths slaughters ilion’s walls!
 even loved son, divine sarpedon, falls!
 vanquish’d last hector’s lance lies.
 then, till then, shall great achilles rise:
 lo! instant, godlike hector dies.
 great hour war’s whole fortune turns,
 pallas assists, lofty ilion burns.
 till day shall jove relax rage,
 one heavenly host engage
 aid greece. promise god
 gave, seal’d almighty nod,
 achilles’ glory stars raise;
 word, fate word obeys.”
 
trembling queen (the almighty order given)
 swift idaean summit shot heaven.
 wayfaring man, wanders o’er
 thought length lands trod before,
 sends forth active mind place place,
 joins hill dale, measures space space:
 swift flew juno bless’d abodes,
 thought man can match speed gods.
 sat powers awful synod placed;
 bow’d, made obeisance pass’d
 brazen dome:[239] goblets crown’d
 hail queen; nectar streams around.
 fair themis first presents golden bowl,
 anxious asks cares disturb soul?
 
white-arm’d goddess thus replies:
 “enough thou know’st tyrant skies,
 severely bent purpose fulfil,
 unmoved mind, unrestrain’d will.
 go thou, feasts heaven attend thy call;
 bid crown’d nectar circle round hall:
 jove shall thunder ethereal dome
 stern decrees, threaten’d woes come,
 soon shall freeze mankind dire surprise,
 damp eternal banquets skies.”
 
goddess said, sullen took place;
 black horror sadden’d celestial face.
 see gathering grudge every breast,
 smiles lips spleenful joy express’d;
 wrinkled front, eyebrow bent,
 sat stedfast care, lowering discontent.
 thus proceeds—“attend, ye powers above!
 know, ’tis madness contest jove:
 supreme sits; sees, pride sway.
 vassal godheads grudgingly obey:
 fierce majesty power controls;
 shakes thrones heaven, bends poles.
 submiss, immortals! wills, obey:
 thou, great mars, begin show way.
 behold ascalaphus! behold die,
 dare murmur, dare vent sigh;
 thy loved boasted offspring lies o’erthrown,
 loved boasted offspring thy own.”
 
stern mars, anguish slaughter’d son,
 smote rebelling breast, fierce begun:
 “thus then, immortals! thus shall mars obey;
 forgive me, gods, yield vengeance way:
 descending first yon forbidden plain,
 god battles dares avenge slain;
 dares, though thunder bursting o’er head
 hurl blazing heaps dead.”
 
gives command fear flight
 join rapid coursers fight:
 grim arms, hasty vengeance flies;
 arms reflect radiance skies.
 now jove, bold rebellion driven,
 discharged wrath half host heaven;
 pallas, springing bright abode,
 starts azure throne calm god.
 struck immortal race timely fear,
 frantic mars snatch’d shield spear;
 huge helmet lifting head,
 thus impetuous homicide said:
 
“by wild passion, furious! art thou toss’d?
 striv’st thou jove? thou art already lost.
 shall thunderer’s dread command restrain,
 imperial juno heard vain?
 back skies wouldst thou shame driven,
 thy guilt involve host heaven?
 ilion greece jove engage,
 skies yield ampler scene rage;
 guilty guiltless find equal fate
 one vast ruin whelm olympian state.
 cease thy offspring’s death unjust call;
 heroes great died, yet shall fall.
 heaven’s law foolish man comply
 exempted race ordain’d die?”
 
menace fix’d warrior throne;
 sullen sat, curb’d rising groan.
 juno call’d (jove’s orders obey)
 winged iris, god day.
 “go wait thunderer’s will (saturnia cried)
 yon tall summit fountful ide:
 father’s awful presence stand,
 receive, execute dread command.”
 
said, sat; god gilds day,
 various iris, wing airy way.
 swift wind, ida’s hills came,
 (fair nurse fountains, savage game)
 sat eternal; whose nod controls
 trembling world, shakes steady poles.
 veil’d mist fragrance found,
 clouds gold purple circled round.
 well-pleased thunderer saw earnest care,
 prompt obedience queen air;
 (while smile serenes awful brow)
 commands goddess showery bow:
 
“iris! descend, ordain,
 report yon mad tyrant main.
 bid fight deeps repair,
 breathe slaughter fields air.
 refuse, let timely weigh
 elder birthright, superior sway.
 shall rashness stand dire alarms,
 heaven’s omnipotence descend arms?
 strives me, power given,
 equal lord heaven?”
 
all-mighty spoke; goddess wing’d flight
 sacred ilion idaean height.
 swift rattling hail, fleecy snows,
 drive skies, boreas fiercely blows;
 clouds descending iris falls,
 blue neptune thus goddess calls:
 
“attend mandate sire above!
 behold messenger jove:
 bids thee forbidden wars repair
 thine deeps, fields air.
 refused, bids thee timely weigh
 elder birthright, superior sway.
 shall thy rashness stand dire alarms
 heaven’s omnipotence descend arms?
 striv’st thou power given?
 art thou equal lord heaven?”
 
“what means haughty sovereign skies?
 (the king ocean thus, incensed, replies;)
 rule will portion’d realms high;
 vassal god, train, i.
 three brother deities saturn came,
 ancient rhea, earth’s immortal dame:
 assign’d lot, triple rule know;
 infernal pluto sways shades below;
 o’er wide clouds, o’er starry plain,
 ethereal jove extends high domain;
 court beneath hoary waves keep,
 hush roarings sacred deep;
 olympus, earth, common lie:
 claim tyrant sky?
 far distant clouds let control,
 awe younger brothers pole;
 children commands given,
 trembling, servile, second race heaven.”
 
“and must (said she), sire floods!
 bear fierce answer king gods?
 correct yet, change thy rash intent;
 noble mind disdains repent.
 elder brothers guardian fiends given,
 scourge wretch insulting heaven.”
 
“great profit (thus god rejoin’d)
 ministers blest prudent mind:
 warn’d thy words, powerful jove yield,
 quit, though angry, contended field:
 threats justice disclaim,
 honours, birth same.
 yet, forgetful promise given
 hermes, pallas, queen heaven,
 favour ilion, perfidious place,
 breaks faith half ethereal race;
 give know, unless grecian train
 lay yon proud structures level plain,
 howe’er offence gods pass’d,
 wrath neptune shall ever last.”
 
thus speaking, furious field strode,
 plunged bosom flood.
 lord thunders, lofty height
 beheld, thus bespoke source light:
 
“behold! god whose liquid arms hurl’d
 around globe, whose earthquakes rock world,
 desists length rebel-war wage,
 seeks seas, trembles rage;
 else wrath, heaven’s thrones shaking round,
 burn’d bottom seas profound;
 gods round old saturn dwell
 heard thunders deeps hell.
 well crime, well vengeance spared;
 even power immense found battle hard.
 go thou, son! trembling greeks alarm,
 shake broad ægis thy active arm,
 godlike hector thy peculiar care,
 swell bold heart, urge strength war:
 let ilion conquer, till achaian train
 fly ships hellespont again:
 greece shall breathe toils.” godhead said;
 will divine jove obey’d.
 half swift sailing falcon flies,
 drives turtle liquid skies,
 phœbus, shooting idaean brow,
 glides mountain plain below.
 hector seated stream sees,
 sense returning coming breeze;
 pulses beat, spirits rise;
 loved companions meet eyes;
 jove thinking pains, pass’d away,
 god gives golden day:
 
“why sits great hector field far?
 grief, wound, withholds thee war?”
 
fainting hero, vision bright
 stood shining o’er him, half unseal’d sight:
 
“what blest immortal, commanding breath,
 thus wakens hector sleep death?
 fame told, how, trusty sword
 bathed greece slaughter, battle gored,
 mighty ajax deadly blow
 almost sunk shades below?
 even yet, methinks, gliding ghosts spy,
 hell’s black horrors swim eye.”
 
apollo: “be dismay’d;
 see, strong! thunderer sends thee aid.
 behold! thy phœbus shall arms employ,
 phœbus, propitious still thee troy.
 inspire thy warriors manly force,
 ships impel thy rapid horse:
 even will make thy fiery coursers way,
 drive grecians headlong sea.”
 
thus bold hector spoke jove,
 breathed immortal ardour above.
 pamper’d steed, reins unbound,
 breaks stall, pours along ground;
 ample strokes rushes flood,
 bathe sides, cool fiery blood;
 head, now freed, tosses skies;
 mane dishevell’d o’er shoulders flies:
 snuffs females well-known plain,
 springs, exulting, fields again:
 urged voice divine, thus hector flew,
 full god; hosts pursue.
 force men dogs combined
 invade mountain goat, branching hind;
 far hunter’s rage secure lie
 close rock, (not fated yet die)
 lo! lion shoots across way!
 fly: chasers prey.
 greece, late conquering troops pursued,
 mark’d progress ranks blood,
 soon see furious chief appear,
 forget vanquish, consent fear.
 
thoas grief observed dreadful course,
 thoas, bravest Ætolian force;
 skill’d direct javelin’s distant flight,
 bold combat standing fight,
 councils famed solid sense,
 winning words heavenly eloquence.
 “gods! portent (he cried) eyes invades?
 lo! hector rises stygian shades!
 saw him, late, thundering ajax kill’d:
 god restores frighted field;
 content half greece lie slain,
 pours new destruction sons again?
 comes not, jove! without thy powerful will;
 lo! still lives, pursues, conquers still!
 yet hear counsel, worst withstand:
 greeks’ main body fleet command;
 let brisker spirits warm,
 stand first onset, provoke storm.
 thus point arms; foes appear,
 fierce is, let hector learn fear.”
 
warrior spoke; listening greeks obey,
 thickening ranks, form deep array.
 
ajax, teucer, merion gave command,
 valiant leader cretan band;
 mars-like meges: chiefs excite,
 approach foe, meet coming fight.
 behind, unnumber’d multitudes attend,
 flank navy, shores defend.
 full front pressing trojans bear,
 hector first came towering war.
 phœbus rushing battle led;
 veil clouds involved radiant head:
 high held him, jove’s enormous shield
 portentous shone, shaded field;
 vulcan jove immortal gift consign’d,
 scatter hosts terrify mankind,
 greeks expect shock, clamours rise
 different parts, mingle skies.
 dire hiss darts, heroes flung,
 arrows leaping bow-string sung;
 drink life generous warriors slain:
 guiltless fall, thirst blood vain.
 long phœbus bore unmoved shield,
 sat doubtful conquest hovering o’er field;
 aloft shakes skies,
 shouts ears, lightens eyes,
 deep horror seizes every grecian breast,
 force humbled, fear confess’d.
 flies herd oxen, scatter’d wide,
 swain guard them, day guide,
 two fell lions mountain come,
 spread carnage shady gloom.
 impending phœbus pours around fear,
 troy hector thunder rear.
 heaps fall heaps: slaughter hector leads,
 first great arcesilas, stichius bleeds;
 one bold bœotians ever dear,
 one menestheus’ friend famed compeer.
 medon iasus, Æneas sped;
 sprang phelus, athenians led;
 hapless medon oïleus came;
 ajax honour’d brother’s name,
 though born lawless love: home expell’d,
 banish’d man, phylacè dwell’d,
 press’d vengeance angry wife;
 troy ends last labours life.
 mecystes next polydamas o’erthrew;
 thee, brave clonius, great agenor slew.
 paris, deiochus inglorious dies,
 pierced shoulder basely flies.
 polites’ arm laid echius plain;
 stretch’d one heap, victors spoil slain.
 greeks dismay’d, confused, disperse fall,
 seek trench, skulk behind wall.
 fly trembling, others pant breath,
 o’er slaughter stalks gigantic death.
 rush’d bold hector, gloomy night;
 forbids plunder, animates fight,
 points fleet: “for, gods! flies,[240]
 dares linger, hand dies;
 weeping sister cold eye shall close,
 friendly hand funeral pyre compose.
 stops plunder signal hour,
 birds shall tear him, dogs devour.”
 furious said; smarting scourge resounds;
 coursers fly; smoking chariot bounds;
 hosts rush on; loud clamours shake shore;
 horses thunder, earth ocean roar!
 apollo, planted trench’s bound,
 push’d bank: sank enormous mound:
 roll’d ditch heapy ruin lay;
 sudden road! long ample way.
 o’er dread fosse (a late impervious space)
 now steeds, men, cars tumultuous pass.
 wondering crowds downward level trod;
 flamed shield, march’d god.
 hand shook mighty wall;
 lo! turrets nod, bulwarks fall:
 easy ashore infant stands,
 draws imagined houses sands;
 sportive wanton, pleased new play,
 sweeps slight works fashion’d domes away:
 thus vanish’d thy touch, towers walls;
 toil thousands moment falls.
 
grecians gaze around wild despair,
 confused, weary powers prayer:
 exhort men, praises, threats, commands;
 urge gods, voices, eyes, hands.
 experienced nestor chief obtests skies,
 weeps country father’s eyes.
 
“o jove! ever, native shore,
 one greek enrich’d thy shrine offer’d gore;
 e’er, hope country behold,
 paid fattest firstlings fold;
 e’er thou sign’st wishes thy nod:
 perform promise gracious god!
 day preserve navies flame,
 save relics grecian name.”
 
thus prayed sage: eternal gave consent,
 peals thunder shook firmament.
 presumptuous troy mistook accepting sign,
 catch’d new fury voice divine.
 as, black tempests mix seas skies,
 roaring deeps watery mountains rise,
 sides tall ship ascend,
 womb deluge, ribs rend:
 thus loudly roaring, o’erpowering all,
 mount thick trojans grecian wall;
 legions legions side arise:
 thick sound keels; storm arrows flies.
 fierce ships above, cars below,
 wield mace, javelin throw.
 
thus thunder battle raged,
 labouring armies round works engaged,
 still tent patroclus sat tend
 good eurypylus, wounded friend.
 sprinkles healing balms, anguish kind,
 adds discourse, medicine mind.
 saw, ascending fleet,
 victorious troy; then, starting seat,
 bitter groans sorrows express’d,
 wrings hands, beats manly breast.
 “though yet thy state require redress (he cries)
 depart must: horrors strike eyes!
 charged achilles’ high command go,
 mournful witness scene woe;
 haste urge country’s care
 rise arms, shine war.
 perhaps favouring god soul may bend;
 voice powerful faithful friend.”
 
spoke; and, speaking, swifter wind
 sprung tent, left war behind.
 embodied greeks fierce attack sustain,
 strive, though numerous, repulse vain:
 trojans, firm array,
 force fleet tents impervious way.
 shipwright, palladian art,
 smooths rough wood, levels every part;
 equal hand guides whole design,
 just rule, directing line:
 martial leaders, like skill care,
 preserved line, equal kept war.
 brave deeds arms ranks tried,
 every ship sustained equal tide.
 one proud bark, high-towering o’er fleet,
 ajax great, godlike hector meet;
 one bright prize matchless chiefs contend,
 ships can fire, defend:
 one kept shore, one vessel trod;
 fix’d fate, acted god.
 clytius daring hand,
 deck approaching, shakes flaming brand;
 but, pierced telamon’s huge lance, expires:
 thundering falls, drops extinguish’d fires.
 great hector view’d sad survey,
 stretch’d dust stern lay.
 “oh! trojan, lycian race!
 stand arms, maintain arduous space:
 lo! royal clytius lies;
 ah, save arms, secure obsequies!”
 
said, eager javelin sought foe:
 ajax shunn’d meditated blow.
 vainly yet forceful lance thrown;
 stretch’d dust unhappy lycophron:
 exile long, sustain’d ajax’ board,
 faithful servant foreign lord;
 peace, war, ever side,
 near loved master, lived, died.
 high poop tumbles sand,
 lies lifeless load along land.
 anguish ajax views piercing sight,
 thus inflames brother fight:
 
“teucer, behold! extended shore
 friend, loved companion! now more!
 dear parent, parent’s care
 fight wars left native air.
 death deplored, hector’s rage owe;
 revenge, revenge cruel foe.
 darts fates attend?
 bow phœbus taught bend?”
 
impatient teucer, hastening aid,
 chief ample bow display’d;
 well-stored quiver shoulders hung:
 hiss’d arrow, bowstring sung.
 clytus, pisenor’s son, renown’d fame,
 (to thee, polydamas! honour’d name)
 drove thickest embattled plains
 startling steeds, shook eager reins.
 glory ran ardent mind,
 pointed death arrests behind:
 fair neck thrilling arrow flies;
 youth’s first bloom reluctantly dies.
 hurl’d lofty seat, distance far,
 headlong coursers spurn empty car;
 till sad polydamas steeds restrain’d,
 gave, astynous, thy careful hand;
 then, fired vengeance, rush’d amidst foe:
 rage edged sword, strengthen’d every blow.
 
bold teucer, country’s cause,
 hector’s breast chosen arrow draws:
 weapon found destined way,
 thy fall, great trojan! renown’d day.
 hector doom’d perish then:
 all-wise disposer fates men
 (imperial jove) present death withstands;
 glory due teucer’s hands.
 full stretch tough string drew,
 struck arm unseen, burst two;
 dropp’d bow: shaft brazen head
 fell innocent, dust lay dead.
 astonish’d archer great ajax cries;
 “some god prevents destined enterprise:
 god, propitious trojan foe,
 has, arm unfailing, struck bow,
 broke nerve hands twined art,
 strong impel flight many dart.”
 
“since heaven commands (ajax made reply)
 dismiss bow, lay thy arrows by:
 thy arms less suffice lance wield,
 quit quiver ponderous shield.
 first ranks indulge thy thirst fame,
 thy brave example shall rest inflame.
 fierce are, long successes vain;
 force fleet, even ship gain,
 asks toil, sweat, blood: utmost might
 shall find match—no more: ’tis fight.”
 
teucer laid faithless bow aside;
 fourfold buckler o’er shoulder tied;
 brave head crested helm placed,
 nodding horse-hair formidably graced;
 dart, whose point brass refulgent shines,
 warrior wields; great brother joins.
 
hector saw, thus express’d joy:
 “ye troops lycia, dardanus, troy!
 mindful yourselves, ancient fame,
 spread glory navy’s flame.
 jove us; saw hand, now,
 proud archer strike vaunted bow:
 indulgent jove! plain thy favours shine,
 happy nations bear marks divine!
 easy then, see sinking state
 realms accursed, deserted, reprobate!
 fate greece, ours:
 behold, ye warriors, exert powers.
 death worst; fate must try;
 country, ’tis bliss die.
 gallant man, though slain fight be,
 yet leaves nation safe, children free;
 entails debt grateful state;
 brave friends shall glory fate;
 wife live honour’d, race succeed,
 late posterity enjoy deed!”
 
roused soul every trojan breast:
 godlike ajax next greeks address’d:
 
“how long, ye warriors argive race,
 (to generous argos dire disgrace!)
 long cursed confines will ye lie,
 yet undetermined, live die?
 hopes remain, methods retire,
 vessels catch trojan fire?
 mark flames approach, near fall,
 hector calls, troy obeys call!
 dance dreadful voice invites,
 calls death, rage fights.
 ’tis now time wisdom debates;
 hands trusted fates;
 better far one decisive strife,
 one day end labour life,
 keep hard-got inch barren sands,
 still press’d, press’d inglorious hands.”
 
listening grecians feel leader’s flame,
 every kindling bosom pants fame.
 mutual slaughters spread either side;
 hector phocian schedius died;
 there, pierced ajax, sunk laodamas,
 chief foot, old antenor’s race.
 polydamas laid otus sand,
 fierce commander epeian band.
 lance bold meges victor threw;
 victor, stooping, death withdrew;
 (that valued life, phœbus! thy care)
 croesmus’ bosom took flying spear:
 corpse fell bleeding slippery shore;
 radiant arms triumphant meges bore.
 dolops, lampus, rushes on,
 sprung race old laomedon,
 famed prowess well-fought field,
 pierced centre sounding shield:
 meges, phyleus’ ample breastplate wore,
 (well-known fight sellè’s winding shore;
 king euphetes gave golden mail,
 compact, firm many jointed scale)
 oft, cities storm’d, battles won,
 saved father, now saves son.
 full trojan’s head urged lance,
 high plumes helmet dance,
 new ting’d tyrian dye: dust below,
 shorn crest, purple honours glow.
 meantime fight spartan king survey’d,
 stood meges’ side sudden aid.
 dolops’ shoulder urged forceful dart,
 held passage panting heart,
 issued breast. thundering sound
 warrior falls, extended ground.
 rush conquering greeks spoil slain:
 hector’s voice excites kindred train;
 hero most, hicetaon sprung,
 fierce melanippus, gallant, brave, young.
 (ere troy grecians cross’d main)
 fed large oxen percotè’s plain;
 oppress’d, country claim’d care,
 return’d ilion, excell’d war;
 this, priam’s court, held place,
 beloved less priam’s royal race.
 hector singled, troops led,
 thus inflamed him, pointing dead.
 
“lo, melanippus! lo, dolops lies;
 thus royal kinsman dies?
 o’ermatch’d falls; two prey,
 lo! bear bloody arms away!
 come on—a distant war longer wage,
 hand hand thy country’s foes engage:
 till greece once, glory end;
 ilion towery height descend,
 heaved lowest stone; bury all
 one sad sepulchre, one common fall.”
 
hector (this said) rush’d forward foes:
 equal ardour melanippus glows:
 ajax thus—“o greeks! respect fame,
 respect yourselves, learn honest shame:
 let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,
 catch breast breast noble fire,
 valour’s side odds combat lie;
 brave live glorious, lamented die;
 wretch trembles field fame,
 meets death, worse death, eternal shame.”
 
generous sense vain imparts;
 sunk, rooted grecian hearts:
 join, throng, thicken call,
 flank navy brazen wall;
 shields touching shields, order blaze above,
 stop trojans, though impell’d jove.
 fiery spartan first, loud applause.
 warms bold nestor cause.
 “is (he said) arms youth like you,
 strong fight, active pursue?
 stand distant, attempt deed?
 lift bold lance, make trojan bleed.”
 
said; backward lines retired;
 forth rush’d youth martial fury fired,
 beyond foremost ranks; lance threw,
 round black battalions cast view.
 troops troy recede sudden fear,
 swift javelin hiss’d along air.
 advancing melanippus met dart
 bold breast, felt heart:
 thundering falls; falling arms resound,
 broad buckler rings ground.
 victor leaps upon prostrate prize:
 thus roe well-breath’d beagle flies,
 rends side, fresh-bleeding dart
 distant hunter sent heart.
 observing hector rescue flew;
 bold was, antilochus withdrew.
 savage, ranging o’er plain,
 torn shepherd’s dog, shepherd’s swain,
 conscious deed, glares around,
 hears gathering multitude resound,
 timely flies yet-untasted food,
 gains friendly shelter wood:
 fears youth; troy shouts pursue,
 stones darts mingled tempest flew;
 enter’d grecian ranks, turns
 manly breast, new fury burns.
 
now fleet tides trojans drove,
 fierce fulfil stern decrees jove:
 sire gods, confirming thetis’ prayer,
 grecian ardour quench’d deep despair;
 lifts glory troy’s prevailing bands,
 swells hearts, strengthens hands.
 ida’s top waits longing eyes,
 view navy blazing skies;
 then, till then, scale war shall turn,
 trojans fly, conquer’d ilion burn.
 fates revolved almighty mind,
 raises hector work design’d,
 bids mortal fury glow,
 drives him, like lightning, foe.
 mars, human crimes vengeance call,
 shakes huge javelin, whole armies fall.
 rage conflagration rolls,
 wraps vast mountains, involves poles.
 foams wrath; beneath gloomy brow
 like fiery meteors red eye-balls glow:
 radiant helmet temple burns,
 waves nods, lightens turns:
 jove splendour round chief thrown,
 cast blaze hosts one.
 unhappy glories! fate near,
 due stern pallas, pelides’ spear:
 yet jove deferr’d death pay,
 gave fate allow’d, honours day!
 
now fire fame, breast, eyes
 burn foe, single every prize;
 still closest ranks, thickest fight,
 points ardour, exerts might.
 grecian phalanx, moveless tower,
 sides batter’d, yet resists power:
 tall rock o’erhangs hoary main,[241]
 winds assail’d, billows beat vain,
 unmoved hears, above, tempest blow,
 sees watery mountains break below.
 girt surrounding flames, seems fall
 like fire jove, bursts upon all:
 bursts wave cloud impends,
 and, swell’d tempests, ship descends;
 white decks foam; winds aloud
 howl o’er masts, sing every shroud:
 pale, trembling, tired, sailors freeze fears;
 instant death every wave appears.
 pale greeks eyes hector meet,
 chief thunders, shakes fleet.
 
lion, rushing den,
 amidst plain wide-water’d fen,
 (where numerous oxen, ease feed,
 large expatiate o’er ranker mead)
 leaps herds herdsman’s eyes;
 trembling herdsman far distance flies;
 lordly bull (the rest dispersed fled)
 singles out; arrests, lays dead.
 thus rage jove-like hector flew
 greece heaps; one seized, slew:
 mycenian periphes, mighty name,
 wisdom great, arms well known fame;
 minister stern eurystheus’ ire
 alcides, copreus sire:
 redeem’d honours race,
 generous sire base;
 o’er country’s youth conspicuous far
 every virtue, peace war:
 doom’d hector’s stronger force yield!
 margin ample shield
 struck hasty foot: heels up-sprung;
 supine fell; brazen helmet rung.
 fallen chief invading trojan press’d,
 plunged pointed javelin breast.
 circling friends, strove guard late
 unhappy hero, fled, shared fate.
 
chased foremost line, grecian train
 now man next, receding toward main:
 wedged one body tents stand,
 wall’d round sterns, gloomy, desperate band.
 now manly shame forbids inglorious flight;
 now fear confines fight:
 man courage breathes man; nestor most
 (the sage preserver grecian host)
 exhorts, adjures, guard utmost shores;
 parents, implores.
 
“oh friends! men: generous breasts inflame
 mutual honour, mutual shame!
 think hopes, fortunes; care
 wives, infants, parents share:
 think living father’s reverend head;
 think ancestor glory dead;
 absent, speak, sue,
 ask safety, fame, you:
 gods fates one action lay,
 lost, desert day.”
 
spoke, round breathed heroic fires;
 minerva seconds sage inspires.
 mist darkness jove around threw
 clear’d, restoring war view;
 sudden ray shot beaming o’er plain,
 show’d shores, navy, main:
 hector saw, fly, fight,
 scene wide-opening blaze light,
 first field great ajax strikes eyes,
 port majestic, ample size:
 ponderous mace studs iron crown’d,
 full twenty cubits long, swings around;
 fights, like others, fix’d certain stands
 looks moving tower bands;
 high decks vast gigantic stride,
 godlike hero stalks side side.
 horseman watery mead
 (skill’d manage bounding steed)
 drives four fair coursers, practised obey,
 great city public way;
 safe art, side side run,
 shifts seat, vaults one one;
 now this, now flies;
 admiring numbers follow eyes.
 
ship ship thus ajax swiftly flew,
 less wonder warring crew.
 furious, hector thunder’d threats aloud,
 rush’d enraged trojan crowd;
 swift invades ships, whose beaky prores
 lay rank’d contiguous bending shores;
 strong eagle airy height,
 marks swans’ cranes’ embodied flight,
 stoops impetuous, light food,
 and, stooping, darkens wings flood.
 jove leads almighty hand,
 breathes fierce spirits following band.
 warring nations meet, battle roars,
 thick beats combat sounding prores.
 thou wouldst thought, furious fire,
 force tame them, toil tire;
 new vigour new fights won,
 long battle begun.
 greece, yet unconquer’d, kept alive war,
 secure death, confiding despair:
 troy proud hopes already view’d main
 bright blaze, red heroes slain:
 like strength felt hope, despair,
 contends, war.
 
’twas thou, bold hector! whose resistless hand
 first seized ship contested strand;
 dead protesilaüs bore,[242]
 first touch’d unhappy trojan shore:
 arms warring nations stood,
 bathed generous breasts mutual blood.
 room poise lance bend bow;
 hand hand, man man, grow:
 wounded, wound; seek other’s hearts
 falchions, axes, swords, shorten’d darts.
 falchions ring, shields rattle, axes sound,
 swords flash air, glitter ground;
 streaming blood slippery shores dyed,
 slaughter’d heroes swell dreadful tide.
 
still raging, hector ample hand
 grasps high stern, gives loud command:
 

[illustration: ] ajax defending greek ships
 

“haste, bring flames! toil ten long years
 finished; day desired appears!
 happy day acclamations greet,
 bright destruction yon hostile fleet.
 coward-counsels timorous throng
 reverend dotards check’d glory long:
 long jove lull’d us lethargic charms,
 now peals thunder calls arms:
 great day crowns full desires,
 wakes force, seconds fires.”
 
spoke—the warriors fierce command
 pour new deluge grecian band.
 even ajax paused, (so thick javelins fly,)
 stepp’d back, doubted live die.
 yet, oars placed, stands wait
 chief approaching dares attempt fate:
 even last naval charge defends,
 now shakes spear, now lifts, now protends;
 even yet, greeks piercing shouts inspires,
 amidst attacks, deaths, darts, fires.
 
“o friends! heroes! names ever dear,
 sons mars, thunderbolts war!
 ah! yet mindful old renown,
 great forefathers’ virtues own.
 aids expect utmost strait?
 bulwarks rising fate?
 aids, bulwarks retreat attend,
 friends help, city defend.
 spot have, lose keep;
 stand trojans, rolls deep.
 ’tis hostile ground tread; native lands
 far, far hence: fates hands.”
 
raging spoke; wastes breath,
 turns javelin work death.
 whate’er bold trojan arm’d daring hands,
 sable ships, flaming brands,
 well chief naval weapon sped,
 luckless warrior stern lay dead:
 full twelve, boldest, moment fell,
 sent great ajax shades hell.

argument
 

sixth battle, acts death patroclus
 

patroclus (in pursuance request nestor eleventh book)
 entreats achilles suffer go assistance greeks
 achilles’ troops armour. agrees it, time
 charges content rescuing fleet, without further
 pursuit enemy. armour, horses, soldiers, officers are
 described. achilles offers libation success friend,
 patroclus leads myrmidons battle. trojans, at
 sight patroclus achilles’ armour, taking hero,
 cast uttermost consternation; beats the
 vessels, hector flies, sarpedon killed, though jupiter was
 averse fate. several particulars battle are
 described; heat which, patroclus, neglecting orders of
 achilles, pursues foe walls troy, apollo repulses
 disarms him, euphorbus wounds him, hector kills him, which
 concludes book.
 

warr’d armies ensanguined shore,
 black vessels smoked human gore.
 meantime patroclus achilles flies;
 streaming tears fall copious eyes.
 faster, trickling plains below,
 tall rock sable waters flow.
 divine pelides, compassion moved.
 thus spoke, indulgent, best beloved:[243]
 
“patroclus, say, grief thy bosom bears,
 flows fast unmanly tears?
 girl, infant mother keeps
 loved breast, fonder passion weeps;
 mother’s soul, infant warms,
 clung knees, reaching arms,
 thou hast mine! oh tell me, end
 thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend?
 
“griev’st thou me, martial band?
 come sad tidings native land?
 fathers live (our first, tender care),
 thy good menoetius breathes vital air,
 hoary peleus yet extends days;
 pleased age hear children’s praise.
 may meaner cause thy pity claim?
 perhaps yon relics grecian name,
 doom’d ships sink fire sword,
 pay forfeit haughty lord?
 whate’er cause, reveal thy secret care,
 speak sorrows friend share.”
 sigh instant bosom broke,
 another follow’d, patroclus spoke:
 
“let greece length pity touch thy breast,
 thyself greek; and, once, greeks best!
 lo! every chief might fate prevent,
 lies pierced wounds, bleeding tent:
 eurypylus, tydides, atreus’ son,
 wise ulysses, navy groan,
 country’s wounds own.
 pain soft arts pharmacy can ease,
 thy breast alone lenitives appease.
 may never rage like thine soul enslave,
 great vain! unprofitably brave!
 thy country slighted last distress,
 friend, man, thee shall hope redress?
 no—men unborn, ages yet behind,
 shall curse fierce, unforgiving mind.
 
“o man unpitying! man thy race;
 sure thou spring’st soft embrace,
 ever amorous hero caused thy birth,
 ever tender goddess brought thee forth:
 rugged rock’s hard entrails gave thee form,
 raging seas produced thee storm,
 soul well suiting tempestuous kind,
 rough thy manners, untamed thy mind.
 
“if dire oracle thy breast alarm,
 aught jove, thetis, stop thy arm,
 beam comfort yet greece may shine,
 lead myrmidonian line:
 clad thy dreadful arms appear,
 proud troy shall tremble, desert war;
 without thy person greece shall win day,
 thy mere image chase foes away.
 press’d fresh forces, o’erlabour’d train
 shall quit ships, greece respire again.”
 thus, blind fate! supplicating breath,
 thou begg’st arms, arms thy death.
 unfortunately good! boding sigh
 thy friend return’d; it, reply:
 “patroclus! thy achilles knows fears;
 words jove oracles hears;
 aught mother’s caution can suggest;
 tyrant’s pride lies rooted breast.
 wrongs, wrongs, constant thought engage,
 those, sole oracles, inspire rage:
 made tyrant: gave power wrong
 even me: felt it; shall feel long.
 maid, black-eyed maid, forced away,
 due toils many well-fought day;
 due conquest father’s reign;
 due votes grecian train.
 forced her; me, bold brave,
 disgraced, dishonour’d, like meanest slave.
 bear this—the wrongs grieve past;
 ’tis time fury relent last:
 fix’d date; day wish’d appears:
 hector ships battle bears,
 flames eyes, shouts invade ears.
 go then, patroclus! court fair honour’s charms
 troy’s famed fields, achilles’ arms:
 lead forth martial myrmidons fight,
 go save fleets, conquer right.
 see thin relics baffled band
 last edge yon deserted land!
 behold ilion ships descends;
 cloud blackens, storm impends!
 thus, when, sight amazed,
 troy saw trembled, helmet blazed:
 injurious king friendship lost,
 yon ample trench buried half host.
 camps, bulwarks now trojans fear,
 dreadful, achilles there;
 longer flames lance tydeus’ son;
 general calls heroes on:
 hector, alone, hear; dreadful breath
 commands slaughter, proclaims death.
 yet now, patroclus, issue plain:
 now save ships, rising fires restrain,
 give greeks visit greece again.
 heed words, mark friend’s command,
 trusts fame honours thy hand,
 thy deeds expects achaian host
 shall render back beauteous maid lost:
 rage uncontroll’d hostile crew,
 touch hector, hector due.
 though jove thunder command war,
 just, consult glory, forbear.
 fleet saved, desist chase,
 lead ilion’s walls grecian race;
 adverse god thy rashness may destroy;
 god, like phœbus, ever kind troy.
 let greece, redeem’d destructive strait,
 work; leave rest fate.
 o! immortal powers above,
 apollo, pallas, almighty jove!
 one trojan might left alive,
 greek race survive:
 might vast destruction shun,
 destroy accursed town!”
 conference held chiefs; strand
 great jove conquest crown’d trojan band.
 ajax sounding storm sustain’d,
 thick darts iron tempest rain’d:
 tired arm weighty buckler hung;
 hollow helm falling javelins rung;
 breath, quick short pantings, comes goes;
 painful sweat members flows.
 spent o’erpower’d, barely breathes most;
 yet scarce army stirs post;
 dangers dangers around glow,
 toil toil, woe succeeds woe.
 
say, muses, throned starry frame,
 first navy blazed trojan flame?
 
stern hector waved sword, standing near,
 furious ajax plied ashen spear,
 full lance stroke justly sped,
 broad falchion lopp’d brazen head;
 pointless spear warrior shakes vain;
 brazen head falls sounding plain.
 great ajax saw, own’d hand divine;
 confessing jove, trembling sign,
 warn’d retreats. swift sides pour
 hissing brands; thick streams fiery shower;
 o’er high stern curling volumes rise,
 sheets rolling smoke involve skies.
 
divine achilles view’d rising flames,
 smote thigh, thus aloud exclaims:
 “arm, arm, patroclus! lo, blaze aspires!
 glowing ocean reddens fires.
 arm, ere vessels catch spreading flame;
 arm, ere grecians name;
 haste bring troops.”—the hero said;
 friend ardour joy obey’d.
 
cased limbs brass; first around
 manly legs, silver buckles bound
 clasping greaves; breast applies
 flaming cuirass thousand dyes;
 emblazed studs gold falchion shone
 rich belt, starry zone:
 achilles’ shield ample shoulders spread,
 achilles’ helmet nodded o’er head:
 adorn’d terrible array,
 flash’d around intolerable day.
 alone untouch’d, pelides’ javelin stands,
 poised pelides’ hands:
 pelion’s shady brow plant entire
 old chiron rent, shaped sire;
 whose son’s great arm alone weapon wields,
 death heroes, dread fields.
 

[illustration: ] buckles
 

brave automedon (an honour’d name,
 second lord love fame,
 peace friend, partner war)
 winged coursers harness’d car;
 xanthus balius, immortal breed,
 sprung wind, like wind speed.
 wing’d harpy, swift podarge, bore,
 zephyr pregnant breezy shore:
 swift pedasus added side,
 (once great aëtion’s, now achilles’ pride)
 who, like strength, swiftness, grace,
 mortal courser match’d immortal race.
 
achilles speeds tent tent, warms
 hardy myrmidons blood arms.
 breathing death, around chief stand,
 grim, terrific, formidable band:
 grim voracious wolves, seek springs[244]
 scalding thirst burning bowels wrings;
 tall stag, fresh-slaughtered wood,
 drench’d wide insatiate throats blood,
 black fount rush, hideous throng,
 paunch distended, lolling tongue,
 fire fills eye, black jaws belch gore,
 gorged slaughter still thirst more.
 like furious, rush’d myrmidonian crew,
 dread strength, deathful view.
 
high midst great achilles stands,
 directs order, war commands.
 he, loved jove, launch’d ilion’s shores
 full fifty vessels, mann’d fifty oars:
 five chosen leaders fierce bands obey,
 supreme valour, sway.
 
first march’d menestheus, celestial birth,
 derived thee, whose waters wash earth,
 divine sperchius! jove-descended flood!
 mortal mother mixing god.
 menestheus, miscall’d fame
 borus, espoused dame.
 
eudorus next; polymele gay,
 famed graceful dance, produced to-day.
 her, sly cellenius loved: gaze,
 swift step form’d running maze:
 high chamber diana’s quire,
 god pursued her, urged, crown’d fire.
 confess’d father’s heavenly race,
 heir’d mother’s swiftness chase.
 strong echecleus, bless’d charms
 pleased god, succeeded arms;
 conscious loves, long hid fame,
 gifts price sought won dame;
 secret offspring sire bare;
 sire caress’d parent’s care.
 
pisander follow’d; matchless art
 wing spear, aim distant dart;
 hand sure emathian line,
 surer, great patroclus! thine.
 
fourth phœnix’ grave command graced,
 laerces’ valiant offspring led last.
 
soon achilles superior care
 call’d chiefs, order’d war,
 stern remembrance troops gave:
 “ye far-famed myrmidons, ye fierce brave!
 think threats dared trojan throng,
 think reproach ears endured long;
 ‘stern peleus, (thus ye used say,
 restless, raging, ships lay)
 oh nursed gall, unknowing yield;
 whose rage defrauds us famed field:
 dire fury must ever burn,
 make here? return, ye chiefs, return!’
 words—now, warriors! grieve more,
 trojans; bathe swords gore!
 day shall give soul demands,
 glut hearts, weary hands!”
 

[illustration: ] diana
 

thus roused fire every breast,
 close close listening cohorts press’d;
 ranks wedged ranks; arms steely ring
 still grows, spreads, thickens round king.
 circling wall builder forms,
 strength defensive wind storms,
 compacted stones thickening work compose,
 round wide rising structure grows:
 helm helm, crest crest throng,
 shield urged shield, man drove man along;
 thick, undistinguish’d plumes, together join’d,
 float one sea, wave wind.
 
far o’er rest glittering pomp appear,
 bold automedon, patroclus here;
 brothers arms, equal fury fired;
 two friends, two bodies one soul inspired.
 
mindful gods, achilles went
 rich coffer shady tent;
 lay heaps various garments roll’d,
 costly furs, carpets stiff gold,
 (the presents silver-footed dame)
 thence took bowl, antique frame,
 never man stained ruddy wine,
 raised offerings power divine,
 peleus’ son; peleus’ none
 raised offerings, jove alone.
 tinged sulphur, sacred first flame,
 purged; wash’d running stream.
 cleansed hands; fixing space
 eyes heaven, feet upon place
 sacrifice, purple draught pour’d
 forth midst; thus god implored:
 
“o thou supreme! high-throned height above!
 great pelasgic, dodonaean jove!
 ’midst surrounding frosts, vapours chill,
 presid’st bleak dodona’s vocal hill:
 (whose groves selli, race austere! surround,
 feet unwash’d, slumbers ground;
 hear, rustling oaks, thy dark decrees;
 catch fates, low-whispered breeze;)
 hear, old! thou gav’st, thetis’ prayer,
 glory me, greeks despair.
 lo, dangers fighting field
 best, dearest friends, yield,
 though still determined, ships confined;
 patroclus gone, stay half behind.
 oh! guard thy providential care,
 confirm heart, string arm war:
 press’d single force let hector see
 fame arms owing me.
 fleets saved foes fire,
 let conquest renown retire;
 preserve arms, preserve social train,
 safe return eyes again!”
 
great jove consents half chief’s request,
 heaven’s eternal doom denies rest;
 free fleet granted prayer;
 safe return, winds dispersed air.
 back tent stern achilles flies,
 waits combat impatient eyes.
 
meanwhile troops beneath patroclus’ care,
 invade trojans, commence war.
 wasps, provoked children play,
 pour mansions broad highway,
 swarms guiltless traveller engage,
 whet stings, call forth rage:
 rise arms, and, general cry,
 assert waxen domes, buzzing progeny.
 thus tents fervent legion swarms,
 loud clamours, keen arms:
 rising rage patroclus’ breath inspires,
 thus inflames heroic fires:
 
“o warriors, partners achilles’ praise!
 mindful deeds ancient days;
 godlike master let acts proclaim,
 add new glories mighty name.
 think achilles sees fight: brave,
 humble proud monarch save.”
 
joyful heard, kindling spoke,
 flew fleet, involved fire smoke.
 shore shore doubling shouts resound,
 hollow ships return deeper sound.
 war stood still, around gazed,
 great achilles’ shining armour blazed:
 troy saw, thought dread achilles nigh,
 see, tremble, fly.
 
first thy spear, divine patroclus! flew,
 war raged, tumult grew.
 close stern famed ship bore
 unbless’d protesilaus ilion’s shore,
 great pæonian, bold pyrechmes stood;
 (who led bands axius’ winding flood;)
 shoulder-blade receives fatal wound;
 groaning warrior pants upon ground.
 troops, see country’s glory slain,
 fly diverse, scatter’d o’er distant plain.
 patroclus’ arm forbids spreading fires,
 half-burn’d ship proud troy retires;
 clear’d smoke joyful navy lies;
 heaps heaps foe tumultuous flies;
 triumphant greece rescued decks ascends,
 loud acclaim starry region rends.
 thick clouds enwrap mountain’s head,
 o’er heaven’s expanse like one black ceiling spread;
 sudden thunderer, flashing ray,
 bursts darkness, lets day:
 hills shine out, rocks prospect rise,
 streams, vales, forests, strike eyes;
 smiling scene wide opens sight,
 unmeasured ether flames light.
 
troy repulsed, scatter’d o’er plains,
 forced navy, yet fight maintains.
 now every greek hostile hero slew,
 still foremost, bold patroclus flew:
 areilycus turn’d round,
 sharp thigh felt piercing wound;
 brazen-pointed spear, vigour thrown,
 thigh transfix’d, broke brittle bone:
 headlong fell. next, thoas thy chance;
 thy breast, unarm’d, received spartan lance.
 phylides’ dart (as amphidus drew nigh)
 blow prevented, transpierced thigh,
 tore brawn, rent nerves away;
 darkness, death, warrior lay.
 
equal arms two sons nestor stand,
 two bold brothers lycian band:
 great antilochus, atymnius dies,
 pierced flank, lamented youth! lies,
 kind maris, bleeding brother’s wound,
 defends breathless carcase ground;
 furious flies, murderer engage:
 godlike thrasimed prevents rage,
 arm shoulder aims blow;
 arm falls spouting dust below:
 sinks, endless darkness cover’d o’er:
 vents soul, effused gushing gore.
 
slain two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,
 sarpedon’s friends, amisodarus’ seed;
 amisodarus, who, furies led,
 bane men, abhorr’d chimaera bred;
 skill’d dart vain, sons expire,
 pay forfeit guilty sire.
 
stopp’d tumult cleobulus lies,
 beneath oïleus’ arm, living prize;
 living prize long trojan stood;
 thirsty falchion drank reeking blood:
 plunged throat smoking weapon lies;
 black death, fate unpitying, seal eyes.
 
amid ranks, mutual thirst fame,
 lycon brave, fierce peneleus came;
 vain javelins flew,
 now, met arms, eager swords drew.
 plumed crest bœotian foe
 daring lycon aim’d noble blow;
 sword broke short; his, peneleus sped
 full juncture neck head:
 head, divided stroke just,
 hung skin; body sunk dust.
 
o’ertaken neamas merion bleeds,
 pierced shoulder mounts steeds;
 back car tumbles ground:
 swimming eyes eternal shades surround.
 
next erymas doom’d fate feel,
 open’d mouth received cretan steel:
 beneath brain point passage tore,
 crash’d thin bones, drown’d teeth gore:
 mouth, eyes, nostrils, pour flood;
 sobs soul gush blood.
 
flocks neglected swain,
 kids, lambs, lie scatter’d o’er plain,
 troop wolves unguarded charge survey,
 rend trembling, unresisting prey:
 thus foe greeks impetuous came;
 troy fled, unmindful former fame.
 
still hector godlike ajax aim’d,
 still, pointed breast, javelin flamed.
 trojan chief, experienced field,
 o’er broad shoulders spread massy shield,
 observed storm darts grecians pour,
 buckler caught ringing shower:
 sees greece scale conquest rise,
 yet stops, turns, saves loved allies.
 
hand jove tempest forms,
 rolls cloud blacken heaven storms,
 dark o’er fields ascending vapour flies,
 shades sun, blots golden skies:
 ships, along dusky plain,
 dire flight terror drove trojan train.
 even hector fled; heads disarray
 fiery coursers forced lord away:
 far behind trojans fall confused;
 wedged trench, one vast carnage bruised:
 chariots chariots roll: clashing spokes
 shock; madding steeds break short yokes.
 vain labour steepy mound;
 charioteers lie foaming ground.
 fierce rear, shouts patroclus flies;
 tumultuous clamour fills fields skies;
 thick drifts dust involve rapid flight;
 clouds rise clouds, heaven snatch’d sight.
 affrighted steeds dying lords cast down,
 scour o’er fields, stretch reach town.
 loud o’er rout heard victor’s cry,
 war bleeds, thickest die,
 horse arms, chariots lie o’erthrown,
 bleeding heroes axles groan.
 stop, check, steeds peleus knew:
 bank bank immortal coursers flew.
 high-bounding o’er fosse, whirling car
 smokes ranks, o’ertakes flying war,
 thunders hector; hector flies,
 patroclus shakes lance; fate denies.
 less noise, less impetuous force,
 tide trojans urge desperate course,
 autumn jove fury pours,
 earth loaden incessant showers;
 (when guilty mortals break eternal laws,
 judges, bribed, betray righteous cause;)
 deep beds bids rivers rise,
 opens flood-gates skies:
 impetuous torrents hills obey,
 whole fields drown’d, mountains swept away;
 loud roars deluge till meets main;
 trembling man sees labours vain!
 
now chief (the foremost troops repell’d)
 back ships destined progress held,
 bore half troy resistless way,
 forced routed ranks stand day.
 space silver simois flows,
 lay fleets, rampires rose,
 grim dust blood patroclus stands,
 turns slaughter conquering bands.
 first pronous died beneath fiery dart,
 pierced shield valiant heart.
 thestor next, saw chief appear,
 fell victim coward fear;
 shrunk sat, wild haggard eye,
 stood combat, force fly;
 patroclus mark’d shunn’d war,
 unmanly tremblings shook car,
 dropp’d flowing reins. ’twixt jaws,
 javelin sticks, chariot draws.
 rock overhangs main,
 angler, studious line cane,
 mighty fish draws panting shore:
 less ease barbed javelin bore
 gaping dastard; spear shook,
 fell, life heartless breast forsook.
 
next eryalus flies; stone,
 large rock, fury thrown:
 full crown ponderous fragment flew,
 burst helm, cleft head two:
 prone ground breathless warrior fell,
 death involved shades hell.
 low dust epaltes, echius, lie;
 ipheas, evippus, polymelus, die;
 amphoterus erymas succeed;
 last tlepolemus pyres bleed.
 where’er moves, growing slaughters spread
 heaps heaps monument dead.
 
now sarpedon brave friends beheld
 grovelling dust, gasping field,
 reproach flying host warms:
 “oh stain honour! oh disgrace arms!
 forsake, inglorious, contended plain;
 hand unaided shall war sustain:
 task mine hero’s strength try,
 mows whole troops, makes army fly.”
 
spake: and, speaking, leaps car:
 patroclus lights, sternly waits war.
 two vultures mountain’s height
 stoop resounding pinions fight;
 cuff, tear, raise screaming cry;
 desert echoes, rocks reply:
 warriors thus opposed arms, engage
 equal clamours, equal rage.
 
jove view’d combat: whose event foreseen,
 thus bespoke sister queen:
 “the hour draws on; destinies ordain,[245]
 godlike shall press phrygian plain:
 already verge death stands,
 life owed fierce patroclus’ hands,
 passions parent’s breast debate!
 say, shall snatch impending fate,
 send safe lycia, distant far
 dangers toils war;
 doom bravest offspring yield,
 fatten, celestial blood, field?”
 
thus goddess radiant eyes:
 “what words these, sovereign skies!
 short date prescribed mortal man;
 shall jove one extend narrow span,
 whose bounds fix’d race began?
 many sons gods, foredoom’d death,
 proud ilion must resign breath!
 thine exempt, debate rise above,
 murmuring powers condemn partial jove.
 give bold chief glorious fate fight;
 ascending soul wing’d flight,
 let sleep death convey, thy command,
 breathless body native land.
 friends people, future praise,
 marble tomb pyramid shall raise,
 lasting honours ashes give;
 fame (’tis dead can have) shall live.”
 
said: cloud-compeller, overcome,
 assents fate, ratifies doom.
 touch’d grief, weeping heavens distill’d
 shower blood o’er fatal field:
 god, eyes averting plain,
 laments son, predestined slain,
 far lycian shores, happy native reign.
 now met arms, combatants appear;
 heaved shield, poised lifted spear;
 strong patroclus’ hand javelin fled,
 pass’d groin valiant thrasymed;
 nerves unbraced bulk sustain,
 falls, falling bites bloody plain.
 two sounding darts lycian leader threw:
 first aloof erring fury flew,
 next transpierced achilles’ mortal steed,
 generous pedasus theban breed:
 fix’d shoulder’s joint, reel’d around,
 roll’d bloody dust, paw’d slippery ground.
 sudden fall entangled harness broke;
 axle crackled, chariot shook:
 bold automedon, disengage
 starting coursers, restrain rage,
 divides traces sword, freed
 encumbered chariot dying steed:
 rest move on, obedient rein:
 car rolls slowly o’er dusty plain.
 
towering chiefs fiercer fight advance:
 first sarpedon whirl’d weighty lance,
 o’er warrior’s shoulder took course,
 spent empty air dying force.
 patroclus’ never-erring dart;
 aim’d breast pierced mortal part,
 strong fibres bind solid heart.
 mountain oak, poplar tall,
 pine (fit mast great admiral)
 nods axe, till groaning sound
 sinks, spreads honours ground,
 thus fell king; laid earth supine,
 chariot stretch’d form divine:
 grasp’d dust distain’d streaming gore,
 and, pale death, lay groaning shore.
 lies bull beneath lion’s paws,
 grim savage grinds foamy jaws
 trembling limbs, sucks smoking blood;
 deep groans, hollow roars, rebellow wood.
 
leader lycian band
 dying chief address’d last command;
 “glaucus, bold; thy task first dare
 glorious dangers destructive war,
 lead troops, combat head,
 incite living, supply dead.
 tell them, charged latest breath
 unrevenged bear sarpedon’s death.
 grief, shame, must glaucus undergo,

 friend, warrior fight;
 defend body, conquer right:
 that, taught great examples, may try
 like thee vanquish, like die.”
 ceased; fates suppress’d labouring breath,
 eyes darken’d shades death.
 insulting victor disdain bestrode
 prostrate prince, bosom trod;
 drew weapon panting heart,
 reeking fibres clinging dart;
 wide wound gush’d stream blood,
 soul issued purple flood.
 flying steeds myrmidons detain,
 unguided now, mighty master slain.
 all-impotent aid, transfix’d grief,
 unhappy glaucus heard dying chief:
 painful arm, yet useless smart
 inflicted late teucer’s deadly dart,
 supported better hand stay’d:
 phœbus (’twas could) pray’d:
 
“all-seeing monarch! whether lycia’s coast,
 sacred ilion, thy bright presence boast,
 powerful alike ease wretch’s smart;
 hear me! god every healing art!
 lo! stiff clotted blood, pierced pain,
 thrills arm, shoots every vein,
 stand unable sustain spear,
 sigh, distance glorious war.
 low dust great sarpedon laid,
 jove vouchsafed hapless offspring aid;
 thou, god health! thy succour lend,
 guard relics slaughter’d friend:
 thou, though distant, canst restore might,
 head lycians, support fight.”
 
apollo heard; and, suppliant stood,
 heavenly hand restrain’d flux blood;
 drew dolours wounded part,
 breathed spirit rising heart.
 renew’d art divine, hero stands,
 owns assistance immortal hands.
 first fight native troops warms,
 loudly calls troy’s vindictive arms;
 ample strides stalks place place;
 now fires agenor, now polydamas:
 Æneas next, hector accosts;
 inflaming thus rage hosts.
 
“what thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?
 oh forgetful friends troy!
 generous friends, who, country far,
 breathe brave souls another’s war.
 see! dust great sarpedon lies,
 action valiant, council wise,
 guarded right, kept people free;
 lycians lost, lost thee!
 stretch’d patroclus’ arm yonder plains,
 save hostile rage loved remains!
 ah let greece conquer’d trophies boast,
 corse revenge heroes lost!”
 
spoke: leader grief partook:
 troy, loss, legions shook.
 transfix’d deep regret, view o’erthrown
 country’s pillar, own;
 chief, led troy’s beleaguer’d wall
 host heroes, outshined all.
 fired, rush on; first hector seeks foes,
 superior vengeance greatly glows.
 
o’er dead fierce patroclus stands,
 rousing ajax, roused listening bands:
 
“heroes, men; before;
 weigh great occasion, more.
 chief taught lofty walls yield,
 lies pale death, extended field.
 guard body troy numbers flies;
 ’tis half glory maintain prize.
 haste, strip arms, slaughter round spread,
 send living lycians dead.”
 
heroes kindle fierce command;
 martial squadrons close either hand:
 troy lycia charge loud alarms,
 thessalia there, greece, oppose arms.
 horrid shouts circle round slain;
 clash armour rings o’er plain.
 great jove, swell horrors fight,
 o’er fierce armies pours pernicious night,
 round confounds warring hosts,
 fate ennobling crowd ghosts.
 
now greece gives way, great epigeus falls;
 agacleus’ son, budium’s lofty walls;
 chased murder thence suppliant came
 peleus, silver-footed dame;
 now sent troy, achilles’ arms aid,
 pays due vengeance kinsman’s shade.
 soon luckless hand touch’d dead,
 rock’s large fragment thunder’d head;
 hurl’d hectorean force cleft twain
 shatter’d helm, stretch’d o’er slain.
 
fierce fight patroclus came,
 and, like eagle darting game,
 sprung trojan lycian band.
 grief thy heart, fury urged thy hand,
 generous greek! full vigour thrown,
 sthenelaus flew weighty stone,
 sunk dead: troy, near
 arm, drew back; hector learn’d fear.
 far able hand lance can throw,
 lists, fighting foe;
 far trojans lines retired;
 till glaucus, turning, rest inspired.
 bathyclaeus fell beneath rage,
 hope chalcon’s trembling age;
 wide o’er land stretch’d large domain,
 stately seats, riches blest vain:
 him, bold youth, eager pursue
 flying lycians, glaucus met slew;
 pierced bosom sudden wound,
 fell, falling made fields resound.
 achaians sorrow heroes slain;
 conquering shouts trojans shake plain,
 crowd spoil dead: greeks oppose;
 iron circle round carcase grows.
 
brave laogonus resign’d breath,
 despatch’d merion shades death:
 ida’s holy hill made abode,
 priest jove, honour’d like god.
 jaw ear javelin went;
 soul, exhaling, issued vent.
 spear Æneas victor threw,
 stooping forward death withdrew;
 lance hiss’d harmless o’er covering shield,
 trembling struck, rooted field;
 yet scarce spent, quivers plain,
 sent great Æneas’ arm vain.
 “swift thou art (the raging hero cries)
 skill’d dancing dispute prize,
 spear, destined passage found,
 fix’d thy active vigour ground.”
 
“o valiant leader dardan host!
 (insulted merion thus retorts boast)
 strong are, ’tis mortal force trust,
 arm strong may stretch thee dust.
 lance thy fate given,
 vain thy vaunts; success still heaven:
 this, instant, sends thee pluto’s coast;
 mine glory, thy parting ghost.”
 
“o friend (menoetius’ answer gave)
 words combat, ill befits brave;
 empty boasts sons troy repel,
 swords must plunge shades hell.
 speak, beseems council; dare
 glorious action, task war.”
 
said, patroclus battle flies;
 great merion follows, new shouts arise:
 shields, helmets rattle, warriors close;
 thick heavy sounds storm blows.
 shrilling vale, mountain ground,
 labours woodman’s axe resound;
 blows following blows heard re-echoing wide,
 crackling forests fall every side:
 thus echoed fields loud alarms,
 fell warriors, rung arms.
 
now great sarpedon sandy shore,
 heavenly form defaced dust gore,
 stuck darts warring heroes shed,
 lies undistinguish’d vulgar dead.
 long-disputed corse chiefs enclose,
 every side busy combat grows;
 thick beneath shepherd’s thatch’d abode
 (the pails high foaming milky flood)
 buzzing flies, persevering train,
 incessant swarm, chased return again.
 
jove view’d combat stern survey,
 eyes flash’d intolerable day.
 fix’d field sight, breast debates
 vengeance due, meditates fates:
 whether urge prompt effect, call
 force hector patroclus’ fall,
 instant see short-lived trophies won,
 stretch breathless slaughter’d son;
 yet, many soul’s untimely flight,
 augment fame horror fight.
 crown achilles’ valiant friend praise
 length dooms; and, last days
 shall set glory, bids drive foe;
 unattended see shades below.
 hector’s mind fills dire dismay;
 mounts car, calls hosts away;
 sunk troy’s heavy fates, sees decline
 scales jove, pants awe divine.
 
then, before, hardy lycians fled,
 left monarch common dead:
 around, heaps heaps, dreadful wall
 carnage rises, heroes fall.
 (so jove decreed!) length greeks obtain
 prize contested, despoil slain.
 radiant arms patroclus borne;
 patroclus’ ships glorious spoils adorn.
 
thus phœbus, realms above,
 spoke throne cloud-compelling jove:
 “descend, phœbus! phrygian plain,
 fight convey sarpedon slain;
 bathe body crystal flood,
 dust dishonour’d, deform’d blood;
 o’er limbs ambrosial odours shed,
 celestial robes adorn dead.
 rites discharged, sacred corse bequeath
 soft arms silent sleep death.
 friends immortal charge shall bear;
 friends tomb pyramid shall rear:
 honour mortals death receive,
 unavailing honours may give!”
 

[illustration: ] sleep death conveying body sarpedon to
 lycia
 

apollo bows, mount ida’s height,
 swift field precipitates flight;
 thence war breathless hero bore,
 veil’d cloud, silver simois’ shore;
 bathed honourable wounds, dress’d
 manly members immortal vest;
 perfumes sweet ambrosial dews
 restores freshness, form renews.
 sleep death, two twins winged race,
 matchless swiftness, silent pace,
 received sarpedon, god’s command,
 moment reach’d lycian land;
 corse amidst weeping friends laid,
 endless honours wait sacred shade.
 
meanwhile patroclus pours along plains,
 foaming coursers, loosen’d reins.
 fierce trojan lycian crew,
 ah blind fate! thy headlong fury flew:
 fate powerful jove ordain,
 vain thy friend’s command, thy courage vain.
 he, god, whose counsels uncontroll’d
 dismay mighty, confound bold;
 god gives, resumes, orders all,
 urged thee on, urged thee fall.
 
first, brave hero! arm slain,
 last beneath thy vengeance press’d plain;
 heaven thy fatal fury led,
 call’d fill number dead?
 adrestus first; autonous succeeds;
 echeclus follows; next young megas bleeds,
 epistor, melanippus, bite ground;
 slaughter, elasus mulius crown’d:
 sunk pylartes eternal night;
 rest, dispersing, trust fates flight.
 
now troy stoop’d beneath matchless power,
 flaming phœbus kept sacred tower.
 thrice battlements patroclus strook;[246]
 blazing ægis thrice apollo shook;
 tried fourth; when, bursting cloud,
 mortal voice heard aloud.
 
“patroclus! cease; heaven-defended wall
 defies thy lance; fated yet fall;
 thy friend, thy greater far, shall withstand,
 troy shall stoop even achilles’ hand.”
 
spoke god darts celestial fires;
 greek obeys him, awe retires.
 hector, checking scæan gates
 panting coursers, breast debates,
 field forces employ,
 draw troops within walls troy.
 thus thought, beside phœbus stood,
 asius’ shape, reigned sangar’s flood;
 (thy brother, hecuba! dymas sprung,
 valiant warrior, haughty, bold, young;)
 thus accosts him. “what shameful sight!
 god! hector forbears fight?
 thine vigour successful spear
 soon convince thee false fear.
 turn thee, ah turn thee field fame,
 patroclus’ blood efface thy shame.
 perhaps apollo shall thy arms succeed,
 heaven ordains thy lance bleed.”
 
spoke inspiring god; took flight,
 plunged amidst tumult fight.
 bids cebrion drive rapid car;
 lash resounds, coursers rush war.
 god grecians’ sinking souls depress’d,
 pour’d swift spirits trojan breast.
 patroclus lights, impatient fight;
 spear left, stone employs right:
 nerves drives foe.
 pointed above, rough gross below:
 falling ruin crush’d cebrion’s head,
 lawless offspring king priam’s bed;
 front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish’d wound:
 bursting balls drop sightless ground.
 charioteer, yet held rein,
 struck car, falls headlong plain.
 dark shades soul unwilling glides,
 proud victor thus fall derides.
 
“good heaven! active feats yon artist shows!
 skilful divers phrygian foes!
 mark ease sink sand!
 pity practice land!”
 
rushing sudden prostrate prize,
 spoil carcase fierce patroclus flies:
 swift lion, terrible bold,
 sweeps field, depopulates fold;
 pierced dauntless heart, tumbles slain,
 fatal courage finds bane.
 bold hector leaping car,
 defends body, provokes war.
 thus slaughter’d hind, equal rage,
 two lordly rulers wood engage;
 stung fierce hunger, prey invades,
 echoing roars rebellow shades.
 stern hector fastens warrior’s head,
 foot patroclus drags dead:
 around, confusion, rage, fright,
 mix contending hosts mortal fight.
 pent hills, wild winds roar aloud
 deep bosom gloomy wood;
 leaves, arms, trees, aloft air blown,
 broad oaks crackle, sylvans groan;
 way that, rattling thicket bends,
 whole forest one crash descends.
 less noise, less tumultuous rage,
 dreadful shock mingled hosts engage.
 darts shower’d darts, now round carcase ring;
 now flights arrows bounding string:
 stones follow stones; clatter fields,
 hard, heavy, shake sounding shields.
 rising whirlwind clouds plains,
 sunk soft dust mighty chief remains,
 and, stretch’d death, forgets guiding reins!
 
now flaming zenith, sol driven
 fervid orb half vault heaven;
 host equal tempests fell
 showering darts, numbers sank hell.
 evening wheels o’erhung main,
 glad conquest rested grecian train.
 amidst tumult alarms,
 draw conquer’d corse radiant arms.
 rash patroclus new fury glows,
 breathing slaughter, pours amid foes.
 thrice press like mars flew,
 thrice three heroes onset slew.
 ends thy glory! fates untwine
 last, black remnant bright line:
 apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;
 death calls, heaven allows longer day!
 
lo! god dusky clouds enshrined,
 approaching dealt staggering blow behind.
 weighty shock neck shoulders feel;
 eyes flash sparkles, stunn’d senses reel
 giddy darkness; far distance flung,
 bounding helmet champaign rung.
 achilles’ plume stain’d dust gore;
 plume never stoop’d earth before;
 long used, untouch’d, fighting fields shine,
 shade temples mad divine.
 jove dooms now hector’s helm nod;
 long—for fate pursues him, god.
 
spear shivers falls; ample shield
 drops arm: baldric strows field:
 corslet astonish’d breast forsakes:
 loose joint; nerve horror shakes;
 stupid stares, all-assistless stands:
 force mortal hands!
 
dardan youth was, well known fame,
 panthus sprung, euphorbus name;
 famed manage foaming horse,
 skill’d dart, matchless course:
 full twenty knights tumbled car,
 yet learn’d rudiments war.
 venturous spear first drew hero’s gore;
 struck, wounded, durst more.
 nor, though disarm’d, patroclus’ fury stood:
 swift withdrew long-protended wood.
 turn’d short, herded crowd.
 thus, arm divine, mortal spear,
 wounded, once, patroclus yields fear,
 retires succour social train,
 flies fate, heaven decreed, vain.
 stern hector, bleeding chief views,
 breaks ranks, retreat pursues:
 lance arrests mortal wound;
 falls, earth thunders, arms resound.
 greece sunk; moment all
 yet-surviving heroes seem’d fall.
 so, scorch’d heat, along desert score,
 roaming lion meets bristly boar,
 fast spring; dispute flood,
 flaming eyes, jaws besmear’d blood;
 length sovereign savage wins strife;
 torn boar resigns thirst life.
 patroclus thus, many chiefs o’erthrown,
 many lives effused, expires own.
 dying now hector’s feet lies,
 sternly views him, triumphant cries:
 
“lie there, patroclus! thee, joy
 thy pride promised, subverting troy;
 fancied scenes ilion wrapt flames,
 thy soft pleasures served captive dames.
 unthinking man! fought towers free,
 guard beauteous race lords like thee:
 thou prey vultures shalt made;
 thy achilles lend thee aid;
 though much parting great chief might say,
 much enjoin thee, important day.
 
‘return not, brave friend (perhaps said),
 without bloody arms hector dead.’
 spoke, patroclus march’d, thus sped.”
 
supine, wildly gazing skies,
 faint, expiring breath, chief replies:
 
“vain boaster! cease, know powers divine!
 jove’s apollo’s deed, thine;
 heaven owed whate’er call,
 heaven disarm’d ere fall.
 twenty mortals, thy match might,
 opposed fairly, sunk fight:
 fate phœbus first o’erthrown,
 euphorbus next; third mean part thy own.
 thou, imperious! hear latest breath;
 gods inspire it, sounds thy death:
 insulting man, thou shalt soon i;
 black fate o’erhangs thee, thy hour draws nigh;
 even now life’s last verge see thee stand,
 see thee fall, achilles’ hand.”
 
faints: soul unwilling wings way,
 (the beauteous body left load clay)
 flits lone, uncomfortable coast;
 naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!
 
hector pausing, eyes fed
 pale carcase, thus address’d dead:
 
“from whence boding speech, stern decree
 death denounced, denounced me?
 well achilles’ fate given
 hector’s lance? knows will heaven?”
 
pensive said; pressing lay
 breathless bosom, tore lance away;
 upwards cast corse: reeking spear
 shakes, charges bold charioteer.
 swift automedon loosen’d reins
 rapt chariot o’er distant plains,
 far rage immortal coursers drove;
 immortal coursers gift jove.

seventh battle, body patroclus.—the acts menelaus.
 

menelaus, upon death patroclus, defends body enemy:
 euphorbus, attempts it, slain. hector advancing, menelaus
 retires; soon returns ajax, drives off. this, glaucus
 objects hector flight, thereupon puts armour had
 won patroclus, renews battle. greeks give way, till
 ajax rallies them: Æneas sustains trojans. Æneas hector attempt
 chariot achilles, borne automedon. horses of
 achilles deplore loss patroclus: jupiter covers body a
 thick darkness: noble prayer ajax occasion. menelaus
 sends antilochus achilles, news patroclus’ death: then
 returns fight, where, though attacked utmost fury, he
 meriones, assisted ajaces, bear body ships.
 time evening eight-and-twentieth day. scene
 lies fields troy.
 

cold earth divine patroclus spread,
 lies pierced wounds among vulgar dead.
 great menelaus, touch’d generous woe,
 springs front, guards foe.
 thus round new-fallen young heifer moves,
 fruit throes, first-born loves;
 anxious (helpless lies, bare)
 turns, re-turns her, mother’s care,
 opposed near carcase came,
 broad shield glimmers, lances flame.
 
panthus, skill’d dart send,
 eyes dead hero, insults friend.
 “this hand, atrides, laid patroclus low;
 warrior! desist, tempt equal blow:
 spoils prowess won, resign:
 depart life, leave glory mine.”
 
trojan thus: spartan monarch burn’d
 generous anguish, scorn return’d:
 “laugh’st thou not, jove! thy superior throne,
 mortals boast prowess own?
 thus lion glories might,
 panther braves spotted foe fight,
 thus boar (those terrors plain;)
 man vaunts force, vaunts vain.
 far vainest boastful kind,
 sons panthus vent haughty mind.
 yet ’twas late, beneath conquering steel
 boaster’s brother, hyperenor, fell;
 arm rashly defied,
 vain vigour, vain pride.
 eyes beheld dust expire,
 cheer spouse, glad sire.
 presumptuous youth! like shall thy doom,
 go, wait thy brother stygian gloom;
 or, thou may’st, avoid threaten’d fate;
 fools stay feel it, wise late.”
 
unmoved, euphorbus thus: “that action known,
 come, brother’s blood repay thy own.
 weeping father claims thy destined head,
 spouse, widow bridal bed.
 thy conquer’d spoils shall bestow,
 soothe consort’s parent’s woe.
 longer defer glorious strife,
 let heaven decide fortune, fame, life.”
 
swift word missile lance flings;
 well-aim’d weapon buckler rings,
 blunted brass, innoxious falls.
 jove father great atrides calls,
 flies javelin arm vain,
 pierced throat, bent plain;
 wide neck appears grisly wound,
 prone sinks warrior, arms resound.
 shining circlets golden hair,
 even graces might proud wear,
 instarr’d gems gold, bestrow shore,
 dust dishonour’d, deform’d gore.
 
young olive, sylvan scene,
 crown’d fresh fountains eternal green,
 lifts gay head, snowy flowerets fair,
 plays dances gentle air;
 lo! whirlwind high heaven invades
 tender plant, withers shades;
 lies uprooted genial bed,
 lovely ruin now defaced dead:
 thus young, thus beautiful, euphorbus lay,
 fierce spartan tore arms away.
 proud deed, glorious prize,
 affrighted troy towering victor flies:
 flies, mountain lion’s ire
 village curs trembling swains retire,
 o’er slaughter’d bull hear roar,
 see jaws distil smoking gore:
 pale fear, distance scatter’d round,
 shout incessant, vales resound.
 
meanwhile apollo view’d envious eyes,
 urged great hector dispute prize;
 (in mentes’ shape, beneath whose martial care
 rough ciconians learn’d trade war;)[247]
 “forbear (he cried) fruitless speed chase
 achilles’ coursers, ethereal race;
 stoop not, these, mortal man’s command,
 stoop none great achilles’ hand.
 long amused pursuit vain,
 turn, behold brave euphorbus slain;
 sparta slain! ever now suppress’d
 fire burn’d undaunted breast!”
 
thus spoke, apollo wing’d flight,
 mix’d mortals toils fight:
 words infix’d unutterable care
 deep great hector’s soul: war
 darts anxious eye; and, instant, view’d
 breathless hero blood imbued,
 (forth welling wound, prone lay)
 victor’s hands shining prey.
 sheath’d bright arms, cleaving ranks flies,
 sends voice thunder skies:
 fierce flood flame vulcan sent,
 flew, fired nations went.
 atrides voice storm divined,
 thus explored unconquer’d mind:
 
“then shall quit patroclus plain,
 slain cause, honour slain!
 desert arms, relics, friend?
 singly, hector troops attend?
 sure partial favour heaven bestow’d,
 brave hero brave god:
 forgive me, greece, quit field;
 ’tis hector, heaven yield.
 yet, god, heaven, give fear,
 voice ajax reach ear:

 slow recedes, sighing quits dead.
 
fold unwilling lion parts,
 forced loud clamours, storm darts;
 flies indeed, threatens flies,
 heart indignant retorted eyes.
 now enter’d spartan ranks, turn’d
 manly breast, new fury burn’d;
 o’er black battalions sent view,
 cloud godlike ajax knew;
 labouring left warrior stood,
 grim arms, cover’d o’er blood;
 breathing courage, god day
 sunk heart terror dismay.
 
king: “oh ajax, oh friend!
 haste, patroclus’ loved remains defend:
 body achilles restore
 demands care; alas, can more!
 naked now, despoiled arms, lies;
 hector glories dazzling prize.”
 said, touch’d heart. raging pair
 pierced thick battle, provoke war.
 already stern hector seized head,
 doom’d trojan gods unhappy dead;
 soon ajax rear’d tower-like shield,
 sprung car, measured back field,
 train troy radiant armour bear,
 stand trophy fame war.
 
meanwhile great ajax (his broad shield display’d)
 guards dead hero dreadful shade;
 now before, now behind stood:
 thus centre gloomy wood,
 many step, lioness surrounds
 tawny young, beset men hounds;
 elate heart, rousing powers,
 dark o’er fiery balls hanging eyebrow lours.
 fast side generous spartan glows
 great revenge, feeds inward woes.
 
glaucus, leader lycian aids,
 hector frowning, thus flight upbraids:
 
“where now hector shall hector find?
 manly form, without manly mind.
 this, chief! hero’s boasted fame?
 vain, without merit, name!
 since battle renounced, thy thoughts employ
 methods may preserve thy troy:
 ’tis time try ilion’s state can stand
 thee alone, ask foreign hand:
 mean, empty boast! shall lycians stake
 lives you? lycians forsake?
 thy thankless arms can expect?
 thy friend sarpedon proves thy base neglect;
 say, shall slaughter’d bodies guard walls,
 unreveng’d great sarpedon falls?
 even died troy, left there,
 feast dogs, fowls air.
 command lycian wait,
 hence let march, give troy fate.
 spirit gods impart
 impel one trojan hand trojan heart,
 (such burn every soul draws
 sword glory, country’s cause)
 even yet mutual arms might employ,
 drag yon carcase walls troy.
 oh! patroclus ours, might obtain
 sarpedon’s arms honour’d corse again!
 greece achilles’ friend repaid,
 thus due honours purchased shade.
 words vain—let ajax appear,
 hector trembles recedes fear;
 thou dar’st meet terrors eye;
 lo! already thou prepar’st fly.”
 
trojan chief fix’d resentment eyed
 lycian leader, sedate replied:
 
“say, just, friend, hector’s ear
 warrior speech hear?
 deem’d thee wisest thy kind,
 ill insult suits prudent mind.
 shun great ajax? desert train?
 ’tis mine prove rash assertion vain;
 joy mingle battle bleeds,
 hear thunder sounding steeds.
 jove’s high will ever uncontroll’d,
 strong withers, confounds bold;
 now crowns fame mighty man, now
 strikes fresh garland victor’s brow!
 come, yon squadrons let us hew way,
 thou witness, fear to-day;
 yet greek sight hector dread,
 yet hero dare defend dead.”
 
turning martial hosts, cries:
 “ye trojans, dardans, lycians, allies!
 men, friends, action name,
 yet mindful ancient fame.
 hector proud achilles’ arms shall shine,
 torn friend, right conquest mine.”
 
strode along field, thus said:
 (the sable plumage nodded o’er head:)
 swift spacious plain sent look;
 one instant saw, one instant overtook
 distant band, sandy shore
 radiant spoils sacred ilion bore.
 mail unbraced field bestrow’d;
 train troy convey’d massy load.
 now blazing immortal arms stands;
 work present celestial hands;
 aged peleus achilles given,
 first peleus court heaven:
 father’s arms long achilles wears,
 forbid fate reach father’s years.
 
him, proud triumph, glittering afar,
 god whose thunder rends troubled air
 beheld pity; apart sat,
 and, conscious, look’d scene fate.
 shook sacred honours head;
 olympus trembled, godhead said;
 “ah, wretched man! unmindful thy end!
 moment’s glory; fates attend!
 heavenly panoply divinely bright
 thou stand’st, armies tremble thy sight,
 achilles’ self! beneath thy dart
 lies slain great achilles’ dearer part.
 thou mighty dead arms hast torn,
 greatest mankind worn.
 yet live! give thee one illustrious day,
 blaze glory ere thou fad’st away.
 ah! andromache shall come
 joyful tears welcome hector home;
 officious, endearing charms,
 thy tired limbs unbrace pelides’ arms!”
 
sable brow gave nod
 seals word; sanction god.
 stubborn arms (by jove’s command disposed)
 conform’d spontaneous, around closed:
 fill’d god, enlarged members grew,
 veins sudden vigour flew,
 blood brisker tides began roll,
 mars came rushing soul.

“hear, ye hosts, hear, unnumber’d bands
 neighbouring nations, distant lands!
 ’twas state summon’d far,

 ye came fight; valiant foe chase,

 now then, conquer die prepare;
 die conquer terms war.
 whatever hand shall win patroclus slain,
 whoe’er shall drag trojan train,
 hector’s self shall equal honours claim;
 hector part spoil, share fame.”
 
fired words, troops dismiss fears,
 join, thicken, protend spears;
 full greeks drive firm array,
 ajax hopes glorious prey:
 vain hope! numbers shall field o’erspread,
 victims perish round mighty dead!
 
great ajax mark’d growing storm far,
 thus bespoke brother war:
 “our fatal day, alas! come, friend;
 wars glories end!
 ’tis corse alone guard vain,
 condemn’d vultures trojan plain;
 must yield: sad fate must fall
 thee, me, perhaps, friend, all.
 see tempest direful hector spreads,
 lo! bursts, thunders heads!
 call greeks, hear call,
 bravest greeks: hour demands all.”
 
warrior raised voice, wide around
 field re-echoed distressful sound.
 “o chiefs! princes, whose hand given
 rule men; whose glory heaven!
 due honours atrides grace:
 ye guides guardians argive race!
 all, well-known voice shall reach far,
 all, see cloud war;
 come all! let generous rage arms employ,
 save patroclus dogs troy.”
 
oilean ajax first voice obey’d,
 swift pace, ready aid:
 next idomeneus, slow age,
 merion, burning hero’s rage.

 greeks, eager fame.
 fierce charge great hector led throng;
 whole troy embodied rush’d shouts along.
 thus, mountain billow foams raves,

 deep transpiercing shoulder stood;
 clanging arms hero fell all
 fields resounded weighty fall.
 
phorcys, slain hippothous defends,
 telamonian lance belly rends;
 hollow armour burst stroke,
 wound rushing entrails broke:
 strong convulsions panting sands
 lies, grasps dust dying hands.
 
struck sight, recede trojan train:
 shouting argives strip heroes slain.
 now troy, greece compell’d yield,
 fled ramparts, resign’d field;
 greece, native fortitude elate,
 jove averse, turn’d scale fate:
 phœbus urged Æneas fight;
 seem’d like aged periphas sight:
 (a herald anchises’ love grown old,
 revered prudence, prudence bold.)
 
thus he—“what methods yet, chief! remain,
 save troy, though heaven fall ordain?
 heroes, who, virtuous care,
 valour, numbers, arts war,
 forced powers spare sinking state,
 gain’d length glorious odds fate:
 you, fortune smiles, jove declares
 partial favour, assists wars,
 shameful efforts ’gainst employ,
 force unwilling god ruin troy.”
 
Æneas form assumed descries
 power conceal’d, thus hector cries:
 “oh lasting shame! fears prey,
 seek ramparts, desert day.
 god, less, bosom warms,
 tells me, jove asserts trojan arms.”
 
spoke, foremost combat flew:
 bold example hosts pursue.
 then, first, leocritus beneath bled,
 vain beloved valiant lycomede;
 view’d fall, and, grieving chance,
 swift revenge sent angry lance;
 whirling lance, vigorous force address’d,
 descends, pants apisaon’s breast;
 rich paeonia’s vales warrior came,
 next thee, asteropeus! place fame.
 asteropeus grief beheld slain,
 rush’d combat, rush’d vain:
 indissolubly firm, around dead,
 rank within rank, buckler buckler spread,
 hemm’d bristled spears, grecians stood,
 brazen bulwark, iron wood.
 great ajax eyes incessant care,
 orb contracts crowded war,
 close ranks commands fight fall,
 stands centre soul all:
 fix’d spot war, wounded, wound;
 sanguine torrent steeps reeking ground:
 heaps greeks, heaps trojans bled,
 and, thickening round them, rise hills dead.
 
greece, close order, collected might,
 yet suffers least, sways wavering fight;
 fierce conflicting fires combat burns,
 now rises, now sinks turns.
 one thick darkness fight lost;
 sun, moon, ethereal host
 seem’d extinct: day ravish’d eyes,
 heaven’s splendours blotted skies.
 o’er patroclus’ body hung night,
 rest sunshine fought, open light;
 unclouded there, aerial azure spread,
 vapour rested mountain’s head,
 golden sun pour’d forth stronger ray,
 broad expansion flamed day.
 dispersed around plain, fits fight,
 scatter’d arrows light:
 death darkness o’er carcase spread,
 burn’d war, mighty bled.
 
meanwhile sons nestor, rear,
 (their fellows routed,) toss distant spear,
 skirmish wide: nestor gave command,
 ships sent pylian band.
 youthful brothers thus fame contend,
 knew fortune achilles’ friend;
 thought view’d still, martial joy,
 glorious arms, dealing death troy.
 
round corse heroes pant breath,
 thick heavy grows work death:
 o’erlabour’d now, dust, sweat, gore,
 knees, legs, feet, covered o’er;
 drops follow drops, clouds clouds arise,
 carnage clogs hands, darkness fills eyes.
 slaughter’d bull’s yet reeking hide,
 strain’d full force, tugg’d side side,
 brawny curriers stretch; labour o’er
 extended surface, drunk fat gore:
 tugging round corse armies stood;
 mangled body bathed sweat blood;
 greeks ilians equal strength employ,
 now ships force it, now troy.
 pallas’ self, breast fury warms,
 whose anger sets world arms,
 blame scene; rage, horror reign’d;
 such, jove honour great dead ordain’d.
 
achilles ships distance lay,

 wish’d return prepares vain;
 though well knew, make proud ilion bend
 heaven destined friend.
 perhaps him: thetis reveal’d;
 rest, pity son, conceal’d.
 
still raged conflict round hero dead,
 heaps heaps mutual wounds bled.
 “cursed man (even private greeks say)
 dares desert well-disputed day!
 first may cleaving earth eyes
 gape wide, drink blood sacrifice;
 first perish all, ere haughty troy shall boast
 lost patroclus, glory lost!”
 
thus they: one voice trojans said,
 “grant day, jove! heap us dead!”
 
clash sounding arms; clangours rise,
 shake brazen concave skies.
 
meantime, distance scene blood,
 pensive steeds great achilles stood:
 godlike master slain eyes,
 wept, shared human miseries.[248]
 vain automedon now shakes rein,
 now plies lash, soothes threats vain;
 fight hellespont go,

 marble courser sculptor’s hands,
 placed hero’s grave. along face
 big round drops coursed silent pace,
 conglobing dust. manes, late
 circled arched necks, waved state,
 trail’d dust beneath yoke spread,

 jove disdain’d cast pitying look,
 thus relenting steeds spoke:
 
“unhappy coursers immortal strain,

 race mortal man bestow,
 only, alas! share mortal woe?
 ah! inferior birth,

 wretched creature wretched kind,

 miserable race! cease mourn:

 automedon rapid flight shall bear

 high manes shake dust, bear
 kindling chariot parted war:

 danger now swiftest speed flew,
 now conquest like speed pursue;

 now plies javelin, now directs reins:
 brave alcimedon beheld distress’d,

“what god provokes thee rashly thus dare,
 alone, unaided, thickest war?
 alas! thy friend slain, hector wields
 achilles’ arms triumphant fields.”
 
“in happy time (the charioteer replies)
 bold alcimedon now greets eyes;
 greek like heavenly steeds restrains,
 holds fury suspended reins:
 patroclus, lived, rage tame,
 now patroclus empty name!
 thee yield seat, thee resign
 ruling charge: task fight mine.”
 
said. alcimedon, active heat,
 snatches reins, vaults seat.

 call’d Æneas fighting near side.
 
“lo, sight, beyond hope restored,
 achilles’ car, deserted lord!
 glorious steeds ready arms invite,
 scarce weak drivers guide fight.

 unite thy force, friend, prevail.”
 
venus counsel yields;
 o’er backs spread solid shields:
 brass refulgent broad surface shined,
 thick bull-hides spacious concave lined.

 vain advance! fated return.
 
unmov’d, automedon attends fight,

 “oh keep foaming coursers close behind!
 full shoulders let nostrils blow,

 pierced belt, emboss’d curious art,

 ponderous axe, descending full,
 cleaves broad forehead brawny bull:[249]

 tumbling rolls enormous ground:
 thus fell youth; air soul received,
 spear trembled entrails heaved.
 
now automedon trojan foe
 discharged lance; meditated blow,
 stooping, shunn’d; javelin idly fled,
 hiss’d innoxious o’er hero’s head;
 deep rooted ground, forceful spear
 long vibrations spent fury there.
 clashing falchions now chiefs closed,
 brave ajax heard, interposed;
 longer hector trojans stood,
 left slain companion blood:

 “accept, patroclus, mean sacrifice:
 thus soothed griefs, thus paid,

looks lion o’er mangled boar,
 grim rage, horrible gore;

trembled greece: flight peneleus led;
 brave bœotian turn’d head

 hector wounded, leitus quits plain,

hector follow’d, idomen address’d
 flaming javelin manly breast;

 exulting troy clamour fills fields:
 high chariots cretan stood,

 martial merion: coeranus name,

 foot bold merion fought; now laid low,

 deserted god, yet let us try
 human strength prudence can supply;
 yet honour’d corse, triumph borne,

 tremble yet, scarce rescued fates,
 still hear hector thundering gates.
 hero must despatch’d bear

 chief spy host:

 general darkness—lord earth air!
 oh king! oh father! hear humble prayer:
 dispel cloud, light heaven restore;

 let us perish face day!”
 
tears hero spoke, prayer
 god relenting clear’d clouded air;
 forth burst sun all-enlightening ray;

 “now, now, atrides! cast around thy sight;
 yet antilochus survives fight,
 let great achilles’ ear convey

turns lion nightly fold,
 though high courage, hunger bold,
 long gall’d herdsmen, long vex’d hounds,
 stiff fatigue, fretted sore wounds;
 darts fly round hundred hands,
 red terrors blazing brands:
 till late, reluctant, dawn day
 sour departs, quits untasted prey,
 moved atrides dangerous place
 weary limbs, unwilling pace;
 foe, fear’d, might yet patroclus gain,
 much admonish’d, much adjured train:
 
“o guard relics charge consign’d,
 bear merits dead mind;
 skill’d obliging art;
 mildest manners, gentlest heart:
 was, alas! fate decreed end,
 death hero, life friend!”
 
parts chief; rank rank flew,
 round sides sent piercing view.
 bold bird, endued sharpest eye
 wings mid aërial sky,
 sacred eagle, walks above

 stoops, sousing quivering hare,
 snatches life amid clouds air.
 less quickness, exerted sight
 pass’d way, ranks fight:
 till left chief sought, found,
 cheering men, spreading deaths around:
 
king: “beloved jove! draw near,
 sadder tidings never touch’d thy ear;
 thy eyes witness’d fatal turn!
 ilion triumphs, achaians mourn.
 all: patroclus, shore
 now pale dead, shall succour greece more.
 fly fleet, instant fly, tell
 sad achilles, loved-one fell:
 may haste naked corse gain:
 arms hector’s, despoil’d slain.”
 
youthful warrior heard silent woe,
 fair eyes tears began flow:
 big mighty grief, strove say
 sorrow dictates, word found way.
 brave laodocus arms flung,
 who, near wheeling, drove steeds along;
 ran mournful message impart,
 tearful eyes, dejected heart.
 
swift fled youth: menelaus stands
 (though sore distress’d) aid pylian bands;
 bids bold thrasymede troops sustain;
 returns patroclus slain.
 “gone antilochus (the hero said);
 hope not, warriors, achilles’ aid:
 though fierce rage, unbounded woe,
 unarm’d, fights trojan foe.
 ’tis hands alone hopes remain,
 ’tis vigour must dead regain,
 save ourselves, impetuous hate
 troy pours along, way rolls fate.”
 
“’tis well (said ajax), thy care,
 merion’s aid, weighty corse rear;
 myself, bold brother will sustain
 shock hector charging train:
 fear armies, fighting side side;
 troy can dare, already tried,
 tried it, stood.” hero said.
 high ground warriors heave dead.
 general clamour rises sight:
 loud shout trojans, renew fight.
 fiercer rush along gloomy wood,
 rage insatiate, thirst blood,
 voracious hounds, many length before
 furious hunters, drive wounded boar;
 savage turns glaring eye,
 howl aloof, round forest fly.
 thus retreating greece trojans pour,
 wave thick falchions, javelins shower:
 ajax turning, fears yield,
 pale tremble forsake field.
 
thus aloft hero’s corse bear,
 behind rages storm war:
 confusion, tumult, horror, o’er throng
 men, steeds, chariots, urged rout along:
 less fierce winds rising flames conspire
 whelm city waves fire;
 now sink gloomy clouds proud abodes,
 now crack blazing temples gods;
 rumbling torrent ruin rolls,
 sheets smoke mount heavy poles.
 heroes sweat beneath honour’d load:
 two mules, along rugged road,
 steep mountain exerted strength
 drag vast beam, mast’s unwieldy length;
 inly groan, big drops sweat distil,
 enormous timber lumbering hill:
 these—behind, bulk ajax stands,
 breaks torrent rushing bands.
 thus river swell’d sudden rains
 spreads broad waters o’er level plains,
 interposing hill stream divides,
 breaks force, turns winding tides.
 still close follow, close rear engage;
 Æneas storms, hector foams rage:
 greece heavy, thick retreat maintains,
 wedged one body, like flight cranes,
 shriek incessant, falcon, hung
 high poised pinions, threats callow young.
 trojan chiefs grecians fly,
 wild terror, mingled cry:
 within, without trench, way,
 strow’d bright heaps, arms armour lay;
 horror jove impress’d! yet still proceeds
 work death, still battle bleeds.

 “sad tidings, peleus! thou must hear;

sudden horror shot chief,
 wrapp’d senses cloud grief;

 scorching ashes o’er graceful head;
 purple garments, golden hairs,

 hard soil groaning breast threw,

“why mourns son? thy late preferr’d request

he, deeply groaning—“to cureless grief,

 let fierce hero, then, fury calls,

 dogs shall tear ere sack town.”
 
“return! (said hector, fired stern disdain)
 what! coop whole armies walls again?
 was’t enough, ye valiant warriors, say,
 nine years imprison’d towers ye lay?

 grim savage, rifled den
 late returning, snuffs track men,

 myrmidons loud laments.
 
“in vain promise, gods! engage,

 mighty jove cuts short, just disdain,
 long, long views poor designing man!
 one fate warrior friend shall strike,
 troy’s black sands must drink blood alike:
 wretched mother shall deplore,
 aged father never see more!
 yet, patroclus! yet space stay,
 swift pursue thee darksome way.
 ere thy dear relics grave laid,
 shall hector’s head offer’d thy shade;
 that, arms, shall hang thy shrine;
 twelve, noblest trojan line,
 sacred vengeance, hand expire;
 lives effused around thy flaming pyre.
 thus let lie till then! thus, closely press’d,
 bathe thy cold face, sob upon thy breast!
 trojan captives thy mourners stay,
 weep night murmur day:
 spoils arms, thine; when, wasting wide,
 swords kept time, conquer’d side side.”

 achilles (rising midst) begun:
 
“o monarch! better far fate

 thus, rising lofty throne,

“hear me, ye sons greece! silence hear!

 let every greek, sees spear confound
 trojan ranks, deal destruction round,

peleus thus; thus replies
 great councils, ithacus wise:
 “though, godlike, thou art toils oppress’d,
 least armies claim repast rest:
 long laborious must combat be,
 gods inspired, led thee.
 strength derived spirits blood,

 boastful war, without stay,

 courage may prompt; but, ebbing strength,
 mere unsupported man must yield length;

 dismiss people, then, give command,

 let presents achilles made,

monarch: “just thy decree,

“for (the stern Æacides replies)

“o first greeks, (ulysses thus rejoin’d,)

now delegates ulysses sent,

 thias merion, thunderbolts war,
 lycomedes creiontian strain,
 melanippus, form’d chosen train.
 swift word given, youths obey’d:
 twice ten bright vases midst laid;
 row six fair tripods succeeds;
 twice number high-bounding steeds:
 seven captives next lovely line compose;
 eighth briseïs, like blooming rose,
 closed bright band: great ithacus, before,
 first train, golden talents bore:
 rest public view chiefs dispose,
 splendid scene! agamemnon rose:
 boar talthybius held: grecian lord
 drew broad cutlass sheath’d beside sword:
 stubborn bristles victim’s brow
 crops, offering meditates vow.
 hands uplifted attesting skies,
 heaven’s broad marble roof fixed eyes.
 solemn words deep attention draw,
 greece around sat thrill’d sacred awe.
 
“witness thou first! thou greatest power above,
 all-good, all-wise, all-surveying jove!
 mother-earth, heaven’s revolving light,
 ye, fell furies realms night,
 rule dead, horrid woes prepare
 perjured kings, falsely swear!
 black-eyed maid inviolate removes,

that, weapon deep inflicts wound;
 bleeding savage tumbles ground;
 sacred herald rolls victim slain
 (a feast fish) foaming main.
 
thus achilles: “hear, ye greeks! know
 whate’er feel, ’tis jove inflicts woe;
 else atrides rage inflame,
 arms, unwilling, force dame.
 ’twas jove’s high will alone, o’erruling all,
 doom’d strife, doom’d greeks fall.
 go then, ye chiefs! indulge genial rite;
 achilles waits ye, expects fight.”
 
speedy council word adjourn’d:
 black vessels greeks return’d.
 achilles sought tent. train before
 march’d onward, bending gifts bore.
 tents squires industrious spread:
 foaming coursers stalls led;
 new seats female captives move.
 briseïs, radiant queen love,
 slow pass’d, beheld sad survey
 where, gash’d cruel wounds, patroclus lay.
 prone body fell heavenly fair,
 beat sad breast, tore golden hair;
 beautiful grief, humid eyes
 shining tears lifts, thus cries:
 
“ah, youth ever dear, ever kind,
 tender friend distracted mind!
 left thee fresh life, beauty gay;
 now find thee cold, inanimated clay!
 woes wretched race life attend!
 sorrows sorrows, never doom’d end!
 first loved consort virgin bed
 eyes fatal battle bled:
 three brave brothers one mournful day
 trod dark, irremeable way:
 thy friendly hand uprear’d plain,
 dried sorrows husband slain;
 achilles’ care promised prove,
 first, dearest partner love;
 rites divine ratify band,
 make empress native land.
 accept grateful tears! thee flow,
 thee, ever felt another’s woe!”
 
sister captives echoed groan groan,
 mourn’d patroclus’ fortunes, own.
 leaders press’d chief every side;
 unmoved heard them, sighs denied.
 
“if yet achilles friend, whose care
 bent please him, request forbear;
 till yonder sun descend, ah, let pay
 grief anguish one abstemious day.”
 
spoke, warriors turn’d face:
 yet still brother-kings atreus’ race.
 nestor, idomeneus, ulysses sage,
 phœnix, strive calm grief rage:
 rage calm not, grief control;
 groans, raves, sorrows soul.
 
“thou too, patroclus! (thus heart vents)
 spread inviting banquet tents:
 thy sweet society, thy winning care,
 stay’d achilles, rushing war.
 now, alas! death’s cold arms resign’d,
 banquet revenge can glad mind?
 greater sorrow afflict breast,
 hoary peleus deceased?
 now, perhaps, phthia dreads hear

 peleus breathes vital air;
 drags wretched life age care,
 till news sad fate invades
 hastening soul, sinks shades.”
 
sighing said: grief heroes join’d,
 stole tear left behind.
 mingled grief sire heaven survey’d,
 thus pity blue-eyed maid:
 
“is achilles now thy care,
 dost thou thus desert great war?
 lo, yon sails canvas wings extend,
 comfortless sits, wails friend:
 ere thirst want forces oppress’d,
 haste infuse ambrosia breast.”
 
spoke; sudden, word jove,
 shot descending goddess above.
 swift ether shrill harpy springs,
 wide air floating ample wings,
 great achilles flight address’d,
 pour’d divine ambrosia breast,[259]
 nectar sweet, (refection gods!)
 then, swift ascending, sought bright abodes.
 
now issued ships warrior-train,
 like deluge pour’d upon plain.
 piercing blasts boreas blow,
 scatter o’er fields driving snow;
 dusky clouds fleecy winter flies,
 whose dazzling lustre whitens skies:
 helms succeeding helms, shields shields,
 catch quick beams, brighten fields;
 broad glittering breastplates, spears pointed rays,
 mix one stream, reflecting blaze blaze;
 thick beats centre coursers bound;
 splendour flame skies, laugh fields around,
 
full midst, high-towering o’er rest,
 limbs arms divine achilles dress’d;

 he, far thy better, foredoom’d die,
 thou, dost thou bewail mortality?
 seest thou me, nature’s gifts adorn,
 sprung hero, goddess born?
 day shall come (which nothing can avert)
 spear, arrow, dart,
 night, day, force, design,
 impending death certain fate mine!
 die then,”—he said; word spoke,
 fainting stripling sank stroke:
 hand forgot grasp, left spear,
 trembling frame confess’d fear:
 sudden, achilles broad sword display’d,
 buried neck reeking blade.
 prone fell youth; panting land,
 gushing purple dyed thirsty sand.
 victor stream carcase gave,
 thus insults him, floating wave:
 
“lie there, lycaon! let fish surround
 thy bloated corpse, suck thy gory wound:
 sad mother shall thy funerals weep,
 swift scamander roll thee deep,
 whose every wave watery monster brings,
 feast unpunish’d fat kings.
 perish troy, trojan line!
 ruin theirs, compassion mine.
 boots ye now scamander’s worshipp’d stream,
 earthly honours, immortal name?
 vain immolated bulls slain,
 living coursers glut gulfs vain!
 thus rewards you, bitter fate;
 thus, till grecian vengeance complete:
 thus atoned patroclus’ honour’d shade,
 short absence achilles paid.”
 
boastful words provoked raging god;
 fury swells violated flood.
 means divine may yet power employ
 check achilles, rescue troy?
 meanwhile hero springs arms, dare
 great asteropeus mortal war;
 pelagon, whose lofty line
 flows source axius, stream divine!
 (fair peribaea’s love god crown’d,
 refluent waters circled round:)
 achilles rush’d; fearless stood,
 shook two spears, advancing flood;
 flood impell’d him, pelides’ head
 avenge waters choked heaps dead.
 near drew, achilles thus began:
 
“what art thou, boldest race man?
 who, whence? unhappy sire
 whose encounters resistless ire.”
 
“o peleus! avails trace
 (replied warrior) illustrious race?
 rich paeonia’s valleys command,
 arm’d protended spears, native band;
 now shines tenth bright morning since came
 aid ilion fields fame:
 axius, swells neighbouring rills,
 wide around floated region fills,
 begot sire, whose spear much glory won:
 now lift thy arm, try hero’s son!”
 
threatening said: hostile chiefs advance;
 asteropeus discharged lance,
 (for dexterous hands lance wield,)
 one struck, pierced not, vulcanian shield;
 one razed achilles’ hand; spouting blood
 spun forth; earth fasten’d weapon stood.
 like lightning next pelean javelin flies:
 erring fury hiss’d along skies;
 deep swelling bank driven spear,
 even middle earth; quiver’d there.
 side sword pelides drew,
 foe double fury flew.
 foe thrice tugg’d, shook rooted wood;
 repulsive might weapon stood:
 fourth, tries break spear vain;
 bent stands, tumbles plain;
 belly open’d ghastly wound,
 reeking entrails pour upon ground.
 beneath hero’s feet panting lies,
 eye darkens, spirit flies;
 proud victor thus triumphing said,
 radiant armour tearing dead:
 
“so ends thy glory! fate prove,
 strive presumptuous sons jove!
 sprung river, didst thou boast thy line?
 great saturnius source mine.
 durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?
 peleus, Æacus, jove, i.
 race superior far those,
 thunders stream flows.
 rivers can, scamander might shown;
 jove dreads, wars son.
 even achelous might contend vain,
 roaring billows main.
 eternal ocean, whose fountains flow
 seas, rivers, springs below,
 thundering voice jove abhors hear,
 deep abysses shakes fear.”
 
said: bank javelin tore,
 left breathless warrior gore.
 floating tides bloody carcase lave,
 beat it, wave succeeding wave;
 till, roll’d banks, lies food
 curling eels, fishes flood.
 scatter’d round stream (their mightiest slain)
 amazed pæonians scour along plain;
 vents fury flying crew,
 thrasius, astyplus, mnesus slew;
 mydon, thersilochus, Ænius, fell;
 numbers lance plunged hell,
 bottom gulfs profound
 scamander spoke; shores return’d sound.
 
“o first mortals! (for gods thine)
 valour matchless, force divine!
 jove given thee every trojan head,
 ’tis thy rage heap dead.
 see! choked streams course can keep,
 roll wonted tribute deep.
 turn then, impetuous! injured flood;
 content, thy slaughters amaze god.”
 
human form, confess’d eyes,
 river thus; thus chief replies:
 “o sacred stream! thy word shall obey;
 till troy destined vengeance pay,
 till within towers perjured train
 shall pant, tremble arms again;
 till proud hector, guardian wall,
 stain lance, see achilles fall.”
 
said; drove fury foe.
 godhead silver bow
 yellow flood began: “o jove!
 mandate sire above
 full express, phœbus employ
 sacred arrows defence troy,
 make conquer, till hyperion’s fall
 awful darkness hide face all?”
 
spoke vain—the chief without dismay
 ploughs boiling surge desperate way.
 rising rage shores,
 deep bellowing river roars,
 huge heaps slain disgorges coast,
 round banks ghastly dead toss’d.
 before, billows ranged high,
 (a watery bulwark,) screen bands fly.
 now bursting head thundering sound,
 falling deluge whelms hero round:
 loaded shield bends rushing tide;
 feet, upborne, scarce strong flood divide,
 sliddering, staggering. border stood
 spreading elm, overhung flood;
 seized bending bough, steps stay;
 plant uprooted weight gave way.[270]
 heaving bank, undermining all;
 loud flash waters rushing fall
 thick foliage. large trunk display’d
 bridged rough flood across: hero stay’d
 weight, raised upon hand,
 leap’d channel, regain’d land.
 blacken’d wild waves: murmur rose:
 god pursues, huger billow throws,
 bursts bank, ambitious destroy
 man whose fury fate troy.
 like warlike eagle speeds pace
 (swiftest strongest aerial race);
 far spear can fly, achilles springs;
 every bound clanging armour rings:
 now here, now there, turns every side,
 winds course following tide;
 waves flow after, wheresoe’er wheels,
 gather fast, murmur heels.
 peasant garden brings
 soft rills water bubbling springs,
 calls floods high, bless bowers,
 feed pregnant streams plants flowers:
 soon clears whate’er passage stay’d,
 marks future current spade,
 swift o’er rolling pebbles, hills,
 louder louder purl falling rills;
 scattering, prevent pains,
 shine mazy wanderings o’er plains.
 
still flies achilles, eyes
 still swift scamander rolls where’er flies:
 speed escapes rapid floods;
 first men, match gods.
 oft turn’d torrent oppose,
 bravely try powers foes;
 oft surge, watery mountains spread,
 beats back, bursts upon head.
 yet dauntless still adverse flood braves,
 still indignant bounds waves.
 tired tides, knees relax toil;
 wash’d beneath slides slimy soil;
 thus (his eyes heaven’s expansion thrown)
 forth bursts hero angry groan:
 
“is god achilles befriend,
 power avert miserable end?
 prevent, jove! ignominious date,[271]
 make future life sport fate.
 heaven’s oracles believed vain,
 thetis must complain;
 phœbus’ darts prophesied fall,
 glorious arms trojan wall.
 oh! died fields battle warm,
 stretch’d like hero, hero’s arm!
 might hector’s spear dauntless bosom rend,
 swift soul o’ertake slaughter’d friend.
 ah no! achilles meets shameful fate,
 oh unworthy brave great!
 like vile swain, rainy day,
 crossing ford, torrent sweeps away,
 unregarded carcase sea.”
 
neptune pallas haste relief,
 thus human form address’d chief:
 power ocean first: “forbear thy fear,
 peleus! lo, thy gods appear!
 behold! jove descending thy aid,
 propitious neptune, blue-eyed maid.
 stay, furious flood shall cease rave
 ’tis thy fate glut angry wave.
 thou, counsel heaven suggests, attend!
 breathe combat, thy sword suspend,
 till troy receive flying sons, till all
 routed squadrons pant behind wall:
 hector alone shall stand fatal chance,
 hector’s blood shall smoke upon thy lance.
 thine glory doom’d.” thus spake gods:
 swift ascended bright abodes.
 
stung new ardour, thus heaven impell’d,
 springs impetuous, invades field:
 o’er expanded plain waters spread;
 heaved bounding billows danced dead,
 floating ’midst scatter’d arms; casques gold
 turn’d-up bucklers glitter’d roll’d.
 high o’er surging tide, leaps bounds,
 wades, mounts; parted wave resounds.
 whole river stops hero’s course,
 pallas fills immortal force.
 equal rage, indignant xanthus roars,
 lifts billows, o’erwhelms shores.
 
thus simois! “haste, brother flood;
 check mortal controls god;
 bravest heroes else shall quit fight,
 ilion tumble towery height.
 call thy subject streams, bid roar,
 thy fountains swell thy watery store,
 broken rocks, load dead,
 charge black surge, pour head.
 mark resistless floods goes,
 boldly bids warring gods foes!
 force, form divine sight,
 shall aught avail him, rage unite:
 whelm’d dark gulfs arms shall lie,
 blaze dreadful trojan eye;
 deep beneath sandy mountain hurl’d,
 immersed remain terror world.
 ponderous ruin shall confound place,
 greeks shall e’er perish’d relics grace,
 hand bones shall gather, inhume;
 cold rites, watery tomb.”
 

[illustration: ] achilles contending rivers
 

said; chief descends amain,
 increased gore, swelling slain.
 then, murmuring beds, boils, raves,
 foam whitens purple waves:
 every step, achilles stood
 crimson surge, deluged blood.
 fear touch’d queen heaven: saw dismay’d,
 call’d aloud, summon’d vulcan’s aid.
 
“rise war! insulting flood requires
 thy wasteful arm! assemble thy fires!
 aid, command enjoin’d,
 rush swift eastern western wind:
 old ocean word shall blow,
 pour red torrent watery foe,
 corses arms one bright ruin turn,
 hissing rivers bottoms burn.
 go, mighty thy rage! display thy power,
 drink whole flood, crackling trees devour.
 scorch banks! (till voice reclaim)
 exert unwearied furies flame!”
 
power ignipotent word obeys:
 wide o’er plain pours boundless blaze;
 consumes dead, dries soil
 shrunk waters channel boil.
 autumnal boreas sweeps sky,
 instant blows water’d gardens dry:
 look’d field, whiten’d ground,
 vulcan breathed fiery blast around.
 swift sedgy reeds ruin preys;
 along margin winds running blaze:
 trees flaming rows ashes turn,
 flowering lotos tamarisk burn,
 broad elm, cypress rising spire;
 watery willows hiss fire.
 now glow waves, fishes pant breath,
 eels lie twisting pangs death:
 now flounce aloft, now dive scaly fry,
 or, gasping, turn bellies sky.
 length river rear’d languid head,
 thus, short-panting, god said:
 
“oh vulcan! oh! power resists thy might?
 faint, sink, unequal fight—
 yield—let ilion fall; fate decree—
 ah—bend thy fiery arms me!”
 
ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;
 bubbling waters yield hissing sound.
 flames beneath cauldron rise,[272]
 melt fat rich sacrifice,
 amid fierce embrace circling fires
 waters foam, heavy smoke aspires:
 boils imprison’d flood, forbid flow,
 choked vapours feels bottom glow.
 juno then, imperial queen air,
 burning river sends earnest prayer:
 
“ah why, saturnia; must thy engage
 me, me, wasteful rage?
 gods dreadful arm employ,
 mightier gods assert cause troy.
 submissive desist, thou command;
 ah! withdraw all-destroying hand.
 hear solemn oath, yield fate
 unaided ilion, destined state,
 till greece shall gird destructive flame,
 one ruin sink trojan name.”
 
warm entreaty touch’d saturnia’s ear:
 bade ignipotent rage forbear,
 recall flame, mortal cause
 infest god: obedient flame withdraws:
 branching streams begin spread,
 soft remurmur wonted bed.
 
juno’s will strife resign,
 warring gods fierce contention join:
 rekindling rage heavenly breast alarms:
 horrid clangour shock ethereal arms:
 heaven loud thunder bids trumpet sound;
 wide beneath groans rending ground.
 jove, sport, dreadful scene descries,
 views contending gods careless eyes.
 power battles lifts brazen spear,
 first assaults radiant queen war:
 
“what moved thy madness, thus disunite
 ethereal minds, mix heaven fight?
 wonder this, thy frantic mood
 thou drovest mortal insult god?
 thy impious hand tydides’ javelin bore,
 madly bathed celestial gore.”
 
spoke, smote long-resounding shield,
 bears jove’s thunder dreadful field:
 adamantine ægis sire,
 turns glancing bolt forked fire.
 
heaved goddess mighty hand
 stone, limit neighbouring land,
 fix’d eldest times; black, craggy, vast;
 heavenly homicide cast.
 thundering falls, mass monstrous size:
 seven broad acres covers lies.
 stunning stroke stubborn nerves unbound:
 loud o’er fields ringing arms resound:
 scornful dame conquest views smiles,
 and, glorying, thus prostrate god reviles:
 
“hast thou yet, insatiate fury! known
 far minerva’s force transcends thy own?
 juno, thou rebellious darest withstand,
 corrects thy folly thus pallas’ hand;
 thus meets thy broken faith just disgrace,
 partial aid troy’s perfidious race.”
 
goddess spoke, turn’d eyes away,
 that, beaming round, diffused celestial day.
 jove’s cyprian daughter, stooping land,
 lent wounded god tender hand:
 slowly rises, scarcely breathes pain,
 and, propp’d fair arm, forsakes plain.
 bright empress heavens survey’d,
 and, scoffing, thus war’s victorious maid:
 
“lo! aid mars’s side seen!
 smiles’ loves’ unconquerable queen!
 mark insolence, open view,
 moves: let pallas, dares, pursue.”
 
minerva smiling heard, pair o’ertook,
 slightly breast wanton strook:
 she, unresisting, fell (her spirits fled);
 earth together lay lovers spread.
 “and like heroes fate all
 (minerva cries) guard trojan wall!
 grecian gods let phrygian be,
 dread, fierce, venus me;
 lowest stone shall troy moved.”
 thus she, juno smile approved.
 
meantime, mix mortal fight,
 god ocean dares god light.
 “what sloth seized us, fields around
 ring conflicting powers, heaven returns sound:
 shall, ignominious, shame retire,
 deed perform’d, olympian sire?
 come, prove thy arm! first war wage,
 suits greatness, superior age:
 rash thou art prop trojan throne,
 (forgetful wrongs, thy own,)
 guard race proud laomedon!
 hast thou forgot, how, monarch’s prayer,
 shared lengthen’d labours year?
 troy walls raised (for jove’s commands),
 yon proud bulwarks grew beneath hands:
 thy task feed bellowing droves
 along fair ida’s vales pendant groves.
 circling seasons train
 brought back grateful day crown’d pain,
 menace stern fraudful king defied
 latent godhead, prize denied:
 mad was, threaten’d servile bands,
 doom’d us exiles far barbarous lands.[273]
 incensed, heavenward fled swiftest wing,
 destined vengeance perjured king.
 dost thou, this, afford proud ilion grace,
 not, like us, infest faithless race;
 like us, present, future sons destroy,
 deep foundations heave troy?”
 
apollo thus: “to combat mankind
 ill suits wisdom celestial mind;
 man? calamitous birth,
 owe life nourishment earth;
 like yearly leaves, now, beauty crown’d,
 smile sun; now, wither ground.
 hands commit frantic scene,
 mix immortals cause mean.”
 
turns face, far-beaming heavenly fires,
 senior power submiss retires:
 thus retreating, artemis upbraids,
 quiver’d huntress sylvan shades:
 
“and thus youthful phœbus flies,
 yields ocean’s hoary sire prize?
 vain martial pomp, dreadful show
 pointed arrows silver bow!
 now boast yon celestial bower,
 thy force can match great earth-shaking power.”
 
silent heard queen woods upbraid:
 saturnia bore vaunting maid:
 furious thus: “what insolence driven
 thy pride face majesty heaven?
 though jove female plague design’d,
 fierce feeble race womankind,
 wretched matron feels thy piercing dart;
 thy sex’s tyrant, tiger’s heart?
 though tremendous woodland chase
 thy certain arrows pierce savage race?
 dares thy rashness powers divine
 employ arms, match thy force mine?
 learn hence, unequal war wage—”
 said, seized wrists eager rage;
 left hand lock’d, right untied
 bow, quiver, plumy pride.
 temples flies busy bow;
 now here, now there, winds blow;
 scattering arrows, rattling case,
 drop round, idly mark dusty place.
 swift field baffled huntress flies,
 scarce restrains torrent eyes:
 so, falcon wings way above,
 cleft cavern speeds gentle dove;
 (not fated yet die;) safe retreats,
 yet still heart marble beats.
 
latona hastes tender care;
 hermes viewing, thus declines war:
 “how shall face dame, gives delight
 whose thunders blacken heaven night?
 go, matchless goddess! triumph skies,
 boast conquest, yield prize.”
 
spoke; pass’d: latona, stooping low,
 collects scatter’d shafts fallen bow,
 that, glittering dust, lay there
 dishonour’d relics diana’s war:
 swift pursued blest abode,
 where, confused, sought sovereign god;
 weeping, grasp’d knees: ambrosial vest
 shook sighs, panted breast.
 
sire superior smiled, bade show
 heavenly hand caused daughter’s woe?
 abash’d, names imperial spouse;
 pale crescent fades upon brows.
 
thus above: while, swiftly gliding down,
 apollo enters ilion’s sacred town;
 guardian-god now trembled wall,
 fear’d greeks, though fate forbade fall.
 back olympus, war’s alarms,
 return shining bands gods arms;
 proud triumph, rage fire;
 take thrones around ethereal sire.
 
blood, death, achilles still proceeds,
 o’er slaughter’d heroes, o’er rolling steeds.
 avenging flames fury driven
 guilty towns exert wrath heaven;
 pale inhabitants, fall, fly;
 red vapours purple sky:
 raged achilles: death dire dismay,
 toils, terrors, fill’d dreadful day.
 
high turret hoary priam stands,
 marks waste destructive hands;
 views, arm, trojans’ scatter’d flight,
 near hero rising sight!
 stop, check, aid! feeble pace,
 settled sorrow aged face,
 fast could, sighing quits walls;
 thus descending, guards calls:
 
“you whose care city-gates belong,
 set wide portals flying throng:
 lo! comes, unresisted sway;
 comes, desolation marks way!
 within walls troops take breath,
 lock fast brazen bars, shut death.”
 thus charged reverend monarch: wide flung
 opening folds; sounding hinges rung.
 phœbus rush’d forth, flying bands meet;
 struck slaughter back, cover’d retreat,
 heaps trojans crowd gain gate,
 gladsome see last escape fate.
 thither, parch’d thirst, heartless train,
 hoary dust, beat hollow plain:
 gasping, panting, fainting, labour on
 heavier strides, lengthen toward town.
 enraged achilles follows spear;
 wild revenge, insatiable war.
 
greeks eternal praise acquired,
 troy inglorious walls retired;
 he, god darts ethereal flame,
 shot save her, redeem fame:
 young agenor force divine gave;
 (antenor’s offspring, haughty, bold, brave;)
 aid him, beside beech sate,
 wrapt clouds, restrain’d hand fate.
 now generous youth achilles spies,
 thick beats heart, troubled motions rise.
 (so, ere storm, waters heave roll.)
 stops, questions thus mighty soul;
 
“what, shall fly terror plain!
 like others fly, like others slain?
 vain hope! shun self-same road
 yon line slaughter’d trojans lately trod.
 no: common heap scorn fall—
 pass’d trojan wall,
 decline yonder path, leads
 ida’s forests surrounding shades?
 may reach, conceal’d, cooling flood,
 tired body wash dirt blood,
 soon night dusky veil extends,
 return safety trojan friends.
 if?—but wherefore vain debate?
 stand doubt, within reach fate?
 even now perhaps, ere yet turn wall,
 fierce achilles sees me, fall:
 swiftness, ’tis vain fly,
 valour, stands must die.
 howe’er ’tis better, fighting state,
 here, public view, meet fate.
 yet sure mortal; may feel
 (like sons earth) force steel.
 one soul informs dreadful frame:
 jove’s sole favour gives fame.”
 
said, stood, collected, might;
 beating bosom claim’d fight.
 deep-grown wood panther starts,
 roused thicket storm darts:
 untaught fear fly, hears sounds
 shouting hunters, clamorous hounds;
 though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives pain;
 barb’d javelin stings breast vain:
 whole war, untamed, savage flies;
 tears hunter, beneath dies.
 less resolved, antenor’s valiant heir
 confronts achilles, awaits war,
 disdainful retreat: high held before,
 shield (a broad circumference) bore;
 graceful stood, act throw
 lifted javelin, thus bespoke foe:
 
“how proud achilles glories fame!
 hopes day sink trojan name
 beneath ruins! know, hope vain;
 thousand woes, thousand toils remain.
 parents children just arms employ,
 strong many sons troy.
 great thou art, even thou may’st stain gore
 phrygian fields, press foreign shore.”
 
said: matchless force javelin flung
 smote knee; hollow cuishes rung
 beneath pointed steel; safe harms
 stands impassive ethereal arms.
 fiercely rushing daring foe,
 lifted arm prepares fatal blow:
 but, jealous fame, apollo shrouds
 god-like trojan veil clouds.
 safe pursuit, shut mortal view,
 dismiss’d fame, favoured youth withdrew.
 meanwhile god, cover escape,
 assumes agenor’s habit, voice shape,
 flies furious chief disguise;
 furious chief still follows flies.
 now o’er fields stretch lengthen’d strides,
 now urge course swift scamander glides:
 god, now distant scarce stride before,
 tempts pursuit, wheels shore;
 flying troops speed employ,
 pour heaps walls troy:
 stop, stay; thought ask, tell,
 ’scaped flight, battle fell.
 ’twas tumult all, violence flight;
 sudden joy confused, mix’d affright.
 pale troy achilles shuts gate:
 nations breathe, deliver’d fate.

death hector.
 

trojans safe within walls, hector stays oppose
 achilles. priam struck approach, tries persuade his
 re-enter town. hecuba joins entreaties, vain.
 hector consults within measures take; the
 advance achilles, resolution fails him, flies. achilles
 pursues thrice round walls troy. gods debate concerning
 fate hector; length minerva descends aid achilles.
 deludes hector shape deiphobus; stands combat, and
 slain. achilles drags dead body chariot sight of
 priam hecuba. lamentations, tears, despair. cries
 reach ears andromache, who, ignorant this, retired into
 inner part palace: mounts walls, beholds
 dead husband. swoons spectacle. excess grief and
 lamentation.
 thirtieth day still continues. scene lies walls,
 battlements troy.
 

thus bulwarks, smit panic fear,
 herded ilians rush like driven deer:
 safe wipe briny drops away,
 drown bowls labours day.
 close walls, advancing o’er fields
 beneath one roof well-compacted shields,
 march, bending on, greeks’ embodied powers,
 far stretching shade trojan towers.
 great hector singly stay’d: chain’d fate
 fix’d stood scæan gate;
 still bold arms determined employ,
 guardian still long-defended troy.
 
apollo now tired achilles turns:
 (the power confess’d glory burns:)
 “and (he cries) peleus’ view,
 mortal speed godhead pursue?
 thee know gods given,
 unskill’d trace latent marks heaven.
 boots thee now, troy forsook plain?
 vain thy past labour, thy present vain:
 safe walls now troops bestow’d,
 thy frantic rage attacks god.”
 
chief incensed—“too partial god day!
 check conquests middle way:
 ilion else refuge found!
 gasping numbers now bit ground!
 thou robb’st glory justly mine,
 powerful godhead, fraud divine:
 mean fame, alas! one heavenly strain,
 cheat mortal repines vain.”
 
city, terrible strong,
 high haughty steps tower’d along,
 proud courser, victor prize,
 near goal double ardour flies.

 flamed fiery mail. wept sage:
 strikes reverend head, now white age;
 lifts wither’d arms; obtests skies;
 calls much-loved feeble cries:
 son, resolved achilles’ force dare,
 full scæan gates expects war;
 sad father rampart stands,
 thus adjures extended hands:
 
“ah stay not, stay not! guardless alone;
 hector! loved, dearest, bravest son!
 methinks already behold thee slain,
 stretch’d beneath fury plain.
 implacable achilles! might’st thou be
 gods dearer me!

said, acting words say,
 rent head silver locks away.
 mournful mother bears part;
 yet sorrows turn hector’s heart.
 zone unbraced, bosom display’d;
 thus, fast-falling salt tears, said:
 
“have mercy me, son! revere
 words age; attend parent’s prayer!
 ever thee fond arms press’d,
 still’d thy infant clamours breast;
 ah thus helpless years forego,
 but, walls secured, repel foe.
 rage singly thou proceed,

 must thy corse lie honour’d bier,

they, cheeks torrents roll;
 fix’d remains purpose soul;
 resolved stands, fiery glance
 expects hero’s terrible advance.
 so, roll’d den, swelling snake
 beholds traveller approach brake;
 fed noxious herbs turgid veins
 gather’d half poisons plains;
 burns, stiffens collected ire,
 red eyeballs glare living fire.
 beneath turret, shield reclined,
 stood, question’d thus mighty mind:[275]
 
“where lies way? enter wall?
 honour shame ungenerous thought recall:
 shall proud polydamas gate
 proclaim, counsels obey’d late,
 timely follow’d former night,
 numbers saved hector’s flight?
 wise advice rejected disdain,
 feel folly people slain.
 methinks suffering country’s voice hear,
 worthless sons insult ear,
 rash courage charge chance war,

 no—if e’er return, return must
 glorious, country’s terror laid dust:

 field least, fighting wall.
 yet suppose measures forego,
 approach unarm’d, parley foe,
 warrior-shield, helm, lance, lay down,
 treat terms peace save town:
 wife withheld, treasure ill-detain’d
 (cause war, grievance land)
 honourable justice restore:
 add half ilion’s yet remaining store,
 troy shall, sworn, produce; injured greece
 may share wealth, leave walls peace.
 thought? unarm’d go,
 hope mercy vengeful foe,
 woman-like fall, fall without blow?
 greet here, man conversing man,
 met oak, journeying o’er plain;
 season now calm familiar talk,
 like youths maidens evening walk:
 war business, given
 die, triumph, that, determine heaven!”
 
thus pondering, like god greek drew nigh;
 dreadful plumage nodded high;
 pelian javelin, better hand,
 shot trembling rays glitter’d o’er land;
 breast beamy splendour shone,
 like jove’s lightning, rising sun.
 hector sees, unusual terrors rise,
 struck god, fears, recedes, flies.
 leaves gates, leaves wall behind:
 achilles follows like winged wind.
 thus panting dove falcon flies
 (the swiftest racer liquid skies),
 just holds, thinks holds prey,
 obliquely wheeling aerial way,
 open beak shrilling cries springs,
 aims claws, shoots upon wings:
 less fore-right rapid chase held,
 one urged fury, one fear impell’d:
 now circling round walls course maintain,
 high watch-tower overlooks plain;
 now fig-trees spread umbrage broad,
 (a wider compass,) smoke along road.

 arrows, darting javelin: various descriptions of
 which, various success several antagonists, make the
 greatest part book.

“not yet, brave companions war,

“all hail, patroclus! let thy honour’d ghost

 lo! dogs carcase resign;

“no drop shall touch me, almighty jove!

 till pyre place thee; till rear

 lo! shade, closing eyes,
 sad patroclus rose, seem’d rise:
 robe living wore, came:
 stature, voice, pleasing look, same.

 “and sleeps achilles? (thus phantom said:)
 sleeps achilles, patroclus dead?

 till spirit finds resting-place,
 unbodied spectres chase

 now give thy hand; farther shore
 pass, soul returns more:
 last funereal flames ascend,
 shall meet achilles friend;

 night friend, late battle lost,
 stood side, pensive, plaintive ghost:
 even now familiar, life, came;
 alas! different! yet like same!”
 
thus spoke, eye grew big tears:
 now rosy-finger’d morn appears,
 shows every mournful face tears o’erspread,

 eased shoulders, disposed load;
 circling around place, times come

 hero bids martial troops appear
 high cars pomp war;
 refulgent arms limbs attires,
 mount chariots, combatants squires.
 chariots first proceed, shining train;
 clouds foot smoke along plain;
 next melancholy band appear;
 amidst, lay dead patroclus bier;
 o’er corse scattered locks throw;
 achilles next, oppress’d mighty woe,
 supporting hands hero’s head,
 bends o’er extended body dead.
 patroclus decent appointed ground
 place, heap sylvan pile around.
 great achilles stands apart prayer,
 head divides yellow hair;
 curling locks youth vow’d,[287]

 sighing, deep locks cast,
 roll’d eyes around watery waste:
 
“sperchius! whose waves mazy errors lost
 delightful roll along native coast!
 vainly vow’d, return,

 full fifty rams bleed sacrifice,
 day thy silver fountains rise,
 shade consecrated bowers
 thy altars stand, perfumed native flowers!
 vow’d father, vow’d vain;
 achilles sees native plain;
 vain hope hairs longer grow,
 patroclus bears shades below.”
 
thus o’er patroclus hero pray’d,
 cold hand sacred lock laid.
 afresh grecian sorrows flow:
 now sun set upon woe;
 king men thus spoke chief:
 “enough, atrides! give troops relief:

 calls spirit dreadful cry:[290]
 
“all hail, patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost
 hear, exult, pluto’s dreary coast.
 behold achilles’ promise fully paid,
 twelve trojan heroes offer’d thy shade;
 heavier fates hector’s corse attend,
 saved flames, hungry dogs rend.”
 
spake he, threatening: gods made vain
 threat, guard inviolate slain:
 celestial venus hover’d o’er head,
 roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:
 watch’d night day,
 drove bloodhounds destined prey.
 sacred phœbus less employ’d care;
 pour’d around veil gather’d air,

[illustration: ] funeral pile patroclus
 

yet pile, dead patroclus lies,
 smokes, yet sullen flames arise;
 but, fast beside, achilles stood prayer,
 invoked gods whose spirit moves air,
 victims promised, libations cast,
 gentle zephyr boreal blast:
 call’d aerial powers, along skies
 breathe, whisper fires rise.
 winged iris heard hero’s call,
 instant hasten’d airy hall,
 old zephyr’s open courts high,

 poor father, helpless undone,

 ’twas when, emerging shades night,
 morning planet told approach light;
 and, fast behind, aurora’s warmer ray
 o’er broad ocean pour’d golden day:
 sank blaze, pile longer burn’d,
 caves whistling winds return’d:
 across thracian seas course bore;
 ruffled seas beneath passage roar.
 
parting pile ceased weep,
 sank quiet embrace sleep,
 exhausted grief: meanwhile crowd
 thronging grecians round achilles stood;
 tumult waked him: eyes shook
 unwilling slumber, chiefs bespoke:
 
“ye kings princes achaian name!

 third, charger yet untouch’d flame;
 four ample measures held shining frame:
 two golden talents fourth placed:
 ample double bowl contents last.
 fair order ranged upon plain,

“behold prizes, valiant greeks! decreed

fired word rival racers rise;
 far first eumelus hopes prize,
 famed though pieria fleetest breed,

 equal ardour bold tydides swell’d,

 base wealth preferring eternal praise.
 next antilochus demands course
 beating heart, cheers pylian horse.
 experienced nestor gives reins,

 prudent unattending ears.
 
“my son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,

 neptune jove thee conferr’d skill
 swift round goal turn flying wheel.

 slow, past vigour, steeds.
 fear thy rivals, though swiftness known;

 strength, art, obtains prize,

 ’tis art force numerous strokes
 dexterous woodman shapes stubborn oaks;
 art pilot, boiling deep
 howling tempest, steers fearless ship;
 ’tis artist wins glorious course;
 trust chariots horse.
 vain, unskilful goal strive,

 fix’d goal eye foreruns course,
 hand unerring steers steady horse,

 bear close this, warily proceed,

 shalt thou pass goal, secure mind,
 leave unskilful swiftness far behind:
 though thy fierce rival drove matchless steed

thus (nought unsaid) much-advising sage
 concludes; sat, stiff unwieldy age.

 stand order, impatient train:
 pelides points barrier plain,

 coursers barrier bound;
 lifted scourges resound;

 champaign thunder shore:
 thick, drive, dusty clouds arise,
 lost courser whirlwind flies;
 loose shoulders long manes reclined,
 float speed, dance upon wind:
 smoking chariots, rapid bound,
 now seem touch sky, now ground.
 hot fame, conquest care,

 batter’d face elbows strike ground;
 nose, mouth, front, one undistinguish’d wound:
 grief stops voice, torrent drowns eyes:
 far glad tydides flies;
 minerva’s spirit drives matchless pace,
 crowns victor labour’d race.
 
next, though distant, menelaus succeeds;
 thus young nestor animates steeds:
 “now, now, generous pair, exert force;
 hope match tydides’ horse,
 since great minerva wings rapid way,
 gives lord honours day;
 reach atrides! shall mare outgo
 swiftness? vanquish’d female foe?

 old man’s fury rises, ye die.
 haste then: yon narrow road, sight,
 presents occasion, use right.”
 
thus he. coursers master’s threat
 quicker steps sounding champaign beat.
 now antilochus nice survey
 observes compass hollow way.
 ’twas where, force wintry torrents torn,
 fast road precipice worn:
 here, one pass, shun throng
 spartan hero’s chariot smoked along.
 close venturous youth resolves keep,
 still edging near, bears toward steep.
 atrides, trembling, casts eye below,
 wonders rashness foe.
 “hold, stay steeds—what madness thus ride
 narrow way! take larger field (he cried),
 must fall.”—atrides cried vain;
 flies fast, throws rein.
 far able arm disk can send,
 youthful rivals full force extend,
 far, antilochus! thy chariot flew
 king: he, cautious, backward drew
 horse compell’d; foreboding fears
 rattling ruin clashing cars,
 floundering coursers rolling plain,

 thus upbraids rival flies:
 “go, furious youth! ungenerous unwise!
 go, expect i’ll prize resign;

 steeds force cries,
 “be swift, vigorous, regain prize!
 rivals, destitute youthful force,

 seem already retrieve day.
 
meantime grecians ring beheld
 coursers bounding o’er dusty field.
 first mark’d cretan king;
 high rising ground, ring,
 monarch sat: whence sure survey

 whose broad front blaze shining white,
 like full moon, stood obvious sight.
 saw; rising, greeks begun:
 “are yonder horse discern’d alone?
 can ye, all, another chief survey,
 steeds lately led way?
 those, though swiftest, god withheld,
 lie sure disabled middle field:
 for, since goal doubled, round plain
 search find them, search vain.
 perchance reins forsook driver’s hand,
 and, turn’d short, tumbled strand,
 shot chariot; coursers stray
 frantic fury destined way.
 rise other, inform sight,
 dim eyes, perhaps, discern right;
 yet sure seems, judge shape air,
 great Ætolian chief, renown’d war.”
 
“old man! (oïleus rashly thus replies)
 thy tongue hastily confers prize;
 view course, sharpest eyed,
 youngest, yet readiest decide.
 eumelus’ steeds, high bounding chase,
 still, first, unrivall’d lead race:
 well discern him, shakes rein,
 hear shouts victorious o’er plain.”
 
thus he. idomeneus, incensed, rejoin’d:
 “barbarous words! arrogant mind!
 contentious prince, greeks beside
 last merit, first pride!
 vile reproach answer can make?
 goblet tripod let us stake,
 king judge. unwise
 will learn rashness, pay price.”
 
said: ajax, mad passion borne,
 stern replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn
 fell extremes. thetis’ godlike son
 awful amidst rose, thus begun:
 
“forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful contend;
 much ye blame, others thus offend:
 lo! approaching steeds contest end.”
 sooner spoke, thundering near,
 drives, stream dust, charioteer.
 high o’er head circling lash wields:
 bounding horses scarcely touch fields:
 car amidst dusty whirlwind roll’d,
 bright mingled blaze tin gold,
 refulgent cloud: eye find
 track flying wheels left behind:
 fierce coursers urged rapid pace
 swift, seem’d flight, race.
 now victor goal tydides stands,
 quits bright car, springs upon sands;
 hot steeds sweaty torrents stream;
 well-plied whip hung athwart beam:
 joy brave sthenelus receives prize,
 tripod-vase, dame radiant eyes:
 ships train triumphant leads,
 chief unyokes panting steeds.
 
young nestor follows (who art, force,
 o’erpass’d atrides) second course.
 behind, atrides urged race, near
 courser swift career
 following car, just touching heel
 brushing tail whirling wheel:
 such, narrow now space between
 rivals, late distant green;
 soon swift Æthe lost ground regain’d,
 one length, one moment, race obtain’d.
 
merion pursued, greater distance still,
 tardier coursers, inferior skill.
 last came, admetus! thy unhappy son;
 slow dragged steeds batter’d chariot on:
 achilles saw, pitying thus begun:
 
“behold! man whose matchless art surpass’d
 sons greece! ablest, yet last!
 fortune denies, justice bids us pay
 (since great tydides bears first away)

greeks consent loud-applauding cries,
 eumelus received prize,
 youthful nestor, jealous fame,
 award opposes, asserts claim.
 “think (he cries) tamely will resign,
 peleus’ son! mare justly mine.
 gods, skilful confound,

 perhaps sought heaven sacrifice,
 vows omitted forfeited prize.
 yet (distinction thy friend show,
 please soul desirous bestow)
 gift must grace eumelus, view thy store
 beauteous handmaids, steeds, shining ore;
 ample present let thence receive,
 greece shall praise thy generous thirst give.
 prize never shall forego;
 this, touches, warriors! foe.”
 
thus spake youth; words offend;
 pleased well-turn’d flattery friend,
 achilles smiled: “the gift proposed (he cried),
 antilochus! shall ourself provide.
 plates brass corslet cover’d o’er,
 (the renown’d asteropaeus wore,)
 whose glittering margins raised silver shine,
 (no vulgar gift,) eumelus! shall thine.”
 
said: automedon command
 corslet brought, gave hand.
 distinguish’d friend, bosom glows
 generous joy: menelaus rose;
 herald placed sceptre hands,
 still’d clamour shouting bands.
 without cause incensed nestor’s son,
 inly grieving, thus king begun:
 
“the praise wisdom, thy youth obtain’d,
 act rash, antilochus! stain’d.
 robb’d glory just reward,
 you, grecians! wrong declared:
 leader shall conduct blame,
 judge envious rival’s fame.
 shall we, ourselves, truth maintain?
 needs appealing fact plain?
 greek shall blame me, bid thee rise,
 vindicate oath th’ ill-gotten prize?
 rise thou darest, thy chariot stand,
 driving scourge high-lifted thy hand;
 touch thy steeds, swear thy whole intent
 conquer, circumvent.
 swear god whose liquid arms surround
 globe, whose dread earthquakes heave ground!”
 
prudent chief calm attention heard;
 mildly thus: “excuse, youth err’d;
 superior thou art, forgive offence,
 thy equal, years, sense.
 thou know’st errors unripen’d age,
 weak counsels, headlong rage.
 prize quit, thou thy wrath resign;
 mare, aught thou ask’st, freely thine
 ere become (from thy dear friendship torn)
 hateful thee, gods forsworn.”
 
spoke antilochus; word
 mare contested king restored.
 joy swells soul: vernal grain
 lifts green ear springing plain,
 fields vegetable life renew,
 laugh glitter morning dew;
 joy spartan’s shining face o’erspread,
 lifted gay heart, thus said:
 
“still may souls, generous youth! agree
 ’tis now atrides’ turn yield thee.
 rash heat perhaps moment might control,
 break, settled temper thy soul.
 (my friend) ’tis still wiser way
 waive contention superior sway;
 ah! few, like thee offend,
 like thee, talents regain friend!
 plead indulgence, thy fault atone,
 suffice thy father’s merit thy own:
 generous alike, me, sire son
 greatly suffer’d, greatly done.
 yield; may know, soul can bend,
 pride preferr’d friend.”
 
said; pleased passion command,
 resign’d courser noemon’s hand,
 friend youthful chief: content,
 shining charger vessel sent.
 golden talents merion next obtain’d;
 fifth reward, double bowl, remain’d.
 achilles reverend nestor bears.
 thus purpose gift declares:
 “accept thou this, sacred sire! (he said)
 dear memorial patroclus dead;
 dead ever lost patroclus lies,
 ever snatch’d desiring eyes!
 take thou token grateful heart,
 though ’tis thine hurl distant dart,
 quoit toss, ponderous mace wield,
 urge race, wrestle field:
 thy pristine vigour age overthrown,
 left glory past thy own.”
 
said, placed goblet side;
 joy venerable king replied:
 
“wisely well, son, thy words proved
 senior honour’d, friend beloved!
 true is, deserted strength,
 wither’d arms limbs fail’d length.
 oh! now force felt yore,

 go thou, son! generous friendship led,
 martial honours decorate dead:
 pleased take gift thy hands present,
 (pledge benevolence, kind intent,)
 rejoiced, numerous greeks, see
 one honours sacred age me:
 due distinctions thou well canst pay,
 may just gods return another day!”
 
proud gift, thus spake full days:
 achilles heard him, prouder praise.
 
prizes next order’d field,
 bold champions caestus wield.
 stately mule, yet toils unbroke,
 six years’ age, unconscious yoke,
 circus led, firmly bound;
 next stands goblet, massy, large, round.
 achilles rising, thus: “let greece excite
 two heroes equal hardy fight;
 dare foe lifted arms provoke,
 rush beneath long-descending stroke.
 apollo shall palm bestow,
 greeks supreme conquest know,
 mule dauntless labours shall repay,
 vanquish’d bear massy bowl away.”
 
dreadful combat great epeüs chose;[291]
 high o’er crowd, enormous bulk! rose,
 seized beast, thus began say:
 “stand forth man, bear bowl away!
 (price ruin: dares deny
 mule right; undoubted victor i)
 others, ’tis own’d, fields battle shine,
 first honours fight mine;
 excels all? let foe
 draw near, first certain fortune know;
 secure hand shall whole frame confound,
 mash bones, body pound:
 let friends nigh, needful train,
 heave batter’d carcase plain.”
 
giant spoke; stupid gaze
 host beheld him, silent amaze!
 ’twas thou, euryalus! durst aspire
 meet might, emulate thy sire,
 great mecistheus; days yore
 theban games noblest trophy bore,
 (the games ordain’d dead oedipus grace,)
 singly vanquish cadmean race.
 great tydides urges contend,
 warm hopes conquest friend;
 officious cincture girds round;
 wrist gloves death bound.
 amid circle now champion stands,
 poises high air iron hands;
 clashing gauntlets now fiercely close,
 crackling jaws re-echo blows,
 painful sweat members flows.
 length epeus dealt weighty blow
 full cheek unwary foe;
 beneath ponderous arm’s resistless sway
 dropp’d he, nerveless, extended lay.
 large fish, winds waters roar,
 huge billow dash’d shore,
 lies panting; less batter’d wound,
 bleeding hero pants upon ground.
 rear fallen foe, victor lends,
 scornful, hand; gives friends;
 whose arms support him, reeling throng,
 dragging disabled legs along;
 nodding, head hangs shoulder o’er;
 mouth nostrils pour clotted gore;[292]
 wrapp’d round mists lies, lost thought;
 friends receive bowl, dearly bought.
 
third bold game achilles next demands,
 calls wrestlers level sands:
 massy tripod victor lies,
 twice six oxen reputed price;
 next, loser’s spirits restore,
 female captive, valued four.
 scarce chief vigorous strife propose
 tower-like ajax ulysses rose.
 amid ring nervous rival stands,
 embracing rigid implicit hands.
 close lock’d above, heads arms mix’d:
 below, planted feet distance fix’d;
 like two strong rafters builder forms,
 proof wintry winds howling storms,
 tops connected, wider space
 fix’d centre stands solid base.
 now grasp manly body bends;
 humid sweat every pore descends;
 bones resound blows: sides, shoulders, thighs
 swell gripe, bloody tumours rise.
 ulysses, art renown’d,
 o’erturn strength ajax ground;
 strength ajax overthrow
 watchful caution artful foe.
 long strife even tired lookers on,
 thus ulysses spoke great telamon:
 “or let lift thee, chief, lift thou me:
 prove force, jove rest decree.”
 
said; and, straining, heaved ground
 matchless strength; time ulysses found
 strength evade, nerves combine
 ankle struck: giant fell supine;
 ulysses, following, bosom lies;
 shouts applause run rattling skies.
 ajax lift ulysses next essays;
 barely stirr’d him, raise:
 knee lock’d fast, foe’s attempt denied;
 grappling close, tumbled side side.
 defiled honourable dust roll,
 still breathing strife, unsubdued soul:
 rage, combat rise;
 great achilles thus divides prize:
 
“your noble vigour, friends, restrain;
 weary generous strength vain.
 ye won: let others excel,
 now prove prowess proved well.”
 
hero’s words willing chiefs obey,
 tired bodies wipe dust away,
 and, clothed anew, following games survey.
 
now succeed gifts ordain’d grace
 youths contending rapid race:
 silver urn full six measures held,
 none weight workmanship excell’d:
 sidonian artists taught frame shine,
 elaborate, artifice divine;
 whence tyrian sailors prize transport,
 gave thoas lemnian port:
 descended, good eunaeus heir’d
 glorious gift; and, lycaon spared,
 brave patroclus gave rich reward:
 now, hero’s funeral rites grace,
 stands prize swiftness race.
 well-fed ox second placed;
 half talent must content last.
 achilles rising bespoke train:
 “who hope palm swiftness obtain,
 stand forth, bear prizes plain.”
 
hero said, starting place,
 oilean ajax rises race;
 ulysses next; whose speed surpass’d
 youthful equals, nestor’s son, last.
 ranged line ready racers stand;
 pelides points barrier hand;
 start once; oïleus led race;
 next ulysses, measuring pace pace;
 behind him, diligently close, sped,
 closely following running thread
 spindle follows, displays charms
 fair spinster’s breast moving arms:
 graceful motion thus, foe plies,
 treads footstep ere dust can rise;
 glowing breath upon shoulders plays:
 admiring greeks loud acclamations raise:
 give wishes, hearts, eyes,
 send souls flies.
 now three times turn’d prospect goal,
 panting chief pallas lifts soul:
 “assist, goddess!” thus thought pray’d!
 present thought descends maid.
 buoy’d heavenly force, seems swim,
 feels pinion lifting every limb.
 fierce, ready now prize gain,
 unhappy ajax stumbles plain
 (o’erturn’d pallas), slippery shore
 clogg’d slimy dung mingled gore.
 (the self-same place beside patroclus’ pyre,
 late slaughter’d victims fed fire.)
 besmear’d filth, blotted o’er clay,
 obscene sight, rueful racer lay;
 well-fed bull (the second prize) shared,
 left urn ulysses’ rich reward.
 then, grasping horn mighty beast,
 baffled hero thus greeks address’d:
 
“accursed fate! conquest forego;
 mortal i, goddess foe;
 urged favourite rapid way,
 pallas, ulysses, won day.”
 
thus sourly wail’d he, sputtering dirt gore;
 burst laughter echoed shore.
 antilochus, humorous rest,
 takes last prize, takes jest:
 
“why wiser elders strive?
 gods still love them, always thrive.
 ye see, ajax must yield prize:
 ulysses, still aged wise;
 (a green old age unconscious decays,
 proves hero born better days!)
 behold vigour active race!
 achilles boasts swifter pace:
 can match achilles? can,
 must yet hero, man.”
 
effect succeeds speech. pelides cries,
 “thy artful praise deserves better prize.
 greece vain shall hear thy friend extoll’d;
 receive talent purest gold.”
 youth departs content. host admire
 nestor, worthy sire.
 
next buckler, spear, helm, brings;
 cast plain, brazen burden rings:
 arms late divine sarpedon wore,
 great patroclus short triumph bore.
 “stand forth bravest host! (he cries)
 whoever dares deserve rich prize,
 now grace lists army’s sight,
 sheathed steel, provoke foe fight.
 first jointed armour shall explore,
 stain rival’s mail issuing gore,
 sword asteropaeus possess’d old,
 (a thracian blade, distinct studs gold,)
 shall pay stroke, grace striker’s side:
 arms common let chiefs divide:
 brave champion, combat ends,
 sumptuous banquet tents attends.”
 
fierce word uprose great tydeus’ son,
 huge bulk ajax telamon.
 clad refulgent steel, either hand,
 dreadful chiefs amid circle stand;
 louring meet, tremendous sight;
 argive bosom beats fierce delight.
 opposed arms long idly stood,
 thrice closed, thrice charge renew’d.
 furious pass spear ajax made
 broad shield, corslet stay’d.
 thus foe: javelin aim’d above
 buckler’s margin, neck drove.
 greece, now trembling hero’s life,
 bade share honours, surcease strife.
 yet still victor’s due tydides gains,
 sword studded belt remains.
 
hurl’d hero, thundering ground,
 mass iron (an enormous round),
 whose weight size circling greeks admire,
 rude furnace, shaped fire.
 mighty quoit aëtion wont rear,
 whirling arm dismiss air;
 giant achilles slain, stow’d
 among spoils memorable load.
 this, bids nervous artists vie,
 teach disk sound along sky.
 “let him, whose might can hurl bowl, arise;
 farthest hurls it, take prize;
 one enrich’d large domain
 downs flocks, arable grain,
 small stock iron needs man provide;
 hinds swains whole years shall supplied
 hence; ask neighbouring city’s aid
 ploughshares, wheels, rural trade.”
 
stern polypœtes stepp’d throng,
 great leonteus, mortal strong;
 whose force rival forces oppose,
 uprose great ajax; epeus rose.
 stood order: first epeus threw;
 high o’er wondering crowds whirling circle flew.
 leonteus next little space surpass’d;
 third, strength godlike ajax cast.
 o’er marks flew; till fiercely flung
 polypœtes’ arm discus sung:
 far swain whirling sheephook throws,
 distant falls among grazing cows,
 past rapid circle flies:
 friends, loud applauses shake skies,
 force conjoin’d heave weighty prize.
 
those, skilful archery contend,
 next invites twanging bow bend;
 twice ten axes casts amidst round,
 ten double-edged, ten singly wound
 mast, late first-rate galley bore,
 hero fixes sandy shore;
 tall top milk-white dove tie,
 trembling mark arrows fly.
 
“whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird, shall bear
 two-edged axes, terrible war;
 single, whose shaft divides cord.”
 said: experienced merion took word;
 skilful teucer: helm threw
 lots inscribed, forth latter flew.
 swift string sounding arrow flies;
 flies unbless’d! grateful sacrifice,
 firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow
 phœbus, patron shaft bow.
 this, thy well-aim’d arrow turn’d aside,
 err’d dove, yet cut cord tied:
 adown mainmast fell parted string,
 free bird heaven displays wing:
 sea, shores, skies, loud applause resound,
 merion eager meditates wound:
 takes bow, directs shaft above,
 following eye soaring dove,
 implores god speed skies,
 vows firstling lambs, grateful sacrifice,
 dove, airy circles wheels,
 amid clouds piercing arrow feels;
 quite point passage found,
 feet fell bloody ground.
 wounded bird, ere yet breathed last,
 flagging wings alighted mast,
 moment hung, spread pinions there,
 sudden dropp’d, left life air.
 pleased crowd new peals thunder rise,
 ships brave merion bears prize.
 
close funeral games, achilles last
 massy spear amid circle placed,
 ample charger unsullied frame,
 flowers high-wrought, blacken’d yet flame.
 bids heroes prove art,
 whose dexterous skill directs flying dart.
 great merion hopes noble prize;
 disdain’d king men rise.
 joy pelides saw honour paid,
 rose monarch, respectful said:
 
“thee first virtue, power supreme,
 king nations! thy greeks proclaim;
 every martial game thy worth attest,
 know thee greatest best.
 take prize, let brave merion bear
 beamy javelin thy brother’s war.”
 
pleased hero’s lips praise hear,
 king merion gives brazen spear:
 but, set apart sacred use, commands
 glittering charger talthybius’ hands.

 king jove’s messenger appears,

afflicted monarch shiver’d despair;
 pale grew face, upright stood hair;
 sunk heart; colour went came;
 sudden trembling shook aged frame:
 hermes, greeting, touch’d royal hand,
 and, gentle, thus accosts kind demand:
 
“say whither, father! mortal sight
 seal’d sleep, thou wanderest night?
 roam thy mules steeds plains along,
 grecian foes, numerous strong?
 couldst thou hope, thy treasures view;
 these, endless hate thy race pursue?

“thy words, speak benevolence mind,

 fliest thou now?—what hopes can troy retain,
 thy matchless son, guard glory, slain?”
 
king, alarm’d: “say what, whence thou art
 search sorrows parent’s heart,
 know well godlike hector died?”
 thus priam spoke, hermes thus replied:
 
“you tempt me, father, pity touch:
 sad subject inquire much.
 oft eyes godlike hector view’d
 glorious fight, grecian blood embrued:
 saw when, like jove, flames toss’d
 thousand ships, wither’d half host:
 saw, help’d not: stern achilles’ ire
 forbade assistance, enjoy’d fire.

“if thou art stern pelides’ train,
 (the mournful monarch thus rejoin’d again,)
 ah tell truly, where, oh! laid
 son’s dear relics? befalls dead?
 dogs dismember’d (on naked plains),
 yet unmangled rest, cold remains?”
 
“o favour’d skies! (thus answered then
 power mediates god men)
 dogs vultures thy hector rent,

 untouch’d worms, untainted air.
 still aurora’s ruddy beam spread,
 round friend’s tomb achilles drags dead:

 majestical death! stains found
 o’er corse, closed every wound,
 though many wound gave. heavenly care,
 hand divine, preserves ever fair:

thus spoke priam celestial guide,
 joyful thus royal sire replied:
 “blest man pays gods above

 snatch’d reins, whirl’d lash around:
 inspiring god urged on,

 now reach’d naval walls, found
 guards repasting, bowls go round;

 heaved massy gates, removed bars,
 o’er trenches led rolling cars.
 unseen, hostile camp went,
 now approach’d pelides’ lofty tent.
 firs roof raised, cover’d o’er
 reeds collected marshy shore;
 and, fenced palisades, hall state,
 (the work soldiers,) hero sat:
 large door, whose well-compacted strength
 solid pine-tree barr’d wondrous length:
 scarce three strong greeks lift mighty weight,
 great achilles singly closed gate.
 hermes (such power gods) set wide;
 swift alighted celestial guide,
 thus reveal’d—”hear, prince! understand
 thou ow’st thy guidance mortal hand:
 hermes am, descended above,

 farewell: shun achilles’ sight fly;
 uncommon favours sky,
 stand confess’d frail mortality.
 now fearless enter, prefer thy prayers;
 adjure father’s silver hairs,

thus said, vanish’d eyes,
 moment shot skies:
 king, confirm’d heaven, alighted there,
 left aged herald car,
 solemn pace various rooms went,
 found achilles inner tent:
 sat hero: alcimus brave,
 great automedon, attendance gave:
 served person royal feast;
 around, awful distance, stood rest.
 
unseen these, king entry made:
 and, prostrate now achilles laid,

 embraced knees, bathed hands tears;
 direful hands kisses press’d, embrued
 even best, dearest blood!
 
wretch (who, conscious crime,
 pursued murder, flies native clime)
 just gains frontier, breathless, pale, amazed,
 gaze, wonder: thus achilles gazed:
 thus stood attendants stupid surprise:
 mute, yet seem’d question eyes:
 look’d other, none silence broke,
 till thus last kingly suppliant spoke:
 
“ah think, thou favour’d powers divine![295]
 think thy father’s age, pity mine!

“permit now, beloved jove! steep

 hapless son, dust bed;
 soft sleep stranger weeping eyes;

that, achilles bade prepare bed,
 purple soft shaggy carpets spread;
 forth, flaming lights, bend way,
 place couches, coverings lay.

“turn steps, eyes employ,

thronging crowds issue plains;

 hang wheels, grovel round slain.

[257] coleridge (greek classic poets, p. 182, seq.) diligently
 compared description shield hercules by
 hesiod. remarks that, “with two three exceptions, imagery
 differs little names arrangements; the
 difference arrangement shield hercules altogether for
 worse. natural consecution homeric images needs no
 exposition: constitutes one beauties work.
 hesiodic images huddled together without connection or
 congruity: mars pallas awkwardly introduced among centaurs
 lapithae;— gap wide indeed apollo with
 muses, waking echoes olympus celestial harmonies; whence
 however, hurried back perseus, gorgons, images
 war, arm sea, sporting dolphins, the
 fugitive fishes, fisherman shore casting net,
 minutely represented. hesiodic images themselves, the
 leading remark is, catch beauty ornament, at
 sublimity exaggeration; upon untenable supposition the
 genuineness poem, curious peculiarity, that, in
 description scenes rustic peace, superiority homer is
 decisive—while war tumult may thought, perhaps,
 hesiodic poet advantage.”
