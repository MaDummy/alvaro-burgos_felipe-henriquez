introduction
 
prefaratory
 
considerable reluctance abandoned favour the
 present undertaking long favourite project: a
 new edition shelton’s “don quixote,” now become somewhat
 scarce book. some—and confess one—for whom
 shelton’s racy old version, defects, charm no
 modern translation, however skilful correct, possess. shelton
 inestimable advantage belonging generation as
 cervantes; “don quixote” vitality contemporary
 feel; cost dramatic effort see things cervantes
 saw them; anachronism language; put spanish
 cervantes english shakespeare. shakespeare most
 likely knew book; may carried home his
 saddle-bags stratford one last journeys, the
 mulberry tree new place joined hands kindred genius its
 pages.
 
soon made plain hope even moderate
 popularity shelton vain. fine old crusted english would, no
 doubt, relished minority, minority.
 warmest admirers must admit satisfactory
 representative cervantes. translation first part very
 hastily made never revised him. freshness and
 vigour, also full measure faults, hasty production.
 often literal—barbarously literal frequently—but just as
 often loose. evidently good colloquial knowledge of
 spanish, apparently much more. never seems occur him
 translation word will suit every case.
 
often said satisfactory translation “don
 quixote.” familiar original, savours of
 truism platitude say so, truth can thoroughly
 satisfactory translation “don quixote” english other
 language. spanish idioms utterly
 unmanageable, untranslatable words, numerous enough no
 doubt, superabundant, rather sententious terseness
 humour book owes flavour peculiar to
 spanish, can best distantly imitated other
 tongue.
 
history english translations “don quixote” is
 instructive. shelton’s, first language, made,
 apparently, 1608, published till 1612. course was
 first part. asserted second, published in
 1620, work shelton, nothing support the
 assertion save fact less spirit, less we
 generally understand “go,” first, be
 natural first work young man writing
 _currente calamo_, second middle-aged man writing for
 bookseller. hand, closer literal, the
 style same, translations, mistranslations,
 occur it, extremely unlikely new translator would,
 suppressing name, allowed shelton carry credit.
 
1687 john phillips, milton’s nephew, produced “don quixote” “made
 english,” says, “according humour modern language.”
 “quixote” much translation travesty, a
 travesty coarseness, vulgarity, buffoonery almost
 unexampled even literature day.
 
ned ward’s “life notable adventures don quixote, merrily
 translated hudibrastic verse” (1700), can scarcely reckoned a
 translation, serves show light “don quixote” was
 regarded time.
 
illustration may found version published 1712 by
 peter motteux, recently combined tea-dealing with
 literature. described “translated original several
 hands,” spanish flavour entirely evaporated the
 manipulation several hands. flavour has, the
 hand, distinctly franco-cockney. anyone compares it
 carefully original will little doubt a
 concoction shelton french filleau saint martin, eked
 borrowings phillips, whose mode treatment adopts. it
 is, sure, decent decorous, treats “don quixote”
 fashion comic book made comic.
 
attempt improve humour “don quixote” infusion of
 cockney flippancy facetiousness, motteux’s operators did, not
 merely impertinence like larding sirloin prize beef, an
 absolute falsification spirit book, proof of
 uncritical way “don quixote” generally read this
 worse worthless translation—worthless failing represent,
 worse worthless misrepresenting—should favoured it
 been.
 
effect, however, bringing translation undertaken
 executed different spirit, charles jervas, the
 portrait painter, friend pope, swift, arbuthnot, gay. jervas
 allowed little credit work, indeed may said
 none, known world general jarvis’s. not
 published death, printers gave name
 according current pronunciation day. most
 freely used freely abused translations. has
 seen far editions other, admitted hands to
 far faithful, yet nobody seems good word
 say author. jervas doubt prejudiced readers
 preface, among many true words about
 shelton, stevens, motteux, rashly unjustly charges shelton
 translated spanish, italian
 version franciosini, appear ten years after
 shelton’s first volume. suspicion incompetence, too, seems have
 attached profession painter mediocre
 one (though given us best portrait swift), and
 may strengthened pope’s remark “translated
 ‘don quixote’ without understanding spanish.” also charged
 borrowing shelton, disparaged. true a
 difficult obscure passages followed shelton, gone
 astray him; one case sort, fifty where
 right shelton wrong. pope’s dictum, anyone who
 examines jervas’s version carefully, side side original,
 will see sound spanish scholar, incomparably better one
 shelton, except perhaps mere colloquial spanish. was, in
 fact, honest, faithful, painstaking translator, left
 version which, whatever shortcomings may be, singularly free
 errors mistranslations.
 
charge stiff, dry—“wooden” word,—and
 one can deny foundation it. may be
 pleaded jervas good deal rigidity due his
 abhorrence light, flippant, jocose style predecessors. he
 one few, few, translators shown any
 apprehension unsmiling gravity essence quixotic
 humour; seemed crime bring cervantes forward smirking
 grinning good things, may attributed a
 great measure ascetic abstinence everything savouring of
 liveliness characteristic translation. most
 modern editions, observed, style smoothed and
 smartened, without reference original spanish, that
 made read agreeably also robbed of
 chief merit fidelity.
 
smollett’s version, published 1755, may almost counted one of
 these. rate plain construction jervas’s
 translation freely drawn upon, little probably no
 heed given original spanish.
 
later translations may dismissed words. george kelly’s,
 appeared 1769, “printed translator,” impudent
 imposture, nothing motteux’s version the
 words, there, artfully transposed; charles wilmot’s (1774) was
 abridgment like florian’s, skilfully executed; and
 version published miss smirke 1818, accompany her
 brother’s plates, merely patchwork production made former
 translations. latest, mr. a. j. duffield’s, every
 sense word impertinent offer opinion here. not
 even seen present undertaking proposed me, since
 may say vidi tantum, obvious reasons resisted the
 temptation mr. duffield’s reputation comely volumes hold out
 every lover cervantes.
 
foregoing history translations “don quixote,” it
 will seen good many people who, provided get
 mere narrative full complement facts, incidents, and
 adventures served form amuses them, care very
 little whether form one cervantes originally
 shaped ideas. hand, clear many
 desire merely story tells, story he
 tells it, far least differences idiom circumstances
 permit, will give preference conscientious translator,
 even though may acquitted somewhat awkwardly.
 
real antagonism two classes;
 reason pleases one please the
 other, translator makes aim treat “don quixote”
 respect due great classic, acceptable
 even careless reader one treats famous old
 jest-book. question caviare general, or, it
 is, fault rests makes so. method which
 cervantes won ear spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to
 equally effective great majority english readers. any
 rate, even readers matter indifference,
 fidelity method much part translator’s duty as
 fidelity matter. can please parties, much the
 better; first duty look faithful
 representation author power give them,
 faithful letter long fidelity practicable, faithful to
 spirit far can make it.
 
purpose dogmatise rules translation, to
 indicate followed, least tried best my
 ability follow, present instance. one which, seems me,
 rigidly followed translating “don quixote,” to
 avoid everything savours affectation. book is,
 indeed, one sense protest it, man abhorred more
 cervantes. reason, think, temptation use
 antiquated obsolete language resisted. an
 affectation, one warrant excuse. spanish
 probably undergone less change since seventeenth century than
 language europe, far greater certainly best
 part “don quixote” differs little language the
 colloquial spanish present day. except tales don
 quixote’s speeches, translator uses simplest plainest
 everyday language will almost always one approaches nearest
 original.
 
seeing story “don quixote” characters and
 incidents now two centuries half familiar
 household words english mouths, seems old
 familiar names phrases changed without good reason.
 course translator holds “don quixote” receive the
 treatment great classic deserves, will feel bound the
 injunction laid upon morisco chap. ix omit add
 anything.
 



cervantes
 

four generations laughed “don quixote” occurred to
 anyone ask, manner man miguel cervantes
 saavedra whose name title-page; late a
 satisfactory answer question proposed add life
 author london edition published lord carteret’s
 instance 1738. traces personality cervantes by
 time disappeared. floating traditions may have
 existed, transmitted men known him, long since died
 out, record none; sixteenth and
 seventeenth centuries incurious “the men time,” a
 reproach nineteenth has, rate, secured itself,
 produced shakespeare cervantes. mayans y

this, however, done last-named biographer good

 methodising rare patience judgment previously

 anything illustrate subject might possibly found.
 navarrete done industry acumen do, no
 fault given us want. hallam says of
 shakespeare may applied almost parallel case cervantes:
 “it register baptism, draft will, or

 contemporary produced.”
 
natural, therefore, biographers cervantes,
 forced make brick without straw, recourse largely to

 conjecture, leave reader’s judgment decide whether the
 data justify inference not.

 demand third edition, seventh all, 1608. the
 popularity book italy milan bookseller was
 led bring edition 1610; another called in
 brussels 1611. might naturally expected that, such
 proofs hit taste public, cervantes
 set redeeming rather vague promise a
 second volume.
 
but, appearance, nothing farther thoughts. had
 still one two short tales vintage had
 inserted “don quixote” instead continuing adventures of
 don quixote, set work write “novelas exemplares”
 afterwards called them, view making book them.
 
novels published summer 1613, dedication to
 conde lemos, maecenas day, one those
 chatty confidential prefaces cervantes fond of. this, eight
 years half first part “don quixote” appeared, we
 get first hint forthcoming second part. “you shall see
 shortly,” says, “the exploits don quixote humours of
 sancho panza.” idea “shortly” somewhat elastic one, for,
 know date sancho’s letter, barely one-half of

poems, pastorals, novels, dramatic
 ambition engrossed thoughts. indomitable spirit that

 attempt escape comrades again, made

 man. nothing managers might say persuade the
 merits plays recognised last only
 given fair chance. old soldier spanish salamis bent on

 cupidity managers shortsightedness authors; he

 tragedies model greek drama—like “numancia” for
 instance—and comedies amuse improve and
 instruct. do, get hearing: was
 initial difficulty.
 
shows plainly enough, too, “don quixote” demolition of
 chivalry romances work lay next heart. was,
 indeed, says preface, stepfather a
 father “don quixote.” never great work neglected its
 author. written carelessly, hastily, fits and
 starts, always fault, seems clear never read what

 never took trouble correct third edition in

 mere libro entretenimiento, amusing book, thing, says in
 “viaje,” “to divert melancholy moody heart time or

 popularity success book, beyond measure
 delightful naivete shows pride dozen
 passages second part. success coveted. in
 probability given success “don quixote,”
 nay, seen every copy “don quixote” burned plaza
 mayor, one success lope vega enjoying average
 week.
 
went on, dawdling “don quixote,” adding chapter now
 again, putting aside turn “persiles and
 sigismunda”—which, know, entertaining book in
 language, rival “theagenes chariclea”—or finishing
 one darling comedies; robles asked “don quixote”
 ready, answer doubt was: breve—shortly, was
 time enough that. sixty-eight full life hope
 plans future boy eighteen.
 
nemesis coming, however. got far chapter lix, at
 leisurely pace hardly reached october or
 november 1614, put hand small octave lately
 printed tarragona, calling “second volume the
 ingenious gentleman don quixote mancha: licentiate alonso
 fernandez avellaneda tordesillas.” last half chapter lix
 following chapters second part give us idea
 effect produced upon him, irritation likely to
 lessened reflection one blame himself.
 avellaneda, fact, content merely bringing a
 continuation “don quixote,” cervantes reasonable
 grievance. intentions expressed vaguest
 language end book; nay, last words, “forse altro
 cantera miglior plettro,” seems actually invite someone else
 continue work, made sign eight years half
 gone by; time avellaneda’s volume doubt written.
 
fact cervantes case, bad one, far mere
 continuation concerned. avellaneda chose write preface to
 it, full coarse personal abuse ill-conditioned man
 pour out. taunts cervantes old, lost
 hand, prison, poor, being
 friendless, accuses envy lope’s success, petulance and
 querulousness, on; sting lay.
 avellaneda’s reason personal attack obvious enough. whoever
 may been, clear one dramatists of
 lope’s school, impudence charge cervantes with
 attacking well lope criticism drama. his
 identification exercised best critics baffled the
 ingenuity research brought bear it. navarrete
 ticknor incline belief cervantes knew was;
 must say think anger shows suggests invisible
 assailant; like irritation man stung mosquito in
 dark. cervantes certain solecisms language pronounces him
 aragonese, pellicer, aragonese himself, supports this
 view believes him, moreover, ecclesiastic, a
 dominican probably.
 
merit avellaneda reflected cervantes, too
 dull reflect much. “dull dirty” will always be, imagine, the
 verdict vast majority unprejudiced readers. is, best, a
 poor plagiarist; can follow slavishly lead given
 cervantes; humour lies making don quixote take inns
 castles fancy legendary historical personage,
 sancho mistake words, invert proverbs, display gluttony;
 shows proclivity coarseness dirt, has
 contrived introduce two tales filthier anything the
 sixteenth century novellieri without sprightliness.
 
whatever avellaneda book may be, must forget the
 debt owe them. them, can doubt, “don quixote”
 come us mere torso instead complete work. even if
 cervantes finished volume hand, assuredly he
 left promise third part, giving further
 adventures don quixote humours sancho panza shepherds. it
 plain one time intention dealing the
 pastoral romances dealt books chivalry, but
 avellaneda tried carry out. more
 likely that, plans, projects, hopefulness, volume
 remained unfinished till death, have
 never made acquaintance duke duchess, gone with
 sancho barataria.
 
moment book came hands seems been
 haunted fear might avellanedas field,
 putting everything else aside, set finish his
 task protect don quixote way could, killing him.
 conclusion doubt hasty places clumsy piece of
 work frequent repetition scolding administered to
 avellaneda becomes end rather wearisome; is, rate,
 conclusion must thank avellaneda.
 
new volume ready press february, printed
 till end 1615, interval cervantes put
 together comedies interludes written within last few
 years, and, adds plaintively, found demand among the
 managers, published preface, worth book it
 introduces tenfold, gives account early spanish
 stage, attempts dramatist. needless say
 put forward cervantes good faith full
 confidence merits. reader, however, suppose
 last word final effort drama, in
 hand comedy called “engano ojos,” which, mistook
 not, question.
 
dramatic masterpiece world opportunity judging;
 health failing time, died, apparently of
 dropsy, 23rd april, 1616, day england lost
 shakespeare, nominally least, english calendar yet
 reformed. died lived, accepting lot bravely and
 cheerfully.
 
unhappy life, cervantes? biographers tell us
 was; must say doubt it. hard life, life of
 poverty, incessant struggle, toil ill paid, disappointment,
 cervantes carried within antidote evils.
 one light natures rise adversity merely
 virtue buoyancy; fortitude high
 spirit proof it. impossible conceive
 cervantes giving way despondency prostrated dejection. for
 poverty, thing laughed over, sigh
 ever allows escape says, “happy heaven
 given piece bread bound give thanks to
 heaven itself.” add vital energy mental
 activity, restless invention sanguine temperament, and
 will reason enough doubt whether very
 unhappy life. take cervantes’ distresses together his
 apparatus enduring make bad bargain, perhaps,
 far happiness life concerned.
 
burial-place nothing known except buried, in
 accordance will, neighbouring convent trinitarian
 nuns, supposed daughter, isabel saavedra, an
 inmate, years afterwards nuns removed another
 convent, carrying dead them. whether remains of
 cervantes included removal one knows, the
 clue resting-place now lost beyond hope. furnishes
 perhaps least defensible items charge neglect

 good deal exaggeration. listen biographers one

 plays manifestly comply primary condition of

scramble copies which, seen, followed immediately on

‘don quixote’
 

nine editions first part “don quixote” already appeared
 cervantes died, thirty thousand copies all, according his
 estimate, tenth printed barcelona year his
 death. large number naturally supplied demand time,
 1634 appears exhausted; time down
 present day stream editions continued flow rapidly
 regularly. translations show still clearly request
 book outset. seven years the
 completion work translated four leading
 languages europe. except bible, fact, book so
 widely diffused “don quixote.” “imitatio christi” may been
 translated many different languages, perhaps “robinson
 crusoe” “vicar wakefield” nearly many, in
 multiplicity translations editions “don quixote” leaves all
 far behind.
 
still remarkable character wide diffusion. “don
 quixote” thoroughly naturalised among people whose ideas about
 knight-errantry, all, vaguest, had
 never seen heard book chivalry, possibly feel
 humour burlesque sympathise author’s purpose.
 another curious fact this, cosmopolitan book the
 world, one intensely national. “manon lescaut” not
 thoroughly french, “tom jones” english, “rob roy” not
 scotch, “don quixote” spanish, character, ideas, in
 sentiment, local colour, everything. what, then, secret of
 unparalleled popularity, increasing year year well-nigh
 three centuries? one explanation, doubt, books in
 world, “don quixote” catholic. something it
 every sort reader, young old, sage simple, high low. as
 cervantes says touch pride, “it thumbed read
 got heart people sorts; children turn leaves,
 young people read it, grown men understand it, old folk
 praise it.”
 
idle deny ingredient which, its
 humour, wisdom, fertility invention knowledge of
 human nature displays, insured success multitude,
 vein farce runs it. attack upon the
 sheep, battle wine-skins, mambrino’s helmet, balsam of
 fierabras, don quixote knocked sails windmill,
 sancho tossed blanket, mishaps misadventures master
 man, originally great attraction, perhaps so
 still extent majority readers. plain that
 “don quixote” generally regarded first, indeed spain for
 long time, little queer droll book, full laughable
 incidents absurd situations, amusing, entitled much
 consideration care. editions printed spain 1637 to
 1771, famous printer ibarra took up, mere trade
 editions, badly carelessly printed vile paper got the
 style chap-books intended popular use, with, most
 instances, uncouth illustrations clap-trap additions the
 publisher.
 
england belongs credit first country to
 recognise right “don quixote” better treatment this. the
 london edition 1738, commonly called lord carteret’s having
 suggested him, mere _édition luxe_. produced
 “don quixote” becoming form regards paper type, and
 embellished plates which, particularly happy as
 illustrations, least well intentioned well executed, it
 also aimed correctness text, matter nobody except the
 editors valencia brussels editions given even passing
 thought; first attempt fairly successful, though
 emendations inadmissible, good many been
 adopted subsequent editors.
 
zeal publishers, editors, annotators brought a
 remarkable change sentiment regard “don quixote.” vast
 number admirers began grow ashamed laughing it. it
 became almost crime treat humorous book. humour was
 entirely denied, but, according new view, rated an
 altogether secondary quality, mere accessory, nothing the
 stalking-horse presentation cervantes shot his
 philosophy satire, whatever meant shoot; on
 point opinions varied. agreed, however, object
 aimed books chivalry. said emphatically the
 preface first part last sentence second, that
 object view discredit books, this,
 advanced criticism, made clear object must been
 something else.
 
one theory book kind allegory, setting forth the
 eternal struggle ideal real, spirit of
 poetry spirit prose; perhaps german philosophy never
 evolved ungainly unlikely camel depths its
 inner consciousness. something antagonism, doubt, be
 found “don quixote,” found everywhere life,
 cervantes drew life. difficult imagine community in
 never-ceasing game cross-purposes sancho panza and
 don quixote recognised true nature. stone
 age, among lake dwellers, among cave men, don
 quixotes sancho panzas; must troglodyte who
 never see facts eyes, troglodyte could
 see nothing else. suppose cervantes deliberately setting himself
 expound idea two stout quarto volumes suppose
 something unlike age lived, but
 altogether unlike cervantes himself, first to
 laugh attempt sort made anyone else.
 
extraordinary influence romances chivalry day is
 quite enough account genesis book. idea the
 prodigious development branch literature sixteenth
 century may obtained scrutiny chapter vii, reader
 bears mind portion romances belonging far

 abundant evidence. time amadises and
 palmerins began grow popular end century,
 steady stream invective, men whose character and
 position lend weight words, romances chivalry
 infatuation readers. ridicule besom to
 sweep away dust.
 
task cervantes set himself, ample
 provocation urge it, will sufficiently clear who
 look evidence; will also chivalry
 attacked swept away. absurdities that,
 thanks poetry, will repeated end time, no
 greater one saying “cervantes smiled spain’s chivalry away.”
 first place chivalry smile away. spain’s
 chivalry dead century. work done when
 granada fell, chivalry essentially republican nature,
 live rule ferdinand substituted the
 free institutions mediaeval spain. smile away not
 chivalry degrading mockery it.
 
true nature “right arm” “bright array,” before
 which, according poet, “the world gave ground,” which
 cervantes’ single laugh demolished, may gathered words of
 one countrymen, don felix pacheco, reported captain
 george carleton, “military memoirs 1672 1713.” “before
 appearance world labour cervantes,” said, “it
 next impossibility man walk streets any
 delight without danger. seen many cavaliers prancing
 curvetting windows mistresses, stranger
 imagined whole nation nothing less a
 race knight-errants. world became little acquainted
 notable history, man seen once
 celebrated drapery pointed don quixote, found himself
 jest high low. verily believe this, this
 only, owe dampness poverty spirit run through
 councils century past, little agreeable those
 nobler actions famous ancestors.”
 
call “don quixote” sad book, preaching pessimist view life,
 argues total misconception drift. moral
 that, world, true enthusiasm naturally leads ridicule
 discomfiture. preaches nothing sort; moral, so
 far can said one, spurious enthusiasm that
 born vanity self-conceit, made end itself, not
 means end, acts mere impulse, regardless of
 circumstances consequences, mischievous owner, very
 considerable nuisance community large. cannot
 distinguish one kind other, doubt “don quixote”
 sad book; doubt minds sad man had
 just uttered beautiful sentiment “it hard case to
 make slaves god nature made free,” be
 ungratefully pelted scoundrels crazy philanthropy let
 loose society; others judicial cast will a
 matter regret reckless self-sufficient enthusiasm not
 oftener requited way mischief the
 world.
 
slight examination structure “don quixote” will
 suffice show cervantes deep design elaborate plan in
 mind began book. wrote lines which
 “with strokes great master sets us pauper
 gentleman,” idea goal imagination was
 leading him. can little doubt contemplated a
 short tale range already written, tale setting
 forth ludicrous results might expected follow the
 attempt crazy gentleman act part knight-errant in
 modern life.
 
plain, one thing, sancho panza enter the
 original scheme, cervantes thought certainly would
 omitted hero’s outfit, obviously meant to
 complete. owe landlord’s chance remark chapter iii
 knights seldom travelled without squires. try think don
 quixote without sancho panza like trying think one-bladed
 pair scissors.
 
story written first, like others, without division
 without intervention cid hamete benengeli; seems not
 unlikely cervantes intention bringing dulcinea, or
 aldonza lorenzo, scene person. probably ransacking
 don’s library discussion books chivalry that
 first suggested idea capable development.
 what, instead mere string farcical misadventures, to
 make tale burlesque one books, caricaturing their
 style, incidents, spirit?
 
pursuance change plan, hastily somewhat clumsily
 divided written chapters model “amadis,”
 invented fable mysterious arabic manuscript, set cid
 hamete benengeli imitation almost invariable practice the
 chivalry-romance authors, fond tracing books some
 recondite source. working new ideas, soon found value
 sancho panza. indeed, keynote, sancho’s part, to
 whole book, struck first words sancho utters he
 announces intention taking ass him. “about ass,” we
 told, “don quixote hesitated little, trying whether call

 ass-back; instance occurred memory.” can see whole
 scene glance, stolid unconsciousness sancho the
 perplexity master, upon whose perception incongruity has
 just forced itself. sancho’s mission throughout book; is
 unconscious mephistopheles, always unwittingly making mockery his
 master’s aspirations, always exposing fallacy ideas some
 unintentional ad absurdum, always bringing back world of
 fact commonplace force sheer stolidity.
 
time cervantes got volume novels hands, and
 summoned resolution enough set second part earnest,
 case much altered. don quixote sancho panza not
 merely found favour, already become, never since
 ceased be, veritable entities popular imagination. was
 occasion now interpolate extraneous matter; nay, his
 readers told plainly wanted don

 madness makes virtuous.

 hero’s madness strictly confined delusions subject of
 chivalry, every subject discreto, one, fact,
 whose faculty discernment perfect order. advantage this
 enabled make use don quixote mouthpiece for

 commonplace book.
 
true amount individuality bestowed upon don quixote not

 first part displays great natural gift lying. lies are
 highly imaginative sort liars fiction commonly
 indulge in; like falstaff’s, resemble father begets them;
 simple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, short. but
 service master don quixote develops rapidly, as
 see comes palm three country wenches dulcinea
 ladies waiting. worth noticing how, flushed his

second part spirit rather incidents the

 like everything else romances, gross exaggeration of

 writers like feliciano silva. cervantes deals with
 don quixote’s passion dulcinea, instance he
 carried burlesque happily. keeping dulcinea the
 background, making vague shadowy whose very
 existence left doubt, invests don quixote’s worship her
 virtues charms additional extravagance, gives still
 point caricature sentiment language the
 romances.
 
one great merits “don quixote,” one qualities that
 secured acceptance classes readers made the
 cosmopolitan books, simplicity. are, course,
 points obvious enough spanish seventeenth century audience which
 immediately strike reader now-a-days, cervantes often
 takes granted allusion will generally understood
 intelligible few. example, many his
 readers spain, readers it, significance
 choice country hero completely lost. be
 going far say one can thoroughly comprehend “don
 quixote” without seen mancha, undoubtedly even glimpse
 mancha will give insight meaning cervantes as
 commentator can give. regions spain last
 suggest idea romance. dull central plateau
 peninsula dullest tract. something impressive
 grim solitudes estremadura; plains leon and
 old castile bald dreary, studded old cities
 renowned history rich relics past. no
 redeeming feature manchegan landscape; sameness
 desert without dignity; towns villages that
 break monotony mean commonplace, nothing venerable
 them, even picturesqueness poverty; indeed,
 don quixote’s village, argamasilla, sort oppressive
 respectability prim regularity streets houses;
 everything ignoble; windmills ugliest shabbiest
 windmill kind.
 
anyone knew country well, mere style title “don
 quixote mancha” gave key author’s meaning once. la
 mancha knight’s country scene chivalries a
 piece pasteboard helmet, farm-labourer ass-back a
 squire, knighthood conferred rascally ventero, convicts taken for

strange element incongruity, underlying whole

 majority undertaken interpret “don quixote.”

 sure, great majority artists illustrated “don
 quixote” knew nothing whatever spain. venta conveyed no

 therefore full justice humour don quixote’s misconception
 taking castle, perceive remoteness its
 realities ideal. even better informed seem to
 apprehension full force discrepancy. take, for
 instance, gustave doré’s drawing don quixote watching armour in
 inn-yard. whether venta quesada seville road
 is, tradition maintains, inn described “don quixote,” beyond
 question just inn-yard one behind that
 cervantes mind’s eye, just rude stone
 trough beside primitive draw-well corner he
 meant don quixote deposit armour. gustave doré makes an
 elaborate fountain arriero ever watered mules the
 corral venta spain, thereby entirely misses point
 aimed cervantes. mean, prosaic, commonplace character
 surroundings circumstances gives significance to
 don quixote’s vigil ceremony follows.
 
cervantes’ humour part broader simpler
 sort, strength lies perception incongruous.
 incongruity sancho ways, words, works, with
 ideas aims master, quite much wonderful
 vitality truth nature character, makes most
 humorous creation whole range fiction. unsmiling gravity
 cervantes first great master, “cervantes’ serious
 air,” sits naturally swift alone, perhaps, later
 humourists, essential kind humour, again
 cervantes suffered hands interpreters. nothing,
 unless indeed coarse buffoonery phillips, of
 place attempt represent cervantes, flippant, would-be
 facetious style, like motteux’s version example, the
 sprightly, jaunty air, french translators sometimes adopt. the
 grave matter-of-factness narrative, apparent
 unconsciousness author saying anything ludicrous,
 anything merest commonplace, give peculiar flavour to
 humour cervantes. his, fact, exact opposite the
 humour sterne self-conscious humourists. even uncle
 toby best, always aware “the man sterne” behind
 him, watching shoulder see effect producing.
 cervantes always leaves alone don quixote sancho. and
 swift great humourists always keep sight, or,
 properly speaking, never think all, unlike our
 latter-day school humourists, seem revived old
 horse-collar method, try raise laugh grotesque
 assumption ignorance, imbecility, bad taste.
 
true full justice spanish humour other
 language well-nigh impossibility. natural gravity and
 sonorous stateliness spanish, ever colloquial, that
 make absurdity doubly absurd, give plausibility most
 preposterous statement. makes sancho panza’s drollery the
 despair conscientious translator. sancho’s curt comments can
 never fall flat, lose half flavour transferred from
 native castilian medium. foreigners have
 failed justice humour cervantes, worse than
 countrymen. indeed, spanish peasant’s
 relish “don quixote,” one might tempted think great
 humourist looked upon humourist country.
 
craze don quixote seems, instances, communicated
 critics, making see things book
 run full tilt phantoms existence save own
 imaginations. like good many critics now-a-days, forget that
 screams criticism, vulgar tastes are
 influenced strings superlatives, three-piled hyperboles, and
 pompous epithets. strikes one particularly strange that
 deal extravagant eulogies, ascribe manner of
 imaginary ideas qualities cervantes, show perception of
 quality ninety-nine hundred readers rate
 highest him, hold one raises all
 rivalry.
 
speak “don quixote” merely humorous book be
 manifest misdescription. cervantes times makes kind of
 commonplace book occasional essays criticisms, the
 observations reflections gathered wisdom long stirring
 life. mine shrewd observation mankind human nature.
 among modern novels may be, there, elaborate
 studies character, book richer individualised
 character. coleridge said shakespeare minimis true of
 cervantes; never, even temporary purpose, puts forward
 lay figure. life individuality characters,
 however little may do, however short time may be
 reader. samson carrasco, curate, teresa panza,
 altisidora, even two students met road cave of
 montesinos, live move being; is
 characteristic broad humanity cervantes a
 hateful one among all. even poor maritornes, deplorable
 morals, kind heart “some faint distant
 resemblance christian her;” sancho, though on
 dissection fail find lovable trait him, unless sort
 dog-like affection master, heart
 love him?
 
is, all, humour “don quixote” distinguishes it
 books romance kind. makes it, as
 one judicial-minded modern critics calls it, “the best
 novel world beyond comparison.” varied humour,
 ranging broad farce comedy subtle shakespeare’s or
 molière’s naturalised every country are

 belonging knight famous, one merits own,
 without distinctive name, strove adapt so
 indicate belonging knight-errant,
 was; reasonable that, master
 taking new character, take new name, should
 distinguished full-sounding one, befitting new order and
 calling follow. so, composed, struck
 out, rejected, added to, unmade, remade multitude names of
 memory fancy, decided upon calling rocinante, name, to
 thinking, lofty, sonorous, significant condition a
 hack became now was, first foremost all
 hacks world.
 
got name horse much taste, anxious to
 get one himself, eight days pondering this
 point, till last made mind call “don quixote,”
 whence, already said, authors veracious history
 inferred name must beyond doubt quixada, and
 quesada others it. recollecting, however, the
 valiant amadis content call curtly amadis and
 nothing more, added name kingdom country make it
 famous, called amadis gaul, he, like good knight,
 resolved add name his, style don quixote of
 mancha, whereby, considered, described accurately origin
 country, honour taking surname it.
 
then, armour furbished, morion turned helmet,
 hack christened, confirmed, came the
 conclusion nothing needed now look lady
 love with; knight-errant without love like tree
 without leaves fruit, body without soul. said to
 himself, “if, sins, good fortune, come across some
 giant hereabouts, common occurrence knights-errant, and
 overthrow one onslaught, cleave asunder waist, or,
 short, vanquish subdue him, will well someone
 may send present, may come fall his
 knees sweet lady, humble, submissive voice say, ‘i
 giant caraculiambro, lord island malindrania,
 vanquished single combat never sufficiently extolled knight
 don quixote mancha, commanded present before

 good gentleman enjoyed delivery speech, especially
 thought someone call lady! was, the
 story goes, village near good-looking farm-girl
 one time love, though, far known,
 never knew gave thought matter. name was
 aldonza lorenzo, upon thought fit confer title of
 lady thoughts; search name not
 harmony own, suggest indicate of
 princess great lady, decided upon calling dulcinea del
 toboso—she toboso—a name, mind, musical, uncommon,
 significant, like already bestowed upon himself
 things belonging him.

 grievances redress, injustices repair, abuses remove, and

 anyone, without anybody seeing him, one morning dawning

 donned suit armour, mounted rocinante patched-up helmet
 on, braced buckler, took lance, back door the

 satisfaction seeing ease made beginning his
 grand purpose. scarcely find upon open plain,
 terrible thought struck him, one enough make him

 neither bear arms knight; that

 example others case, read books that
 brought pass. white armour, resolved, the
 first opportunity, scour whiter ermine; and
 comforting pursued way, taking horse

thus setting out, new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to
 saying, “who knows time come, the
 veracious history famous deeds made known, sage writes
 it, set forth first sally early morning, will

 presently broke again, love-stricken earnest,
 “o princess dulcinea, lady captive heart, grievous wrong hast
 thou done drive forth scorn, inexorable obduracy
 banish presence thy beauty. lady, deign hold in

went stringing together absurdities, in

 prodigious satisfaction rode inn ladies, who,

 straining eyes make features clumsy visor

 much line, restrain laughter, which
 made don quixote wax indignant, say, “modesty becomes fair, and
 moreover laughter little cause great silliness; this,
 however, say pain anger you, desire none other

incomprehensible language unpromising looks cavalier
 increased ladies’ laughter, increased irritation,
 matters might gone farther moment landlord had
 come out, who, fat man, peaceful one. he,
 seeing grotesque figure clad armour match more

 but, truth, standing awe complicated armament, he
 thought best speak fairly, said, “señor caballero, if
 worship wants lodging, bating bed (for one the
 inn) plenty everything else here.” don quixote, observing
 respectful bearing alcaide fortress (for innkeeper
 inn seemed eyes), made answer, “sir castellan, me
 anything will suffice, for
 
‘my armour wear,

host fancied called castellan took a

“oh, never, surely, knight

harassed reflection, made haste scanty pothouse

 stable him, fell knees him, saying,
 “from spot rise not, valiant knight, courtesy grants
 boon seek, one will redound praise the
 benefit human race.” landlord, seeing guest feet
 hearing speech kind, stood staring in
 bewilderment, knowing say, entreating to
 rise, purpose agreed grant boon
 demanded him. “i looked less, lord, high
 magnificence,” replied don quixote, “and tell the
 boon asked liberality granted shall dub
 knight to-morrow morning, to-night shall watch arms in
 chapel castle; thus to-morrow, said, will be
 accomplished much desire, enabling lawfully roam
 four quarters world seeking adventures behalf
 distress, duty chivalry knights-errant
 like myself, whose ambition directed deeds.”
 
landlord, who, mentioned, something wag, and
 already suspicion guest’s want wits, quite
 convinced hearing talk kind him, make
 sport night determined fall humour. he
 told quite right pursuing object view, and
 motive natural becoming cavaliers as
 distinguished seemed gallant bearing showed be;
 younger days followed same
 honourable calling, roaming quest adventures various parts of
 world, among others curing-grounds malaga, isles of
 riaran, precinct seville, little market segovia, the
 olivera valencia, rondilla granada, strand san lucar,
 colt cordova, taverns toledo, divers quarters,
 proved nimbleness feet lightness his
 fingers, many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids and
 swindling minors, and, short, bringing notice of
 almost every tribunal court justice spain; last he
 retired castle his, living upon his
 property upon others; received all
 knights-errant whatever rank condition might be, the
 great love bore might share substance with
 return benevolence. told him, moreover, this
 castle chapel watch armour,
 pulled order rebuilt, case
 necessity might, knew, watched anywhere, might watch
 night courtyard castle, morning, god
 willing, requisite ceremonies might performed him
 dubbed knight, thoroughly dubbed nobody so.
 asked money him, don quixote replied
 farthing, histories knights-errant he
 never read carrying any. point landlord
 told mistaken; for, though recorded histories,
 author’s opinion need mention anything
 obvious necessary money clean shirts, be
 supposed therefore carry them, might regard it
 certain established knights-errant (about there
 many full unimpeachable books) carried well-furnished
 purses case emergency, likewise carried shirts little
 box ointment cure wounds received. plains
 deserts engaged combat came wounded, was
 always someone cure them, unless indeed had
 friend sage magician succour fetching
 air upon cloud damsel dwarf vial water
 virtue tasting one drop cured their
 hurts wounds instant left sound not
 received damage whatever. case occur, the
 knights old took care see squires provided with
 money requisites, lint ointments healing
 purposes; happened knights squires (which was
 rarely seldom case) carried everything in
 cunning saddle-bags hardly seen horse’s croup, if
 something else importance, because, unless some
 reason, carrying saddle-bags favourably regarded
 among knights-errant. therefore advised (and, godson so
 soon be, might even command him) never time forth to
 travel without money usual requirements, find the
 advantage least expected it.
 
don quixote promised follow advice scrupulously, was
 arranged forthwith watch armour large yard at
 one side inn; so, collecting together, don quixote placed
 trough stood side well, bracing his
 buckler arm grasped lance began stately air to
 march front trough, began march
 night began fall.
 
landlord told people inn craze of
 guest, watching armour, dubbing ceremony he
 contemplated. full wonder strange form madness, they
 flocked see distance, observed composure he
 sometimes paced down, sometimes, leaning lance, gazed
 armour without taking eyes ever long; as
 night closed light moon brilliant it
 might vie lent it, everything novice knight was
 plainly seen all.
 
meanwhile one carriers inn thought fit water
 team, necessary remove don quixote’s armour lay
 trough; seeing approach hailed loud
 voice, “o thou, whoever thou art, rash knight comest lay hands
 armour valorous errant ever girt sword, have
 care thou dost; touch unless thou wouldst lay thy
 life penalty thy rashness.” carrier gave heed these
 words (and done better heed been
 heedful health), seizing straps flung armour
 distance him. seeing this, don quixote raised eyes to
 heaven, fixing thoughts, apparently, upon lady dulcinea,
 exclaimed, “aid me, lady mine, first encounter that
 presents breast thou holdest subjection; let
 thy favour protection fail first jeopardy;” and,
 words others purpose, dropping buckler
 lifted lance hands smote blow on
 carrier’s head stretched ground, stunned that
 followed second need a
 surgeon cure him. done, picked armour returned to
 beat serenity before.

shortly this, another, knowing happened (for the
 carrier still lay senseless), came object giving water
 mules, proceeding remove armour order clear
 trough, don quixote, without uttering word imploring aid
 anyone, dropped buckler lifted his
 lance, without actually breaking second carrier’s head into
 pieces, made three it, laid open four. the
 noise people inn ran spot, among the
 landlord. seeing this, don quixote braced buckler arm, and
 hand sword exclaimed, “o lady beauty, strength and
 support faint heart, time thee turn eyes thy
 greatness thy captive knight brink mighty an
 adventure.” felt inspired have
 flinched carriers world assailed him. the
 comrades wounded perceiving plight began a
 distance shower stones don quixote, screened best
 buckler, daring quit trough leave his
 armour unprotected. landlord shouted leave alone,
 already told mad, madman would
 accountable even killed all. still louder shouted don
 quixote, calling knaves traitors, lord castle,
 allowed knights-errant treated fashion, villain and
 low-born knight whom, received order knighthood, he
 call account treachery. “but you,” cried, “base
 vile rabble, make account; fling, strike, come on, ye
 can me, ye shall see reward folly and
 insolence will be.” uttered much spirit boldness
 filled assailants terrible fear, much for
 reason persuasion landlord left stoning
 him, allowed carry wounded, same
 calmness composure resumed watch armour.
 
freaks guest much liking the
 landlord, determined cut matters short confer upon at
 unlucky order knighthood misadventure
 occur; so, going him, apologised rudeness which,
 without knowledge, offered low people,
 who, however, well punished audacity. had
 already told him, said, chapel castle, was
 needed remained done, for, understood the
 ceremonial order, whole point dubbed knight lay
 accolade slap shoulder, be
 administered middle field; now done all
 needful watching armour, requirements were
 satisfied watch two hours only, than
 four it. don quixote believed all, told stood there
 ready obey him, make end much despatch as
 possible; for, attacked, felt dubbed
 knight, not, thought, leave soul alive castle,
 except respect might spare bidding.
 
thus warned menaced, castellan forthwith brought book in
 used enter straw barley served the
 carriers, and, lad carrying candle-end, two damsels
 already mentioned, returned don quixote stood, bade him
 kneel down. then, reading account-book repeating
 devout prayer, middle delivery raised hand
 gave sturdy blow neck, then, sword, a
 smart slap shoulder, muttering teeth
 saying prayers. done this, directed one of
 ladies gird sword, great
 self-possession gravity, little required prevent a
 burst laughter stage ceremony; had
 already seen novice knight’s prowess kept laughter within
 bounds. girding sword worthy lady said him, “may
 god make worship fortunate knight, grant success in
 battle.” don quixote asked name order might that
 time forward know beholden favour had
 received, meant confer upon portion honour he
 acquired might arm. answered great humility that
 called tolosa, daughter cobbler of
 toledo lived stalls sanchobienaya, wherever she
 might serve esteem lord. don quixote said
 reply favour thenceforward assumed
 “don” called doña tolosa. promised would, and
 buckled spur, followed almost the
 conversation lady sword. asked name, and
 said molinera, daughter a
 respectable miller antequera; likewise don quixote
 requested adopt “don” call doña
 molinera, making offers services favours.
 
thus, hot haste speed, brought conclusion these
 never-till-now-seen ceremonies, don quixote thorns saw
 horseback sallying forth quest adventures; and
 saddling rocinante mounted, embracing host, he
 returned thanks kindness knighting him, addressed in
 language extraordinary impossible convey idea it

day dawning don quixote quitted inn, happy, gay, so

 like burst horse-girths. however, recalling advice his
 host requisites carry him, especially that
 referring money shirts, determined go home provide

 well qualified office squire knight. object
 turned horse’s head towards village, rocinante, thus
 reminded old quarters, stepped briskly hardly

gone far, thicket right seemed to
 come feeble cries someone distress, instant heard
 exclaimed, “thanks heaven favour accords me,

 wood, saw mare tied oak, tied another, and
 stripped waist upwards, youth fifteen years age,
 cries came. without cause, lusty
 farmer flogging belt following every blow with
 scoldings commands, repeating, “your mouth shut eyes
 open!” youth made answer, “i won’t again, master mine;
 god’s passion won’t again, i’ll take care the
 flock another time.”
 
seeing going on, don quixote said angry voice,
 “discourteous knight, ill becomes assail one cannot
 defend himself; mount steed take lance” (for a
 lance leaning oak mare tied), “and will
 make know behaving coward.” farmer, seeing
 figure full armour brandishing lance his
 head, gave dead, made answer meekly, “sir knight,
 youth chastising servant, employed watch
 flock sheep hard by, careless lose
 one every day, punish carelessness knavery
 says niggardliness, escape paying wages i

“lies me, base clown!” said don quixote. “by sun shines

farmer hung head, without word untied servant, of

replied, nine months seven reals month. don quixote added it
 up, found came sixty-three reals, told farmer pay
 immediately, want die it.
 
trembling clown replied lived oath had
 sworn (though sworn any) much; were
 taken account deducted three pairs shoes given
 him, real two blood-lettings sick.
 
“all well,” said don quixote; “but let shoes the
 blood-lettings stand setoff blows given him
 without cause; spoiled leather shoes paid
 for, damaged body, barber took blood
 sick, drawn sound; on
 score owes nothing.”
 
“the difficulty is, sir knight, money here; let andres
 come home me, will pay all, real real.”
 
“i go him!” said youth. “nay, god forbid! no, señor, for
 world; alone me, flay like saint
 bartholomew.”
 
“he will nothing kind,” said don quixote; “i to
 command, will obey me; sworn order of
 knighthood received, leave free, guarantee the
 payment.”
 
“consider saying, señor,” said youth; “this master of
 mine knight, received order knighthood; for
 juan haldudo rich, quintanar.”
 
“that matters little,” replied don quixote; “there may haldudos
 knights; moreover, everyone works.”
 
“that true,” said andres; “but master mine—of works is
 son, refuses wages sweat labour?”
 
“i refuse, brother andres,” said farmer, “be good enough to
 come along me, swear orders knighthood there
 world pay agreed, real real, and
 perfumed.”
 
“for perfumery excuse you,” said don quixote; “give in
 reals, shall satisfied; see sworn;
 not, oath swear come back hunt and
 punish you; shall find though lie closer a
 lizard. desire know lays command upon you,
 firmly bound obey it, know valorous
 don quixote mancha, undoer wrongs injustices; so,
 god you, keep mind promised sworn
 penalties already declared you.”
 
saying, gave rocinante spur soon reach. the
 farmer followed eyes, saw cleared
 wood longer sight, turned boy andres, and
 said, “come here, son, want pay owe you, that
 undoer wrongs commanded me.”
 
“my oath it,” said andres, “your worship will well advised to
 obey command good knight—may live thousand years—for,
 valiant just judge, roque, pay me, he
 will come back said.”
 
“my oath it, too,” said farmer; “but strong
 affection you, want add debt order add the
 payment;” seizing arm, tied again, gave
 flogging left dead.
 
“now, master andres,” said farmer, “call undoer wrongs;
 will find won’t undo that, though sure have
 quite done you, good mind flay alive.” at
 last untied him, gave leave go look judge in
 order put sentence pronounced execution.
 
andres went rather mouth, swearing go look
 valiant don quixote mancha tell exactly had
 happened, repaid sevenfold; for
 that, went weeping, master stood laughing.
 
thus valiant don quixote right wrong, and, thoroughly
 satisfied taken place, considered made a
 happy noble beginning knighthood, took road
 towards village perfect self-content, saying low voice,
 “well mayest thou day call thyself fortunate earth, o
 dulcinea toboso, fairest fair! since fallen thy

 knight renowned will don quixote mancha, who, as
 world knows, yesterday received order knighthood, and
 hath to-day righted greatest wrong grievance ever

“if show you,” replied don quixote, “what merit would
 confessing truth manifest? essential point that
 without seeing must believe, confess, affirm, swear, defend
 it; else ye battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant
 rabble ye are; come ye on, one one order of
 knighthood requires, together custom vile usage of

“sir knight,” replied trader, “i entreat worship name

“she distils nothing kind, vile rabble,” said don quixote,

“hush, gossip,” said curate; “please god, luck may turn, and

“wounded no,” said don quixote, “but bruised battered doubt, for

 first thing go look books, finding the
 room left it, wandered side side looking for
 it. came place door used be, tried with
 hands, turned twisted eyes every direction without
 saying word; good asked housekeeper
 whereabouts room held books.
 
housekeeper, already well instructed was

 looking for? neither room books house now, for
 devil carried away.”
 
“it devil,” said niece, “but magician came a

“he must said friston,” said don quixote.

“who doubts that?” said niece; “but, uncle, mixes in

“oh, niece mine,” replied don quixote, “how much astray art thou in

don quixote next set getting money; selling one thing

“those thou seest there,” answered master, “with long arms, and

“look, worship,” said sancho; “what see giants

“if so,” said sancho, “i nothing say; god knows would

“most certainly, señor,” replied sancho, “your worship shall fully

“that grant,” said don quixote, “but matter aiding me

thus talking appeared road two friars of

“this will worse windmills,” said sancho. “look, señor;

“‘“you will see presently,” said agrajes,’” replied don quixote; and

now time sancho risen, rather worse handling of

don quixote replied, “thou must take notice, brother sancho,

sancho gave many thanks, kissing hand skirt

“peace,” said don quixote; “where hast thou ever seen heard a
 knight-errant arraigned court justice, however
 many homicides may committed?”
 
“i know nothing omecils,” answered sancho, “nor life have
 anything one; know holy brotherhood

“then thou needst uneasiness, friend,” said don quixote,
 “for will deliver thee hands chaldeans, much more

“all might well dispensed with,” said don quixote, “if had

“what vial balsam that?” said sancho panza.
 
“it balsam,” answered don quixote, “the receipt in

“with less three reals, six quarts may made,” said don

“sinner am!” said sancho, “then worship put off

“peace, friend,” answered don quixote; “greater secrets mean teach

hearing this, sancho said him, “your worship bear mind,

“thou art wrong there,” said don quixote, “for shall been

“enough,” said sancho; “so then, god grant us success, and

“i already told thee, sancho,” said don quixote, “not give

hardly day begun show balconies the
 east, five six goatherds came rouse don quixote tell
 still mind go see famous burial of
 chrysostom bear company. don quixote, desired
 nothing better, rose ordered sancho saddle pannel once,
 despatch, set out
 forthwith. gone quarter league meeting
 two paths saw coming towards six shepherds dressed in
 black sheepskins heads crowned garlands cypress
 bitter oleander. carried stout holly staff his
 hand, along came two men quality horseback in
 handsome travelling dress, three servants foot accompanying
 them. courteous salutations exchanged meeting, inquiring
 one way party going, learned all
 bound scene burial, went together.
 
one horseback addressing companion said him, “it
 seems me, señor vivaldo, may reckon well spent delay
 shall incur seeing remarkable funeral, remarkable it
 judging strange things shepherds told
 us, dead shepherd homicide shepherdess.”
 
“so think too,” replied vivaldo, “and delay say day,
 four, sake seeing it.”
 
don quixote asked heard marcela and
 chrysostom. traveller answered morning met
 shepherds, seeing dressed mournful fashion they
 asked reason appearing guise; one
 gave, describing strange behaviour beauty a
 shepherdess called marcela, loves many courted her,
 together death chrysostom whose burial were
 going. short, repeated pedro related don quixote.
 
conversation dropped, another commenced was
 called vivaldo asking don quixote reason led to
 go armed fashion country peaceful. don quixote
 replied, “the pursuit calling allow permit go
 fashion; easy life, enjoyment, repose invented
 soft courtiers, toil, unrest, arms invented made
 alone world calls knights-errant, i, though
 unworthy, least all.”
 
instant heard set mad, better to
 settle point discover kind madness was, vivaldo
 proceeded ask knights-errant meant.
 
“have worships,” replied don quixote, “read annals and
 histories england, recorded famous deeds king
 arthur, popular castilian invariably call king artus,
 regard ancient tradition, commonly received
 kingdom great britain, king die, but
 changed magic art raven, process time he
 return reign recover kingdom sceptre; which
 reason proved time englishman
 ever killed raven? well, then, time good king that
 famous order chivalry knights round table was
 instituted, amour don lancelot lake queen
 guinevere occurred, precisely related, go-between and
 confidante therein highly honourable dame quintañona, whence
 came ballad well known widely spread spain—
 
never surely knight

sweet delectable course achievements love
 war. handed time, then, order chivalry went
 extending spreading many various parts the
 world; it, famous renowned deeds, mighty
 amadis gaul sons descendants fifth
 generation, valiant felixmarte hircania, never
 sufficiently praised tirante blanco, days almost we
 seen heard talked invincible knight don belianis
 greece. this, then, sirs, knight-errant, have
 spoken order chivalry, which, already
 said, i, though sinner, made profession, aforesaid
 knights professed profess, go these
 solitudes wilds seeking adventures, resolved soul oppose my
 arm person perilous fortune may offer aid of
 weak needy.”
 
words travellers able satisfy of
 don quixote’s senses form madness that
 overmastered him, felt astonishment all
 felt first becoming acquainted it; vivaldo, a
 person great shrewdness lively temperament, order to
 beguile short journey said required reach the
 mountain, scene burial, sought give opportunity of
 going absurdities. said him, “it seems me,
 señor knight-errant, worship made choice one the
 austere professions world, imagine even the
 carthusian monks austere.”
 
“as austere may perhaps be,” replied don quixote, “but so
 necessary world much inclined doubt. for, the
 truth told, soldier executes captain orders
 less captain gives order. meaning,
 is, churchmen peace quiet pray heaven welfare of
 world, soldiers knights carry effect pray
 for, defending might arms edge our
 swords, shelter open air, target the
 intolerable rays sun summer piercing frosts of
 winter. thus god’s ministers earth arms his
 justice done therein. business war that
 relates belongs conducted without exceeding great
 sweat, toil, exertion, follows make their
 profession undoubtedly labour tranquil
 peace quiet engaged praying god help weak. do
 mean say, enter thoughts, the
 knight-errant’s calling good monk cell; i
 merely infer endure beyond doubt
 laborious belaboured one, hungrier thirstier, a
 wretcheder, raggeder, lousier; reason doubt that
 knights-errant yore endured much hardship course their
 lives. might arms rise be
 emperors, faith cost dear matter blood sweat;
 attained rank magicians sages
 help completely baulked ambition
 disappointed hopes.”
 
“that opinion,” replied traveller; “but one thing among
 many others seems wrong knights-errant, that
 find engage mighty perilous
 adventure manifest danger losing lives, they
 never moment engaging think commending to
 god, duty every good christian like peril; instead of
 commend ladies much devotion as
 gods, thing seems savour somewhat
 heathenism.”
 
“sir,” answered don quixote, “that account omitted,
 knight-errant disgraced acted otherwise: is
 usual customary knight-errantry knight-errant, on
 engaging great feat arms lady him, turn
 eyes towards softly lovingly, though them
 entreating favour protect hazardous venture is
 undertake, even though one hear him, bound say
 certain words teeth, commending his
 heart, innumerable instances histories. nor
 supposed omit commending
 god, will time opportunity so
 engaged task.”
 
“for that,” answered traveller, “i feel doubt still,
 often read words will arise two
 knights-errant, one thing another comes their
 anger kindles wheel horses round take good stretch
 field, without ado top speed they
 come charge, mid-career wont commend
 ladies; commonly comes encounter is
 one falls haunches horse pierced and
 antagonist’s lance, other, by
 holding mane horse can help falling the
 ground; know dead man time commend to
 god course rapid work this; better
 words spent commending lady the
 midst career devoted duty obligation a
 christian. moreover, belief knights-errant not
 ladies commend to, love.”
 
“that impossible,” said don quixote: “i say impossible that
 knight-errant without lady, as
 natural proper love heavens stars: most
 certainly history seen found a
 knight-errant without amour, simple reason without
 one held legitimate knight bastard, one who
 gained entrance stronghold said knighthood, by
 door, wall like thief robber.”
 
“nevertheless,” said traveller, “if remember rightly, think i
 read don galaor, brother valiant amadis gaul,
 never special lady might commend himself, yet he
 less esteemed, stout famous knight.”
 
don quixote made answer, “sir, one solitary swallow does
 make summer; moreover, know knight secret deeply
 love; besides which, way falling love took
 fancy natural propensity control. but, in
 short, manifest one alone made mistress
 will, commended frequently very
 secretly, prided reticent knight.”
 
“then essential every knight-errant love,”
 said traveller, “it may fairly supposed worship so,
 order; pride as
 reticent don galaor, entreat earnestly can, the
 name company own, inform us name,
 country, rank, beauty lady, will esteem herself
 fortunate world knows loved served a
 knight worship seems be.”
 
don quixote heaved deep sigh said, “i say
 positively whether sweet enemy pleased world
 know serve her; can say answer so
 courteously asked me, name dulcinea, country el
 toboso, village mancha, rank must least a
 princess, since queen lady, beauty superhuman,
 since impossible fanciful attributes beauty the

 suns, cheeks roses, lips coral, teeth pearls, neck
 alabaster, bosom marble, hands ivory, fairness snow, and
 modesty conceals sight such, think imagine, rational
 reflection can extol, compare.”
 
“we like know lineage, race, ancestry,” said vivaldo.
 
don quixote replied, “she ancient roman curtii,
 caii, scipios, modern colonnas orsini, the
 moncadas requesenes catalonia, yet rebellas or
 villanovas valencia; palafoxes, nuzas, rocabertis, corellas, lunas,

“although mine cachopins laredo,” said traveller, “i
 will venture compare toboso mancha,
 though, tell truth, surname now ever reached
 ears.”
 
“what!” said don quixote, “has never reached them?”
 
rest party went along listening great attention the
 conversation pair, even goatherds shepherds
 perceived exceedingly wits don quixote was. sancho
 panza alone thought master said truth, knowing
 known birth; felt
 difficulty believing fair dulcinea del
 toboso, neither name princess ever

 going along conversing way, saw descending gap
 two high mountains twenty shepherds, clad in
 sheepskins black wool, crowned garlands which, as
 afterwards appeared, were, yew, cypress. six of
 number carrying bier covered great variety flowers
 branches, seeing one goatherds said, “those who
 come bearers chrysostom’s body, foot that
 mountain place ordered bury him.” they
 therefore made haste reach spot, time those
 came laid bier upon ground, four sharp
 pickaxes digging grave side hard rock. greeted
 courteously, don quixote accompanied
 turned examine bier, it, covered flowers, they
 saw dead body dress shepherd, appearance one
 thirty years age, showing even death life been
 comely features gallant bearing. around bier itself
 laid books, several papers open folded; who
 looking well opening grave the
 others preserved strange silence, one those
 borne body said another, “observe carefully, ambrosio if

 directed will strictly complied with.”
 
“this place,” answered ambrosio “for many time my

 me, saw first time mortal enemy human race,
 here, too, first time declared passion, as

 don quixote travellers went say, “that body, sirs, on

 unapproached gentle bearing, phœnix friendship, generous
 without limit, grave without arrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, in
 short, first constitutes goodness second none all

 wind, cried wilderness, served ingratitude, for
 reward made prey death mid-course life, cut short
 shepherdess sought immortalise memory man, as
 papers see fully prove, commanded me
 consign fire consigned body the

“you deal harshly cruelly owner

 reasonable augustus cæsar permitted directions left

 señor ambrosio consign friend’s body earth, you

without waiting shepherd’s answer, stretched his

vivaldo, eager see papers contained, opened one of

“lay chrysostom” met approbation listeners,
 though reader said seem agree had
 heard marcela’s reserve propriety, chrysostom complained in
 jealousy, suspicion, absence, prejudice the
 good name fame marcela; ambrosio replied one who
 knew well friend’s secret thoughts, “señor, remove that
 doubt tell unhappy man wrote lay was
 away marcela, voluntarily separated himself, to
 try absence act wont; everything
 distresses every fear haunts banished lover, imaginary
 jealousies suspicions, dreaded true, tormented
 chrysostom; thus truth report declares virtue of
 marcela remains unshaken, envy and
 find fault save cruel, somewhat haughty, and
 scornful.”
 
“that true,” said vivaldo; read another paper
 preserved fire, stopped marvellous
 vision (for seemed) unexpectedly presented their
 eyes; summit rock digging grave
 appeared shepherdess marcela, beautiful beauty
 exceeded reputation. never till beheld gazed
 upon wonder silence, accustomed see
 less amazed never seen before. but
 instant ambrosio saw addressed her, manifest
 indignation:
 
“art thou come, chance, cruel basilisk mountains, see if
 thy presence blood will flow wounds wretched being
 thy cruelty robbed life; exult cruel work
 thy humours thou art come; like another pitiless nero to
 look height upon ruin rome embers; in
 thy arrogance trample ill-fated corpse, ungrateful
 daughter trampled father tarquin’s? tell us quickly what
 thou art come, thou wouldst have, for, know the
 thoughts chrysostom never failed obey thee life, will make
 call friends obey thee, though be
 dead.”
 
“i come not, ambrosio purposes thou hast named,” replied
 marcela, “but defend prove unreasonable all
 blame sorrow chrysostom’s death; and
 therefore ask give attention, for
 will take much time many words bring truth home to
 persons sense. heaven made me, say, beautiful, so
 much spite beauty leads love me; and
 love show say, even urge, bound to
 love you. natural understanding god given know
 everything beautiful attracts love, see how, by
 reason loved, loved beauty bound to
 love loves it; besides, may happen lover that
 beautiful may ugly, ugliness detestable, is
 absurd say, “i love thee thou art beautiful, thou must
 love though ugly.” supposing beauty equal both
 sides, follow inclinations must therefore
 alike, every beauty excites love, pleasing
 eye without winning affection; every sort beauty
 excited love won heart, will wander vaguely and
 fro unable make choice any; infinity of
 beautiful objects must infinity inclinations, true
 love, heard said, indivisible, must voluntary and
 compelled. so, believe be, desire
 bend will force, reason say you

 beautiful, justice complain loving me?
 moreover, must remember beauty possess choice of

 asking choosing it; viper, though kills it,

words, waiting hear reply, turned and

 lost admiration much good sense her

 bright eyes—made though follow her, heedless frank
 declaration heard; seeing which, deeming fitting

 don quixote, laying hand hilt sword, exclaimed a
 loud distinct voice:
 
“let one, whatever rank condition, dare follow the
 beautiful marcela, pain incurring fierce indignation. she

 shepherds moved stirred spot until, finished the
 grave burned chrysostom’s papers, laid body it, not
 without many tears stood by. closed grave with

master said reply, “i wish breath enough to
 speak somewhat easily, pain feel side would
 abate let explain thee, panza, mistake thou makest.
 come now, sinner, suppose wind fortune, hitherto adverse,
 turn favour, filling sails desires that
 safely without impediment put port one those

“in now befallen us,” answered sancho, “i’d well

 virtuous person quiet myself. all, say right
 takes long time come know people, is
 nothing sure life. said that, mighty
 slashes worship gave unlucky knight-errant, was
 coming, travelling post heels them, great
 storm sticks fallen upon shoulders?”
 
“and yet thine, sancho,” replied don quixote, “ought used such
 squalls; mine, reared soft cloth fine linen, plain
 must feel keenly pain mishap, not
 imagine—why say imagine?—know certainty these
 annoyances necessary accompaniments calling arms, i
 lay die pure vexation.”
 
squire replied, “señor, mishaps one reaps
 chivalry, tell happen often, their
 fixed times coming pass; seems after
 two harvests shall good third, unless god his
 infinite mercy helps us.”
 
“know, friend sancho,” answered don quixote, “that life of
 knights-errant subject thousand dangers reverses, and
 neither less within immediate possibility for
 knights-errant become kings emperors, experience shown in
 case many different knights whose histories thoroughly
 acquainted; tell thee now, pain let me, of
 simply might arm risen high stations have
 mentioned; same, after, experienced divers
 misfortunes miseries; valiant amadis gaul found himself

 positively asserted, holding captive, gave two
 hundred lashes reins horse tied one the

 certain pitfall, opened feet certain castle, on
 falling found bound hand foot deep pit underground,

 sand snow-water, well-nigh finished him; not
 succoured sore extremity sage, great friend his,
 gone hard poor knight; may well suffer

 suffer suffer. have
 thee know, sancho, wounds caused instruments happen
 chance hand inflict indignity, laid in
 law duel express words: if, instance, cobbler
 strikes another last hand, though in
 fact piece wood, said reason he
 struck cudgelled. say lest thou shouldst
 imagine drubbed affray have
 therefore suffered indignity; arms men carried, with
 pounded us, nothing stakes, one
 them, far remember, carried rapier, sword, dagger.”
 
“they gave time see much,” answered sancho, “for hardly
 laid hand tizona signed cross shoulders
 sticks style took sight eyes
 strength feet, stretching now lie, and
 thinking whether stake-strokes indignity or
 gives uneasiness, pain blows does, they
 will remain deeply impressed memory shoulders.”
 
“for let tell thee, brother panza,” said don quixote, “that
 recollection time put end to, pain
 death remove.”
 
“and greater misfortune can be,” replied panza, “than the
 one waits time put end death remove it? if
 mishap one cured couple plasters,
 bad; beginning think the
 plasters hospital almost won’t enough put us right.”
 
“no that: pluck strength weakness, sancho, mean to
 do,” returned don quixote, “and let us see rocinante is, it
 seems least share mishap fallen the
 lot poor beast.”
 
“there nothing wonderful that,” replied sancho, “since a
 knight-errant too; wonder beast come
 scot-free come scotched.”
 
“fortune always leaves door open adversity order bring
 relief it,” said don quixote; “i say little beast
 may now supply want rocinante, carrying hence castle
 may cured wounds. moreover shall hold any
 dishonour mounted, remember read good old
 silenus, tutor instructor gay god laughter, he
 entered city hundred gates, went contentedly mounted on
 handsome ass.”
 
“it may true went mounted worship says,” answered
 sancho, “but great difference going mounted and
 going slung like sack manure.”
 
don quixote replied, “wounds received battle confer honour
 instead taking away; so, friend panza, say more, but, i
 told thee before, get well thou canst put top thy
 beast whatever fashion pleases thee best, let us go hence ere
 night come surprise us wilds.”
 
“and yet heard worship say,” observed panza, “that is
 meet knights-errant sleep wastes deserts, that
 esteem good fortune.”
 
“that is,” said don quixote, “when help it, they
 love; true knights have
 remained two years rocks, sunshine shade the

 make haste mishap like rocinante’s befalls ass.”
 
“the devil case,” said sancho; letting

“then must fallen too,” said hostess.

“that may well be,” said young girl, “for many time

“there point, señora,” replied sancho panza, “that without

“how gentleman called?” asked maritornes asturian.
 
“don quixote mancha,” answered sancho panza, “and a
 knight-adventurer, one best stoutest seen

“what knight-adventurer?” said lass.
 
“are new world know?” answered sancho panza.
 “well, then, must know, sister, knight-adventurer thing

 said, inns lodged castles eyes), and

 resolved heart commit treason lady dulcinea del
 toboso, even though queen guinevere dame quintañona

taken vagaries, then, time the
 hour—an unlucky one him—arrived asturian come, in
 smock, bare feet hair gathered fustian coif,
 noiseless cautious steps entered chamber three
 quartered, quest carrier; scarcely gained
 door don quixote perceived her, sitting bed in

 doubled silence hands feeling her
 lover, encountered arms don quixote, grasped tightly by
 wrist, drawing towards him, dared utter a
 word, made sit bed. felt smock, and
 although sackcloth appeared finest and
 softest silk: wrists wore glass beads, they
 sheen precious orient pearls: hair, some
 measure resembled horse’s mane, rated threads brightest
 gold araby, whose refulgence dimmed sun himself: breath,

 diffuse sweet aromatic fragrance mouth; and, short, he
 drew portrait imagination features the

 poor gentleman’s blindness neither touch, smell, anything

“would found myself, lovely exalted lady, position to

 impossible; besides, impossibility another yet
 greater added, faith pledged the
 peerless dulcinea toboso, sole lady secret thoughts; and
 stood way insensible a

maritornes fretting sweating finding held fast by
 don quixote, understanding heeding words addressed to

 lay stretched “in vale stakes,” began calling him
 now, “sancho, friend, art thou asleep? sleepest thou, friend
 sancho?”
 
“how can sleep, curses it!” returned sancho discontentedly and
 bitterly, “when plain devils this
 night?”
 
“thou mayest well believe that,” answered don quixote, “because, either
 know little, castle enchanted, thou must know—but this
 now tell thee thou must swear keep secret until
 death.”
 
“i swear it,” answered sancho.
 
“i say so,” continued don quixote, “because hate taking away anyone’s
 good name.”
 
“i say,” replied sancho, “that swear hold tongue till
 end worship’s days, god grant may able let it
 to-morrow.”
 
“do thee injuries, sancho,” said don quixote, “that thou
 wouldst see dead soon?”
 
“it that,” replied sancho, “but hate keeping
 things long, don’t want grow rotten from
 over-keeping.”
 
“at rate,” said don quixote, “i confidence thy

“not either,” said sancho, “for four hundred moors

 beauty spoke of; i, have, except heaviest whacks

“then thou hast thrashed too?” said don quixote.
 
“didn’t say so? worse luck line!” said sancho.
 
“be distressed, friend,” said don quixote, “for will now make the
 precious balsam shall cure twinkling of

“if don’t let seen, let felt,”
 said sancho; “if not, let shoulders speak point.”
 
“mine speak too,” said don quixote, “but sufficient
 reason believing see enchanted moor.”

 back unable move pure pummelling plasters. the
 officer turned said, “well, goes it, good man?”
 
“i speak politely you,” replied don quixote; “is

cuadrillero finding disrespectfully treated a
 sorry-looking individual, lost temper, raising lamp full of

 badly broken pate; then, darkness, went out, and
 sancho panza said, “that certainly enchanted moor, señor, he

“that truth,” answered don quixote, “and use in

sancho panza, also regarded amendment master as
 miraculous, begged give left pigskin, which
 small quantity. don quixote consented, he, taking with
 hands, good faith better will, gulped and
 drained little less master. fact is, the
 stomach poor sancho necessity delicate his
 master, so, vomiting, seized gripings and
 retchings, sweats faintness, verily truly he
 believed last hour come, finding racked and

don quixote seeing state said, “it belief, sancho,
 mischief comes thy dubbed knight, am

“if worship knew that,” returned sancho—“woe betide my

“then inn?” said don quixote.
 
“and respectable one,” said innkeeper.
 
“i mistake time,” answered don quixote, “for

 appears castle inn, can done now is

 anything else inn might be; hospitality that

 since knights-errant, since worship been
 one (for right reckon one honourable a
 number) never won battle except one biscayan,
 even worship came half ear half a
 helmet less; till now cudgellings and
 cudgellings, cuffs cuffs, getting blanketing over
 above, falling enchanted persons cannot
 avenge know delight, worship calls it,
 conquering enemy like.”
 
“that vexes me, vex thee, sancho,” replied
 don quixote; “but henceforward will endeavour hand some
 sword made craft kind enchantments can take effect
 upon carries it, even possible fortune may
 procure belonged amadis called ‘the
 knight burning sword,’ one best swords that
 ever knight world possessed, for, besides said
 virtue, cut like razor, armour, however strong
 enchanted might be, resist it.”
 
“such luck,” said sancho, “that even happened your
 worship found sword, would, like balsam, turn out
 serviceable good dubbed knights only, squires,
 might sup sorrow.”
 
“fear that, sancho,” said don quixote: “heaven will deal better by
 thee.”
 
thus talking, don quixote squire going along, when, the
 road following, don quixote perceived approaching a
 large thick cloud dust, seeing turned sancho and
 said:
 
“this day, sancho, will seen boon fortune is
 reserving me; this, say, day much any
 shall displayed might arm, shall do
 deeds shall remain written book fame ages to
 come. seest thou cloud dust rises yonder? well, then, all
 churned vast army composed various countless
 nations comes marching there.”
 
“according must two,” said sancho, “for this
 opposite side also rises just another cloud dust.”
 
don quixote turned look found true, rejoicing
 exceedingly, concluded two armies engage and
 encounter midst broad plain; times and
 seasons fancy full battles, enchantments, adventures,
 crazy feats, loves, defiances recorded books of
 chivalry, everything said, thought, reference such
 things. now cloud dust seen raised two great
 droves sheep coming along road opposite directions,
 which, dust, become visible drew
 near, don quixote asserted positively armies that
 sancho led believe say, “well, do,
 señor?”

“what?” said don quixote: “give aid assistance weak and
 need it; thou must know, sancho, comes
 opposite us conducted led mighty emperor alifanfaron,
 lord great isle trapobana; marches behind me
 enemy king garamantas, pentapolin bare
 arm, always goes battle right arm bare.”
 
“but two lords enemies?”
 
“they enmity,” replied don quixote, “because alifanfaron is
 furious pagan love daughter pentapolin, is
 beautiful moreover gracious lady, christian, her
 father unwilling bestow upon pagan king unless first
 abandons religion false prophet mahomet, adopts his
 own.”
 
“by beard,” said sancho, “but pentapolin quite right, i
 will help much can.”
 
“in thou wilt thy duty, sancho,” said don quixote; “for
 engage battles sort requisite dubbed
 knight.”
 
“that can well understand,” answered sancho; “but shall put
 ass may sure find fray over? i
 believe custom far go battle beast
 kind.”
 
“that true,” said don quixote, “and best is
 leave take chance whether lost not, the
 horses shall come victors will many even
 rocinante will run risk changed another. attend to
 observe, wish give thee account chief
 knights accompany two armies; thou mayest better
 see mark, let us withdraw hillock rises yonder,
 whence armies may seen.”
 
so, placed rising ground the
 two droves don quixote made armies might plainly seen
 clouds dust raised obscured blinded the
 sight; nevertheless, seeing imagination see and
 exist, began thus loud voice:
 
“that knight thou seest yonder yellow armour, bears upon
 shield lion crowned crouching feet damsel, the
 valiant laurcalco, lord silver bridge; one armour with
 flowers gold, bears shield three crowns argent an
 azure field, dreaded micocolembo, grand duke quirocia; that
 gigantic frame, right hand, ever dauntless
 brandabarbaran boliche, lord three arabias, armour
 wears serpent skin, shield gate which, according to
 tradition, one temple samson brought the

 baronies utrique; other, iron-shod heels strikes
 flanks nimble parti-coloured zebra, arms bears
 azure vair, mighty duke nerbia, espartafilardo bosque,
 bears device shield asparagus plant motto in
 castilian says, _‘rastrea suerte’_.” went naming a
 number knights one squadron imagination,
 assigned off-hand arms, colours, devices, and
 mottoes, carried away illusions unheard-of craze; and
 without pause, continued, “people divers nations compose this
 squadron front; drink sweet waters the
 famous xanthus, scour woody massilian plains, that
 sift pure fine gold arabia felix, enjoy famed
 cool banks crystal thermodon, many various
 ways divert streams golden pactolus, numidians,

good god! number countries nations named! giving to
 proper attributes marvellous readiness; brimful and
 saturated read lying books! sancho panza hung
 upon words without speaking, time time turned try if
 see knights giants master describing, as
 make one said him:
 
“señor, devil take there’s sign man talk of, knight
 giant, whole thing; maybe it’s enchantment, like the
 phantoms last night.”
 
“how canst thou say that!” answered don quixote; “dost thou hear
 neighing steeds, braying trumpets, roll of
 drums?”
 
“i hear nothing great bleating ewes sheep,” said sancho;
 true, time two flocks come close.
 
“the fear thou art in, sancho,” said don quixote, “prevents thee from
 seeing hearing correctly, one effects fear to
 derange senses make things appear different are;
 thou art fear, withdraw one side leave myself,
 alone suffice bring victory side shall give
 aid;” saying gave rocinante spur, putting the
 lance rest, shot slope like thunderbolt. sancho shouted
 him, crying, “come back, señor don quixote; vow god are
 sheep ewes charging! come back! unlucky father that
 begot me! madness this! look, giant, knight,
 cats, arms, shields quartered whole, vair azure or
 bedevilled. about? sinner god!” not
 entreaties don quixote turn back; contrary he
 went shouting out, “ho, knights, ye follow fight the
 banners valiant emperor pentapolin bare arm, follow me
 all; ye shall see easily shall give revenge his
 enemy alifanfaron trapobana.”
 
saying, dashed midst squadron ewes, began
 spearing much spirit intrepidity were
 transfixing mortal enemies earnest. shepherds drovers
 accompanying flock shouted desist; seeing use,
 ungirt slings began salute ears stones as
 big one’s fist. don quixote gave heed stones, but, letting
 drive right left kept saying:
 
“where art thou, proud alifanfaron? come me; single
 knight fain prove thy prowess hand hand, make thee
 yield thy life penalty wrong thou dost valiant
 pentapolin garamanta.” came sugar-plum brook that
 struck side buried couple ribs body. feeling
 smitten, imagined slain badly wounded for
 certain, recollecting liquor drew flask, putting
 mouth began pour contents stomach; ere he
 succeeded swallowing seemed enough, came
 another almond struck hand flask fairly
 smashed pieces, knocking three four teeth grinders
 mouth course, sorely crushing two fingers his
 hand. force first blow second, the
 poor knight spite came backwards horse. the
 shepherds came up, felt sure killed him; haste
 collected flock together, took dead beasts, which
 seven, made without waiting ascertain
 anything further.
 
time sancho stood hill watching crazy feats his
 master performing, tearing beard cursing hour and
 occasion fortune made acquainted him. seeing him,
 then, brought ground, shepherds taken
 off, ran found bad case, though
 unconscious; said he:
 
“did tell come back, señor don quixote; you
 going attack armies droves sheep?”
 
“that’s thief sage, enemy, can alter falsify
 things,” answered don quixote; “thou must know, sancho, a
 easy matter sort make us believe they
 choose; malignant persecutes me, envious the
 glory knew win battle, turned squadrons of
 enemy droves sheep. rate, much, beg of
 thee, sancho, undeceive thyself, see say true;
 mount thy ass follow quietly, thou shalt see when
 gone little distance will return their
 original shape and, ceasing sheep, become men respects as
 described thee first. go just yet, want thy
 help assistance; come hither, see many teeth and
 grinders missing, feel one left my
 mouth.”
 
sancho came close almost put eyes mouth; now
 just moment balsam acted stomach don quixote,
 so, instant sancho came examine mouth, he
 discharged contents force musket, full
 beard compassionate squire.
 
“holy mary!” cried sancho, “what happened me? clearly
 sinner mortally wounded, vomits blood mouth;”
 considering matter little closely perceived the
 colour, taste, smell, blood balsam the
 flask seen drink; taken a
 loathing stomach turned, vomited inside his
 master, left precious state. sancho ran his
 ass get something wherewith clean himself, relieve his
 master, alforjas; finding them, well-nigh took
 leave senses, cursed anew, heart resolved
 quit master return home, even though forfeited wages
 service hopes promised island.
 
don quixote now rose, putting left hand mouth keep
 teeth falling altogether, laid hold of
 bridle rocinante, never stirred master’s
 side—so loyal well-behaved he—and betook the
 squire stood leaning ass hand cheek, like one
 deep dejection. seeing mood, looking sad, don quixote
 said him:
 
“bear mind, sancho, one man another, unless he
 another; tempests fall upon us signs
 fair weather coming shortly, things will go well with
 us, impossible good evil last ever; hence
 follows evil lasted long, good must now nigh
 hand; thou must distress thyself misfortunes which
 happen me, since thou hast share them.”
 
“how not?” replied sancho; “was blanketed yesterday
 perchance father’s son? alforjas are
 missing to-day treasures, belong but
 myself?”
 
“what! alforjas missing, sancho?” said don quixote.
 
“yes, missing,” answered sancho.
 
“in case nothing eat to-day,” replied don quixote.
 
“it so,” answered sancho, “if none herbs
 worship says know meadows, which
 knights-errant unlucky worship wont supply such-like
 shortcomings.”
 
“for that,” answered don quixote, “i rather just now a
 quarter bread, loaf couple pilchards’ heads, all
 herbs described dioscorides, even doctor laguna’s notes.
 nevertheless, sancho good, mount thy beast come along me,
 god, provides things, will fail us (more especially
 active service are), since fails the
 midges air, grubs earth, tadpoles the
 water, merciful maketh sun rise good
 evil, sendeth rain unjust just.”
 
“your worship make better preacher knight-errant,” said
 sancho.
 
“knights-errant knew know everything, sancho,” said don
 quixote; “for knights-errant former times well
 qualified deliver sermon discourse middle an
 encampment, graduated university paris;
 whereby may see lance never blunted pen, the
 pen lance.”
 
“well, worship says,” replied sancho; “let us now
 find place shelter night, god grant may be
 somewhere blankets, blanketeers, phantoms,
 enchanted moors; are, may devil take whole
 concern.”
 
“ask god, son,” said don quixote; thou lead where
 thou wilt, time leave lodging thy choice; reach
 thy hand, feel thy finger, find many my
 teeth grinders missing right side upper jaw,
 feel pain.”
 
sancho put fingers, feeling asked him, “how many
 grinders used worship side?”
 
“four,” replied don quixote, “besides back-tooth, whole and
 quite sound.”
 
“mind saying, señor.”
 
“i say four, five,” answered don quixote, “for never life
 tooth grinder drawn, fallen been
 destroyed decay rheum.”
 
“well, then,” said sancho, “in lower side worship more
 two grinders half, upper neither half any
 all, smooth palm hand.”
 
“luckless am!” said don quixote, hearing sad news squire
 gave him; “i rather despoiled arm, the
 sword-arm; tell thee, sancho, mouth without teeth like a
 mill without millstone, tooth much prized a
 diamond; profess austere order chivalry liable to
 this. mount, friend, lead way, will follow thee at
 whatever pace thou wilt.”
 
sancho bade him, proceeded direction he
 thought might find refuge without quitting high road, was
 much frequented. went along, then, slow
 pace—for pain don quixote’s jaws kept uneasy and
 ill-disposed speed—sancho thought well amuse divert him
 talk kind, among things said that
 will told following chapter.

chapter xix.
 shrewd discourse sancho held master, the
 adventure befell dead body, together notable
 occurrences
 
“it seems me, señor, mishaps befallen us of
 late without doubt punishment offence committed
 worship order chivalry keeping oath
 made eat bread tablecloth embrace queen, and
 rest worship swore observe had
 taken helmet malandrino’s, whatever moor called, for
 well remember.”
 
“thou art right, sancho,” said don quixote, “but tell the
 truth, escaped memory; likewise thou mayest rely upon it
 affair blanket happened thee thy fault in
 reminding time; will make amends, are
 ways compounding everything order chivalry.”
 
“why! taken oath sort, then?” said sancho.
 
“it makes matter thou hast taken oath,” said don
 quixote; “suffice see thou art quite clear complicity;
 whether no, will ill done provide a
 remedy.”
 
“in case,” said sancho, “mind worship forget
 oath; perhaps phantoms may take their
 heads amuse me; even worship
 see obstinate.”
 
engaged talk, night overtook road
 reached discovered place shelter; what
 made still worse dying hunger, the
 loss alforjas lost entire larder and
 commissariat; complete misfortune met adventure
 without invention really appearance one. so
 happened night closed somewhat darkly, that
 pushed on, sancho feeling sure road king’s
 highway might reasonably expect find inn within league
 two. going along, then, way, night dark, squire
 hungry, master sharp-set, saw coming towards road
 travelling great number lights looked exactly like
 stars motion. sancho taken aback sight them, did
 don quixote altogether relish them: one pulled ass the
 halter, hack bridle, stood still,
 watching anxiously see turn be, found
 lights approaching them, nearer came the
 greater seemed, spectacle sancho began shake like a
 man dosed mercury, don quixote’s hair stood end; he,
 however, plucking spirit little, said:
 
“this, doubt, sancho, will mighty perilous adventure,
 will needful put forth valour and
 resolution.”
 
“unlucky me!” answered sancho; “if adventure happens one of
 phantoms, beginning think is, shall find ribs
 bear it?”
 
“be phantoms ever much,” said don quixote, “i will permit
 touch thread thy garments; played tricks with
 thee time before, unable leap walls of
 yard; now wide plain, shall able to
 wield sword please.”
 
“and enchant cripple last time,” said
 sancho, “what difference will make open plain not?”
 
“for that,” replied don quixote, “i entreat thee, sancho, keep a
 good heart, experience will tell thee mine is.”
 
“i will, please god,” answered sancho, two retiring one side
 road set observe closely moving
 lights might be; soon afterwards made twenty
 encamisados, horseback, lighted torches hands, the
 awe-inspiring aspect completely extinguished courage of
 sancho, began chatter teeth like one cold fit of
 ague; heart sank teeth chattered still when
 perceived distinctly behind came litter covered
 black followed six mounted figures mourning
 feet mules—for perceive plainly
 horses easy pace went. the
 encamisados came along muttered low plaintive
 tone. strange spectacle hour solitary
 place quite enough strike terror sancho’s heart, even
 master’s; (save don quixote’s case) so, all
 sancho’s resolution now broken down. just opposite with
 master, whose imagination immediately conjured him
 vividly one adventures books.
 
took head litter bier borne
 sorely wounded slain knight, avenge task reserved
 alone; without reasoning laid lance in
 rest, fixed firmly saddle, gallant spirit and
 bearing took position middle road the
 encamisados must necessity pass; soon saw near at
 hand raised voice said:
 
“halt, knights, whosoever ye may be, render account ye
 are, whence ye come, ye go, ye carry upon bier,
 for, judge appearances, either ye done wrong some
 wrong done you, fitting necessary i
 know, either may chastise evil ye done,
 else may avenge injury inflicted
 upon you.”
 
“we haste,” answered one encamisados, “and inn far
 off, stop render account demand;”
 spurring mule moved on.
 
don quixote mightily provoked answer, seizing mule
 bridle said, “halt, mannerly, render an
 account asked you; else, take defiance combat,
 you.”
 
mule shy, frightened bridle seized that
 rearing flung rider ground haunches. an
 attendant foot, seeing encamisado fall, began abuse
 don quixote, now moved anger, without ado, laying his
 lance rest charged one men mourning brought badly
 wounded ground, wheeled round upon others the
 agility attacked routed sight see, for
 seemed just wings instant grown upon rocinante, so
 lightly proudly bear himself. encamisados timid
 folk unarmed, speedily made escape fray and
 set run across plain lighted torches, looking
 exactly like maskers running gala festival night. the
 mourners, too, enveloped swathed skirts gowns, were
 unable bestir themselves, entire safety don
 quixote belaboured drove will, for
 thought man devil hell come carry away
 dead body litter.
 
sancho beheld astonishment intrepidity lord,
 said himself, “clearly master mine bold and
 valiant says is.”
 
burning torch lay ground near first man mule had
 thrown, light don quixote perceived him, coming up
 presented point lance face, calling him
 yield prisoner, else kill him; the
 prostrate man replied, “i prisoner enough is; stir,
 one legs broken: entreat you, christian
 gentleman, kill me, will committing grave sacrilege,
 licentiate hold first orders.”
 
“then devil brought here, churchman?” said don
 quixote.
 
“what, señor?” said other. “my bad luck.”
 
“then still worse awaits you,” said don quixote, “if satisfy
 asked first.”
 
“you shall soon satisfied,” said licentiate; “you must know,
 then, though just now said licentiate, a
 bachelor, name alonzo lopez; native alcobendas, i
 come city baeza eleven others, priests, who
 fled torches, going city segovia
 accompanying dead body litter, a
 gentleman died baeza, interred; now, said,
 taking bones burial-place, segovia,
 born.”
 
“and killed him?” asked don quixote.
 
“god, means malignant fever took him,” answered the
 bachelor.
 
“in case,” said don quixote, “the lord relieved task
 avenging death slain him; but, slew him
 slain him, nothing silent, shrug
 one’s shoulders; slay myself; i
 reverence know knight mancha, don
 quixote name, business calling roam world
 righting wrongs redressing injuries.”
 
“i know righting wrongs can be,” said the
 bachelor, “for straight made crooked, leaving with
 broken leg will never see straight days of
 life; injury redressed case to
 leave injured way shall remain injured ever;
 height misadventure fall go in
 search adventures.”
 
“things happen way,” answered don quixote; “it
 came, sir bachelor alonzo lopez, going, did, by
 night, dressed surplices, lighted torches, praying,
 covered mourning, naturally looked like something evil
 world; avoid duty in
 attacking you, attacked even known
 positively devils hell, certainly
 believed took be.”
 
“as fate willed it,” said bachelor, “i entreat you, sir
 knight-errant, whose errand evil one me, help
 get mule holds one legs caught between
 stirrup saddle.”
 
“i talked till to-morrow,” said don quixote; “how long
 going wait telling distress?”
 
called sancho, who, however, mind come, he
 just engaged unloading sumpter mule, well laden with
 provender, worthy gentlemen brought them. sancho
 made bag coat, and, getting together much could, and
 bag hold, loaded beast, hastened obey
 master’s call, helped remove bachelor the
 mule; putting back gave torch, don
 quixote bade follow track companions, beg pardon of
 part wrong help them.
 
said sancho, “if chance gentlemen want know who
 hero served so, worship may tell is
 famous don quixote mancha, otherwise called knight the
 rueful countenance.”
 
bachelor took departure.
 
forgot mention said don quixote,
 “remember stand excommunicated laid violent hands
 holy thing, _juxta illud, quis, suadente diabolo_.”
 
“i understand latin,” answered don quixote, “but know
 well lay hands, pike; besides, think i
 committing assault upon priests things church, which,
 like catholic faithful christian am, respect revere,
 upon phantoms spectres world; even so, i
 remember fared cid ruy diaz broke chair the
 ambassador king holiness pope, who
 excommunicated same; yet good roderick vivar
 bore day like noble valiant knight.”
 
hearing bachelor took departure, said,
 without making reply; don quixote asked sancho induced
 call “knight rueful countenance” than
 time.
 
“i will tell you,” answered sancho; “it looking
 time light torch held that
 unfortunate, verily worship got late most
 ill-favoured countenance ever saw: must either owing the
 fatigue combat, else want teeth grinders.”
 
“it that,” replied don quixote, “but sage whose duty
 will write history achievements must thought it
 proper take distinctive name knights yore
 did; one ‘he burning sword,’ another ‘he unicorn,’
 one ‘he damsels,’ ‘he phœnix,’ another ‘the
 knight griffin,’ another ‘he death,’ these
 names designations known world round; i
 say sage aforesaid must put mouth mind
 just now call ‘the knight rueful countenance,’ intend
 call day forward; said name may fit me
 better, mean, opportunity offers, rueful
 countenance painted shield.”
 
“there occasion, señor, wasting time money making that
 countenance,” said sancho; “for need done your
 worship show own, face face, look you, and
 without anything more, either image shield, will call ‘him
 rueful countenance’ believe telling truth,
 assure you, señor (and good part said), hunger the
 loss grinders given ill-favoured face that, as
 say, rueful picture may well spared.”
 
don quixote laughed sancho’s pleasantry; nevertheless resolved to
 call name, shield buckler painted he
 devised.
 
don quixote looked see whether body litter
 bones not, sancho it, saying:
 
“señor, ended perilous adventure safely yourself
 seen: perhaps people, though beaten and
 routed, may bethink single man beaten
 them, feeling sore ashamed may take heart come in
 search us give us trouble enough. ass proper trim, the
 mountains near hand, hunger presses, nothing do
 make good retreat, and, saying is, dead grave
 living loaf.”
 
driving ass begged master follow, who,
 feeling sancho right, without replying; after
 proceeding little distance two hills found themselves
 wide retired valley, alighted, sancho unloaded
 beast, stretched upon green grass, hunger sauce,
 breakfasted, dined, lunched, supped once, satisfying
 appetites one store cold meat dead
 man’s clerical gentlemen (who seldom put short allowance)
 brought sumpter mule. another piece of
 ill-luck befell them, sancho held worst all, was
 wine drink, even water moisten lips;
 thirst tormented them, sancho, observing meadow where
 full green tender grass, said will told in
 following chapter.

“it be, señor, grass proof must be

 move little farther on, may find place may
 quench terrible thirst plagues us, beyond doubt is
 distressing hunger.”
 
advice seemed good don quixote, and, leading rocinante the
 bridle sancho ass halter, packed away upon
 remains supper, advanced meadow feeling their
 way, darkness night made impossible see anything;
 gone two hundred paces loud noise water, as
 falling great rocks, struck ears. sound cheered them
 greatly; halting make listening quarter came
 heard unseasonably another noise spoiled satisfaction
 sound water gave them, especially sancho, by
 nature timid faint-hearted. heard, say, strokes falling with
 measured beat, certain rattling iron chains that,
 together furious din water, struck terror
 heart don quixote’s. night was, said,
 dark, happened reach spot among tall trees,
 whose leaves stirred gentle breeze made low ominous sound; so
 that, solitude, place, darkness, noise the
 water, rustling leaves, everything inspired awe and
 dread; especially perceived strokes not
 cease, wind lull, morning approach; might be
 added ignorance were.

don quixote, supported intrepid heart, leaped rocinante,
 bracing buckler arm, brought pike slope, and
 said, “friend sancho, know heaven’s will born in
 iron age revive age gold, golden it
 called; perils, mighty achievements, valiant
 deeds reserved; am, say again, revive knights
 round table, twelve france nine worthies; he
 consign oblivion platirs, tablantes, olivantes
 tirantes, phœbuses belianises, whole herd of
 famous knights-errant days gone by, performing i
 live exploits, marvels, feats arms shall obscure their
 brightest deeds. thou dost mark well, faithful trusty squire, the
 gloom night, strange silence, dull confused murmur of
 trees, awful sound water quest came,
 seems though precipitating dashing from
 lofty mountains moon, incessant hammering that
 wounds pains ears; things together itself
 enough instil fear, dread, dismay breast mars
 himself, much one used hazards adventures the
 kind. well, then, put thee incentive
 stimulant spirit, making heart burst bosom through
 eagerness engage adventure, arduous promises be;
 therefore tighten rocinante’s girths little, god thee;
 wait three days more, time come not
 back, thou canst return village, thence, favour
 service, thou wilt go toboso, thou shalt say my
 incomparable lady dulcinea captive knight hath died in
 attempting things might make worthy called hers.”
 
sancho heard master’s words began weep most
 pathetic way, saying:
 
“señor, know worship wants attempt dreadful
 adventure; night now, one sees us here, can easily turn
 take danger, even don’t drink for
 three days come; one see us, less will
 anyone set us cowards; besides, many time
 heard curate village, worship knows well, preach

 covetousness bursts bag, rent hopes asunder, just as
 highest getting wretched unlucky island your
 worship often promised me, see instead lieu it
 mean desert now place far human reach: god’s
 sake, master mine, deal unjustly me, worship will
 entirely give attempting feat, least put till
 morning, lore learned shepherd tells me
 want three hours dawn now, mouth horn
 overhead makes midnight line left arm.”
 
“how canst thou see, sancho,” said don quixote, “where makes that
 line, mouth occiput thou talkest of, when
 night dark star seen whole
 heaven?”
 
“that’s true,” said sancho, “but fear sharp eyes, sees things
 underground, much heavens; besides, good reason
 show now wants little day.”
 
“let want may,” replied don quixote, “it shall said
 now time tears entreaties turned aside from
 accordance knightly usage; beg thee,
 sancho, hold thy peace, god, put heart to
 undertake now unexampled terrible adventure, will take care
 watch safety console thy sorrow; thou hast is
 tighten rocinante’s girths well, wait here, shall come
 back shortly, alive dead.”
 
sancho perceiving master’s final resolve, little his
 tears, counsels, entreaties prevailed him, determined have
 recourse ingenuity compel him, could, wait till
 daylight; so, tightening girths horse, quietly
 without felt, ass’ halter tied rocinante’s
 legs, don quixote strove go unable horse
 move jumps. seeing success trick, sancho panza
 said:
 
“see there, señor! heaven, moved tears prayers, so
 ordered rocinante stir; will obstinate,
 spur strike him, will provoke fortune, kick, as
 say, pricks.”
 
don quixote grew desperate, drove heels
 horse, less stirred him; suspicion
 tying, fain resign wait till daybreak or
 rocinante move, firmly persuaded came of
 something sancho’s ingenuity. said him, “as is
 so, sancho, rocinante move, content wait till
 dawn smiles upon us, even though weep delays coming.”
 
“there need weep,” answered sancho, “for will amuse your
 worship telling stories till daylight, unless indeed you
 like dismount lie sleep little green grass
 fashion knights-errant, fresher day comes
 moment arrives attempting extraordinary adventure you
 looking forward to.”
 
“what art thou talking dismounting sleeping for?” said don
 quixote. “am i, thinkest thou, one knights take their

 thou wilt, will act think consistent my
 character.”
 
“be angry, master mine,” replied sancho, “i mean say
 that;” coming close laid one hand pommel the
 saddle cantle held master’s left
 thigh embrace, daring separate finger’s width him;
 much afraid strokes still resounded a
 regular beat. don quixote bade tell story amuse he
 proposed, sancho replied dread of
 heard let him; “still,” said he, “i will strive tell a
 story which, can manage relate it, nobody interferes with
 telling, best stories, let worship give your
 attention, begin. was, was; may good to

“go thy story, sancho,” said don quixote, “and leave choice

“i say then,” continued sancho, “that village estremadura there

“if way thou tellest thy tale, sancho,” said don quixote,
 “repeating twice thou hast say, thou wilt done these

“tales always told country way telling

“that natural way women,” said don quixote, “to scorn one

“take granted brought across,” said don quixote,
 “and don’t keep going coming way, thou wilt make an

“how many gone across far?” said sancho.
 
“how devil know?” replied don quixote.
 
“there is,” said sancho, “what told you, must keep good

“how can be?” said don quixote; “is essential story

“so, then,” said don quixote, “the story come end?”
 
“as much mother has,” said sancho.
 
“in truth,” said don quixote, “thou hast told one rarest

 unlucky enough make little noise, different

don quixote, hearing it, said, “what noise that, sancho?”
 
“i don’t know, señor,” said he; “it must something new, for
 adventures misadventures never begin trifle.” he
 tried luck, succeeded well, without noise
 disturbance found relieved burden given
 much discomfort. don quixote’s sense smell as
 acute hearing, sancho closely linked that
 fumes rose almost straight line, some
 reach nose, soon came relief by
 compressing fingers, saying rather snuffing tone,
 “sancho, strikes thou art great fear.”
 
“i am,” answered sancho; “but worship perceive now
 ever?”
 
“because just now thou smellest stronger ever, of
 ambergris,” answered don quixote.
 
“very likely,” said sancho, “but that’s fault, your
 worship’s, leading unseasonable hours such
 unwonted paces.”
 
“then go back three four, friend,” said don quixote, time
 fingers nose; “and future pay attention to
 thy person thou owest mine; great
 familiarity thee bred contempt.”
 
“i’ll bet,” replied sancho, “that worship thinks done
 something person.”
 
“it makes worse stir it, friend sancho,” returned don quixote.
 
talk sort master man passed the
 night, till sancho, perceiving daybreak coming apace, very
 cautiously untied rocinante tied breeches. soon as
 rocinante found free, though nature all
 mettlesome, seemed feel lively began pawing—for to
 capering, begging pardon, knew meant. don quixote,
 then, observing rocinante move, took good sign a
 signal attempt dread adventure. time day had
 fully broken everything showed distinctly, don quixote saw that
 among tall trees, chestnuts, cast deep shade;
 perceived likewise sound strokes cease, but
 discover caused it, without delay he
 let rocinante feel spur, taking leave sancho, he
 told wait three days most, said

 sure god’s will end days that
 perilous adventure. repeated message commission with
 go behalf lady dulcinea, said was
 uneasy payment services, leaving
 home made will, find fully
 recompensed matter wages due proportion time had

 danger, might look upon promised island much than

 words good master, resolved stay final
 issue end business. tears honourable
 resolve sancho panza’s author history infers he
 must good birth least old christian; the
 feeling displayed touched much make show
 weakness; contrary, hiding felt well could,
 began move towards quarter whence sound water and
 strokes seemed come.
 
sancho followed foot, leading halter, custom was,
 ass, constant comrade prosperity adversity; advancing
 distance shady chestnut trees came upon little
 meadow foot high rocks, mighty rush of
 water flung itself. foot rocks rudely
 constructed houses looking like ruins houses, among
 came, perceived, din clatter blows, still
 continued without intermission. rocinante took fright noise of
 water blows, quieting don quixote advanced step
 step towards houses, commending heart to
 lady, imploring support dread pass enterprise, and
 way commending god, too, forget him. sancho
 never quitted side, stretched neck far and
 peered legs rocinante see now discover
 caused fear apprehension. went it
 might hundred paces farther, turning corner true
 cause, beyond possibility mistake, dread-sounding
 awe-inspiring noise kept night in
 fear perplexity, appeared plain obvious; (if,
 reader, thou art disgusted disappointed) six fulling hammers
 alternate strokes made din.
 
don quixote perceived was, struck dumb rigid
 head foot. sancho glanced saw head bent
 upon breast manifest mortification; don quixote glanced
 sancho saw cheeks puffed mouth full of
 laughter, evidently ready explode it, spite his
 vexation help laughing sight him; when
 sancho saw master begin let go heartily hold
 sides hands keep bursting laughter.
 four times stopped, many times laughter break out
 afresh violence first, whereat don quixote grew
 furious, heard say mockingly, “thou must know,
 friend sancho, heaven’s will born iron age to
 revive golden age gold; reserved
 perils, mighty achievements, valiant deeds;” went on
 repeating words don quixote uttered first time heard
 awful strokes.
 
don quixote, then, seeing sancho turning ridicule,
 mortified vexed lifted pike smote two
 blows if, instead catching shoulders, had
 caught head wages pay, unless
 indeed heirs. sancho seeing getting awkward
 return earnest jest, fearing master might carry it
 still further, said humbly, “calm yourself, sir, god
 joking.”
 
“well, then, joking not,” replied don quixote. “look
 here, lively gentleman, these, instead fulling hammers,
 perilous adventure, not, think you, shown the
 courage required attempt achievement? i, perchance,
 being, am, gentleman, bound know distinguish sounds and
 tell whether come fulling mills not; that, when
 perhaps, case, never life seen have,
 low boor are, born bred among them? turn
 six hammers six giants, bring beard me, one
 one together, knock head heels,
 make mockery like me.”
 
“no that, señor,” returned sancho; “i went little too
 far joke. tell me, worship, now peace made
 us (and may god bring adventures may
 befall safe sound brought one),
 thing laugh at, good story, great
 fear in?—at least in; worship see
 now neither know understand either fear dismay
 is.”
 
“i deny,” said don quixote, “that happened us may be
 worth laughing at, worth making story about, is
 everyone shrewd enough hit right point thing.”
 
“at rate,” said sancho, “your worship knew hit right
 point pike, aiming head hitting the
 shoulders, thanks god smartness dodging it. let
 pass; will come scouring; heard say ‘he
 loves thee well makes thee weep;’ moreover way
 great lords hard words give servant give a
 pair breeches; though know give blows,
 unless knights-errant blows give islands, kingdoms
 mainland.”
 
“it may dice,” said don quixote, “that thou sayest will
 come true; overlook past, thou art shrewd enough know that
 first movements control; one thing the
 future bear mind, thou curb restrain thy loquacity my
 company; books chivalry read, they
 innumerable, never met squire talked much his

 thou wilt gather, sancho, must difference between
 master man, lord lackey, knight squire: so
 day forward intercourse must observe more
 respect take less liberties, whatever way may provoked
 will bad pitcher. favours benefits that
 promised will come due time, your
 wages least will lost, already told you.”
 
“all worship says well,” said sancho, “but should
 like know (in case time favours come, might
 necessary fall back upon wages) much squire a
 knight-errant get days, agree month, by
 day like bricklayers?”
 
“i believe,” replied don quixote, “that squires ever

 thine sealed will left home, view to

 wretched times ours, wish soul suffer for
 trifles world; thee know, sancho, in
 condition hazardous adventurers.”
 
“that true,” said sancho, “since mere noise hammers a
 fulling mill can disturb disquiet heart valiant
 errant adventurer worship; may sure will open
 lips henceforward make light anything worship’s, but
 honour master natural lord.”
 
“by doing,” replied don quixote, “shalt thou live long face

now began rain little, sancho going the
 fulling mills, don quixote taken abhorrence on
 account late joke enter account;
 turning aside right came upon another road, different from
 taken night before. shortly afterwards don
 quixote perceived man horseback wore head something
 shone like gold, moment saw turned sancho and
 said:
 
“i think, sancho, proverb true, being
 maxims drawn experience itself, mother sciences,
 especially one says, ‘where one door shuts, another opens.’ i
 say last night fortune shut door adventure we
 looking us, cheating us fulling mills, now
 opens wide another one another better certain adventure,
 contrive enter it, will fault, i
 lay ignorance fulling mills, darkness the
 night. say because, mistake not, comes towards us one
 wears head helmet mambrino, concerning took
 oath thou rememberest.”
 
“mind say, worship, still do,” said
 sancho, “for don’t want fulling mills finish fulling
 knocking senses out.”
 
“the devil take thee, man,” said don quixote; “what helmet do
 fulling mills?”
 
“i don’t know,” replied sancho, “but, faith, might speak i
 used, perhaps give reasons worship see you
 mistaken say.”
 
“how can mistaken say, unbelieving traitor?” returned
 don quixote; “tell me, seest thou yonder knight coming towards us
 dappled grey steed, upon head helmet gold?”
 
“what see make out,” answered sancho, “is man grey
 ass like own, something shines head.”
 
“well, helmet mambrino,” said don quixote; “stand one
 side leave alone him; thou shalt see how, without saying a
 word, save time, shall bring adventure issue and
 possess helmet longed for.”
 
“i will take care stand aside,” said sancho; “but god grant, say
 more, may marjoram fulling mills.”
 
“i told thee, brother, account mention fulling
 mills again,” said don quixote, “or vow—and say more—i’ll
 full soul you.”
 
sancho held peace dread lest master carry vow
 hurled like bowl him.
 
fact matter regards helmet, steed, knight that
 don quixote saw, this. neighbourhood two
 villages, one small neither apothecary’s shop
 barber, close had, barber of
 larger served smaller, sick man who
 required bled another man wanted shaved, on
 errand barber going, carrying brass basin; but
 luck it, way began rain, not
 spoil hat, probably new one, put basin his
 head, clean glittered half league’s distance. rode
 upon grey ass, sancho said, made seem don
 quixote dapple-grey steed knight golden helmet; for
 everything saw made fall crazy chivalry and
 ill-errant notions; saw poor knight draw near, without
 entering parley him, rocinante’s top speed bore
 upon pike pointed low, fully determined run him
 through, reached him, without checking fury
 charge, cried him:
 
“defend thyself, miserable being, yield thine accord that
 reasonably due.”
 
barber, without expectation apprehension saw this
 apparition coming upon him, way saving himself
 stroke lance let fall ass; and
 sooner touched ground sprang nimbly than
 deer sped away across plain faster wind.
 
left basin ground, don quixote contented
 himself, saying pagan shown discretion imitated
 beaver, finding pressed hunters bites cuts
 teeth which, natural instinct, knows it
 pursued.
 
told sancho pick helmet, taking hands
 said:
 
“by god basin good one, worth real eight is
 worth maravedis,” handed master, immediately put it
 head, turning round, now way, now that, search of
 fitment, finding said, “clearly pagan whose
 measure famous head-piece first forged must very
 large head; worst half wanting.”
 
sancho heard call basin headpiece unable to
 restrain laughter, remembering master’s wrath checked
 midst it.
 
“what art thou laughing at, sancho?” said don quixote.
 
“i laughing,” said he, “to think great head pagan must
 owned helmet, looks exactly like regular
 barber’s basin.”
 
“dost thou know suspect, sancho?” said don quixote; “that this
 wonderful piece enchanted helmet must strange accident
 come hands someone unable recognise or
 realise value, who, knowing did, seeing to
 purest gold, must melted one half sake of
 might worth, made like a

 will quite enough protect chance blow a

“that is,” said sancho, “if shot sling in
 battle two armies, signed cross your
 worship’s grinders smashed flask blessed draught that
 made vomit bowels up.”
 
“it grieve much lost it,” said don quixote, “for
 thou knowest, sancho, receipt memory.”
 
“so i,” answered sancho, “but ever make it, try again
 long live, may last hour; moreover, no
 intention putting way wanting it, mean, with
 five senses, keep wounded wounding
 anyone: blanketed say nothing, hard to
 prevent mishaps sort, come nothing it
 squeeze shoulders together, hold breath, shut eyes,
 let go luck blanket may send us.”
 
“thou art bad christian, sancho,” said don quixote hearing this,
 “for injury done thee thou never forgettest it: but
 know part noble generous hearts attach
 importance trifles. lame leg hast thou got it, broken
 rib, cracked head, thou canst forget jest? jest
 sport was, properly regarded, seen that

 aloft; said sancho, “let pass jest be
 revenged earnest, know sort jest earnest was,
 know will never rubbed memory off
 shoulders. putting aside, will worship tell what
 dapple-grey steed looks like grey ass,
 martino worship overthrew left deserted here?
 for, way took heels bolted, likely
 ever come back it; beard grey good one.”
 
“i never habit,” said don quixote, “of taking spoil of
 vanquish, practice chivalry take away
 horses leave go foot, unless indeed the
 victor lost combat, case lawful to
 take vanquished thing won lawful war; therefore,
 sancho, leave horse, ass, whatever thou wilt be;
 owner sees us gone hence will come back it.”
 
“god knows like take it,” returned sancho, “or least to
 change own, seem good one: verily
 laws chivalry strict, since stretched let
 one ass changed another; like know might at
 least change trappings.”
 
“on head quite certain,” answered don quixote, “and the
 matter doubtful, pending better information, say thou mayest
 change them, thou hast urgent need them.”
 
“so urgent it,” answered sancho, “that own
 person want more;” forthwith, fortified this
 licence, effected _mutatio capparum_, rigged beast
 ninety-nines making quite another thing it. done,
 broke fast remains spoils war plundered
 sumpter mule, drank brook flowed the
 fulling mills, without casting look direction, such
 loathing hold alarm caused them; and,
 anger gloom removed, mounted and, without taking fixed
 road (not fix upon proper thing true
 knights-errant), set out, guided rocinante’s will, which
 carried along master, say ass,
 always followed wherever led, lovingly sociably;
 nevertheless returned high road, pursued a
 venture without aim.
 
went along, then, way sancho said master,
 “señor, worship give leave speak little you? for
 since laid hard injunction silence several things
 gone rot stomach, now just one tip of
 tongue don’t want spoiled.”
 
“say, on, sancho,” said don quixote, “and brief thy discourse,

“well then, señor,” returned sancho, “i say days past i

 though make bold say that, practice chivalry to

“thou speakest amiss, sancho,” answered don quixote, “but before

“that’s want, mistake it!” said sancho. “that’s
 i’m waiting for; this, word word, store your
 worship title knight rueful countenance.”
 
“thou needst doubt it, sancho,” replied don quixote, “for the
 manner, steps described here,
 knights-errant rise risen kings emperors; we
 want now find king, christian pagan, war and
 beautiful daughter; will time enough think of
 that, for, told thee, fame must won quarters
 repairing court. another thing, too, is
 wanting; supposing find king war beautiful
 daughter, won incredible fame throughout universe,

 daughter marriage unless first thoroughly satisfied on

 deficiency fear shall lose arm fairly earned. true

 difference one longer are,

 investigation origin may prove great famous, with
 king, father-in-law be, satisfied;
 be, princess will love even though she
 well knew water-carrier, will take her
 lord husband spite father; not, comes to
 seizing carrying please; time death will
 put end wrath parents.”
 
“it comes this, too,” said sancho, “what naughty people say,
 ‘never ask favour thou canst take force;’ though would
 fit better say, ‘a clear escape better good men’s prayers.’
 say lord king, worship’s father-in-law,
 will condescend give lady princess, nothing
 but, worship says, seize transport her. but
 mischief peace made come peaceful
 enjoyment kingdom, poor squire famishing far as
 rewards go, unless confidante damsel his
 wife comes princess, tides bad
 luck heaven otherwise orders things; master, suppose,
 may well give lawful wife.”
 
“nobody can object that,” said don quixote.
 
“then since may be,” said sancho, “there nothing to
 commend god, let fortune take course will.”
 
“god guide according wishes thy wants,” said don quixote,
 “and mean thinks mean.”
 
“in god’s name let so,” said sancho: “i old christian, and
 fit count that’s enough.”
 
“and enough thee,” said don quixote; “and even wert thou
 not, make difference, king can easily
 give thee nobility without purchase service rendered thee, for
 make thee count, thou art gentleman; they
 may say will, faith will call thee
 ‘your lordship,’ whether like not.”
 
“not doubt it; i’ll know support tittle,” said
 sancho.
 
“title thou shouldst say, tittle,” said master.
 
“so it,” answered sancho. “i say will know behave, once
 life beadle brotherhood, beadle’s gown sat so
 well said looked steward same
 brotherhood. will be, then, put duke’s robe my
 back, dress gold pearls like count? believe
 they’ll come hundred leagues see me.”
 
“thou wilt look well,” said don quixote, “but thou must shave thy beard
 often, thou hast thick rough unkempt, thou
 dost shave every second day least, will see thou
 art distance musket shot.”
 
“what will be,” said sancho, “than barber, keeping
 wages house? even necessary, will make him
 go behind like nobleman’s equerry.”
 
“why, dost thou know noblemen equerries behind them?”
 asked don quixote.
 
“i will tell you,” answered sancho. “years ago month the
 capital saw taking air small gentleman they
 said great man, man following horseback in
 every turn took, just tail. asked man
 join man, instead always going behind him; they
 answered equerry, custom with
 nobles persons behind them, ever since know it,
 never forgotten it.”
 
“thou art right,” said don quixote, “and way thou mayest
 carry thy barber thee, customs come use all
 together, invented once, thou mayest the
 first count barber follow him; and, indeed, shaving one’s
 beard greater trust saddling one’s horse.”
 
“let barber business look-out,” said sancho; “and your
 worship’s strive become king, make count.”
 
“so shall be,” answered don quixote, raising eyes saw

“what gurapas?” asked don quixote.
 
“gurapas galleys,” answered galley slave, young man
 four-and-twenty, said native piedrahita.
 
don quixote asked question second, made reply,
 downcast melancholy he; first answered him, and
 said, “he, sir, goes canary, mean musician singer.”

“on contrary, heard say,” said don quixote, “that who
 sings scares away woes.”
 
“here reverse,” said galley slave; “for sings once

 levelling another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every one

 hiding sierra close by.
 
“that well,” said don quixote, “but know must be

gines pasamonte made answer all, saying, “that you, sir,

 begged book chivalry read, one fond of,

don quixote sooner heard book chivalry mentioned, said:
 
“had worship told beginning story lady
 luscinda fond books chivalry, laudation have
 requisite impress upon superiority understanding,
 excellence describe taste
 delightful reading wanting; so, far concerned,
 need waste words describing beauty, worth, and
 intelligence; for, merely hearing taste was, declare her
 beautiful intelligent woman world;
 wish worship had, along amadis gaul, sent the
 worthy don rugel greece, know lady luscinda greatly
 relish daraida garaya, shrewd sayings shepherd
 darinel, admirable verses bucolics, sung delivered
 sprightliness, wit, ease; time may come when
 omission can remedied, rectify nothing needed

 wicked envious enchanters;—but pardon broken the
 promise made interrupt discourse; hear
 chivalry knights-errant mentioned, can help talking about
 rays sun can help giving heat, the
 moon moisture; pardon me, therefore, proceed, to
 purpose now.”
 
don quixote saying this, cardenio allowed head fall
 upon breast, seemed plunged deep thought; though twice
 don quixote bade go story, neither looked nor
 uttered word reply; time raised head and
 said, “i get rid idea, will anyone world
 remove it, make think otherwise—and blockhead who
 hold believe anything else arrant knave master
 elisabad made free queen madasima.”
 
“that true, that’s good,” said don quixote high wrath,
 turning upon angrily, way was; “and great
 slander, rather villainy. queen madasima illustrious

 like great scoundrel, will give know it, foot on
 horseback, armed unarmed, night day, likes best.”
 
cardenio looking steadily, mad fit now come
 upon him, disposition go story, don
 quixote listened it, much heard about
 madasima disgusted him. strange say, stood she
 earnest veritable born lady; pass unholy
 books brought him. cardenio, then, being, said, now mad, he
 heard given lie, called scoundrel insulting
 names, relishing jest, snatched stone found near

 laid back. sancho panza, seeing master treated this
 fashion, attacked madman closed fist; ragged one

“leave alone, sir knight rueful countenance,” said sancho,
 grappling goatherd, “for fellow, clown like

 affront offered me, fighting hand hand like an

“that true,” said don quixote, “but know blame

don quixote took leave goatherd, mounting
 rocinante bade sancho follow him, ass, very
 discontentedly. proceeded slowly, making way most
 rugged part mountain, sancho dying talk
 master, longing begin, be
 breach injunction laid upon him; unable keep silence
 long said him:
 
“señor don quixote, give worship’s blessing dismissal, for
 i’d like go home wife children can at
 rate talk converse much like; want go
 solitudes day night speak have
 mind burying alive. luck animals spoke as
 days guisopete, bad, i
 talk rocinante whatever came head, put up
 ill-fortune; hard case, borne with
 patience, go seeking adventures one’s life get nothing but
 kicks blanketings, brickbats punches, have
 sew one’s mouth without daring say one’s heart,
 just one dumb.”
 
“i understand thee, sancho,” replied don quixote; “thou art dying to
 interdict placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it
 removed, say thou wilt wandering these
 mountains.”
 
“so it,” said sancho; “let speak now, god knows will
 happen by-and-by; take advantage permit once, ask,
 made worship stand queen majimasa, whatever
 name is, matter whether abbot friend of
 not? worship let pass—and a
 judge matter—it belief madman gone with
 story, blow stone, kicks, half
 dozen cuffs escaped.”
 
“in faith, sancho,” answered don quixote, “if thou knewest what
 honourable illustrious lady queen madasima was, know thou
 wouldst say great patience break pieces the

 say imagine queen made free surgeon. truth

“that say,” said sancho; “there occasion minding
 words madman; good luck helped worship,
 sent stone head instead breast, a
 fine way standing lady yonder, god
 confound her! then, cardenio gone free madman?”
 
“against men senses madmen,” said don quixote,
 “every knight-errant bound stand honour women,
 whoever may be, much queens high degree and

 beautiful, wise, patient misfortunes,

 ill-disposed vulgar took occasion say think his
 mistress; lie, say more, will lie two hundred
 times more, think say so.”
 
“i neither say think so,” said sancho; “let look it; with
 bread let eat it; rendered account god whether

 fond prying men’s lives; buys lies feels
 purse; moreover, naked born, naked find myself, i
 neither lose gain; did, me? many think
 flitches hooks; can put gates to
 open plain? moreover said god—”
 
“god bless me,” said don quixote, “what set absurdities thou art
 stringing together! talking got with
 proverbs thou art threading one other? god’s sake
 hold thy tongue, sancho, henceforward keep prodding thy ass and
 don’t meddle concern thee; understand thy

“señor,” replied sancho, “is good rule chivalry should

“peace, say again, sancho,” said don quixote, “for let tell thee
 much desire finding madman leads into

 achievement wherewith shall win eternal name fame throughout the
 known world; shall shall thereby set seal on

“and perilous, achievement?”
 
“no,” replied rueful countenance; “though may the
 dice may throw deuce-ace instead sixes; will depend
 thy diligence.”
 
“on diligence!” said sancho.
 
“yes,” said don quixote, “for thou dost return soon place
 mean send thee, penance will soon over, glory
 will soon begin. right keep thee longer in
 suspense, waiting see comes words, thee
 know, sancho, famous amadis gaul one most
 perfect knights-errant—i wrong say one; stood alone,
 first, one, lord world his
 time. fig don belianis, say equalled in

 say, too, painter desires become famous art he
 endeavours copy originals rarest painters knows;
 rule holds good important crafts and
 callings serve adorn state; thus must be
 esteemed prudent patient imitate ulysses, whose person and
 labours homer presents us lively picture prudence patience;
 virgil, too, shows us person Æneas virtue pious
 sagacity brave skilful captain; representing
 describing were, be, to
 leave example virtues posterity. way amadis
 polestar, day-star, sun valiant devoted knights, whom
 fight banner love chivalry bound to
 imitate. this, then, so, consider, friend sancho, the
 knight-errant shall imitate closely will come nearest to
 reaching perfection chivalry. now one instances which
 knight conspicuously showed prudence, worth, valour,
 endurance, fortitude, love, withdrew, rejected the
 lady oriana, penance upon peña pobre, changing name into
 beltenebros, name assuredly significant appropriate to
 life voluntarily adopted. so, easier me
 imitate cleaving giants asunder, cutting off
 serpents’ heads, slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying fleets,
 breaking enchantments, place well suited a
 similar purpose, must allow opportunity escape now
 conveniently offers forelock.”
 
“what reality,” said sancho, “that worship means in
 out-of-the-way place this?”
 
“have told thee,” answered don quixote, “that mean imitate
 amadis here, playing victim despair, madman, maniac, so
 time imitate valiant don roland, the
 fountain evidence fair angelica disgraced herself
 medoro grief thereat went mad, plucked trees,
 troubled waters clear springs, slew shepherds, destroyed

 mad things did, said, thought, will make rough
 copy best power seems essential;
 perhaps shall content simple imitation amadis,
 without giving way mischievous madness merely tears
 sorrow, gained much fame famous.”
 
“it seems me,” said sancho, “that knights behaved this
 way provocation cause follies penances; what
 cause worship going mad? lady rejected you, or
 evidence found prove lady dulcinea toboso
 trifling moor christian?”
 
“there point,” replied don quixote, “and beauty of
 business mine; thanks knight-errant going mad when
 cause; thing turn crazy without provocation, and
 let lady know, dry, the
 moist; moreover abundant cause long separation have
 endured lady till death, dulcinea toboso; thou didst
 hear shepherd ambrosio say day, absence ills are
 felt feared; so, friend sancho, waste time advising me
 rare, happy, unheard-of imitation; mad am,
 mad must thou returnest answer letter that
 mean send thee lady dulcinea; my
 constancy deserves, insanity penance will come end; if
 opposite effect, shall become mad earnest, and, being
 so, shall suffer more; thus whatever way may answer shall
 escape struggle affliction thou wilt leave me,
 enjoying senses boon thou bearest me, madman not
 feeling evil thou bringest me. tell me, sancho, hast thou got
 mambrino’s helmet safe? saw thee take ground when
 ungrateful wretch tried break pieces not, by
 fineness temper may seen.”
 
sancho made answer, “by living god, sir knight the
 rueful countenance, endure bear patience the
 things worship says; begin suspect that
 tell chivalry, winning kingdoms empires, and
 giving islands, bestowing rewards dignities the
 custom knights-errant, must made wind lies, all
 pigments figments, whatever may call them; would
 anyone think heard worship calling barber’s basin
 mambrino’s helmet without ever seeing mistake time, but
 one says maintains things must brains
 addled? basin sack dinted, taking home
 mended, trim beard it, if, god’s grace, am
 allowed see wife children day other.”
 
“look here, sancho,” said don quixote, “by thou didst swear just
 now swear thou hast limited understanding squire in
 world ever had. possible time thou hast
 going thou hast never found things
 belonging knights-errant seem illusions nonsense and
 ravings, go always contraries? really is
 so, always swarm enchanters attendance
 upon us change alter everything us, turn things as
 please, according disposed aid destroy us;
 thus seems thee barber’s basin seems mambrino’s helmet,
 another will seem something else; rare foresight was
 sage side make really truly
 mambrino’s helmet seem basin everybody, for, held such
 estimation is, world pursue rob it; but
 see barber’s basin take trouble
 obtain it; plainly shown tried break it, and
 left ground without taking it, for, faith, known
 never left behind. keep safe, friend, for
 just now need it; indeed, shall take all
 armour remain naked born, mind to
 follow roland rather amadis penance.”
 
thus talking reached foot high mountain stood like
 isolated peak among others surrounded it. past base
 flowed gentle brook, around spread meadow green and
 luxuriant delight eyes look upon it, forest
 trees abundance, shrubs flowers, added charms the
 spot. upon place knight rueful countenance fixed his
 choice performance penance, beheld it
 exclaimed loud voice though senses:
 
“this place, oh, ye heavens, select choose for
 bewailing misfortune ye plunged me: this

 yon little brook, deep endless sighs shall stir

 oh, ye wood nymphs dryads, dwell thickets the

 heaven grant thee full thou seekest it, bethink thee the

 return kindness due fidelity! oh, lonely trees,
 day forward shall bear company solitude, give
 sign gentle movement boughs presence is
 distasteful you! oh, thou, squire, pleasant companion my
 prosperous adverse fortunes, fix well thy memory thou shalt
 see here, thou mayest relate report sole

 instant relieved saddle bridle, giving slap the
 croup, said, “he gives thee freedom bereft himself, oh
 steed excellent deed thou art unfortunate thy lot; begone
 thou wilt, thou bearest written thy forehead neither
 astolfo’s hippogriff, famed frontino cost bradamante so

seeing sancho said, “good luck saved us trouble
 stripping pack-saddle dapple! faith have
 gone without slap croup something said praise;
 though let anyone strip him, there
 occasion, nothing lover victim of
 despair him, inasmuch master, was
 god’s pleasure, nothing sort; indeed, sir knight the
 rueful countenance, departure worship’s madness to
 come earnest, will well saddle rocinante in
 order may supply want dapple, will save me
 time going returning: go foot don’t know i
 shall get shall get back, am, truth, bad
 walker.”
 
“i declare, sancho,” returned don quixote, “it shall thou wilt,
 thy plan seem bad one, three days hence thou
 wilt depart, wish thee observe meantime and
 say sake, thou mayest able tell it.”
 
“but see besides seen?” said sancho.
 
“much thou knowest it!” said don quixote. “i now got tear
 garments, scatter armour, knock head these
 rocks, sort thing, thou must witness.”
 
“for love god,” said sancho, “be careful, worship, you
 give knocks head, may come across a
 rock, way, first may put end the
 whole contrivance penance; think, indeed knocks
 head seem necessary you, business done
 without them, might content—as whole thing feigned, and
 counterfeit, joke—you might content, say, giving them
 water, something soft, like cotton; and
 leave me; i’ll tell lady worship knocked
 head point rock harder diamond.”
 
“i thank thee thy good intentions, friend sancho,” answered don
 quixote, “but thee know things doing
 joke, much earnest, anything else a
 transgression ordinances chivalry, forbid us tell
 lie whatever penalties due apostasy; one
 thing instead another just lying; knocks the
 head must real, solid, valid, without anything sophisticated or
 fanciful them, will needful leave lint to
 dress wounds, since fortune compelled us without the
 balsam lost.”
 
“it worse losing ass,” replied sancho, “for lint and
 lost; beg worship remind that
 accursed liquor, soul, say stomach, turns hearing
 name it; beg you, too, reckon past three
 days allowed seeing mad things do, take them
 seen already pronounced upon, will tell wonderful stories
 lady; write letter send once, long to
 return take worship purgatory leaving
 you.”
 
“purgatory dost thou call it, sancho?” said don quixote, “rather call
 hell, even worse anything worse.”
 
“for one hell,” said sancho, “_nulla est retentio_, have
 heard say.”
 
“i understand _retentio_ means,” said don quixote.
 
“_retentio_,” answered sancho, “means whoever hell never
 comes can come it, will opposite case your
 worship legs will idle, spurs enliven
 rocinante: let get toboso presence my
 lady dulcinea, will tell things follies and
 madnesses (for one) worship done still

 purgatory seems hell not, hope of
 getting it; which, said, hell not, i
 believe worship will say anything contrary.”
 
“that true,” said rueful countenance, “but shall we
 manage write letter?”
 
“and ass-colt order too,” added sancho.
 
“all shall included,” said don quixote; “and paper,
 well done write leaves trees, the
 ancients did, tablets wax; though hard to
 find just now paper. just occurred may be
 conveniently even conveniently written, in
 notebook belonged cardenio, thou wilt take care have
 copied paper, good hand, first village thou comest to
 schoolmaster, not, sacristan will copy it;
 see thou give notary copy, write law

“but done signature?” said sancho.
 
“the letters amadis never signed,” said don quixote.
 
“that well,” said sancho, “but order must needs be
 signed, copied will say signature false, i
 shall left without ass-colts.”
 
“the order shall go signed book,” said don quixote, “and on
 seeing niece will make difficulty obeying it; the
 loveletter thou canst put way signature, ‘_yours till death, the

“so, so!” said sancho; “lorenzo corchuelo’s daughter lady
 dulcinea toboso, otherwise called aldonza lorenzo?”
 
“she is,” said don quixote, “and worthy lady
 whole universe.”
 
“i know well,” said sancho, “and let tell can fling a

“i now told thee many times, sancho,” said don quixote,
 “that thou art mighty great chatterer, blunt wit thou

 said one other:
 
“señor licentiate, horse sancho panza who, our
 adventurer’s housekeeper told us, went master esquire?”
 
“so is,” said licentiate, “and friend don quixote’s
 horse;” knew well the
 curate barber village, carried out
 scrutiny sentence upon books; soon they
 recognised sancho panza rocinante, anxious hear don
 quixote, approached, calling name curate said,
 “friend sancho panza, master?”
 
sancho recognised once, determined keep secret place
 circumstances left master, he
 replied master engaged certain quarter certain

“nay, nay,” said barber, “if don’t tell us is, sancho
 panza, will suspect suspect already, murdered

“there need threats me,” said sancho, “for man

 midst mountains;” then, offhand without stopping,
 told left him, adventures befallen him, and
 carrying letter lady dulcinea toboso, the
 daughter lorenzo corchuelo, head ears in
 love. amazed sancho panza told them; though
 aware don quixote’s madness nature it, each
 time heard filled fresh wonder. then
 asked sancho panza show letter carrying lady
 dulcinea toboso. said written notebook, his
 master’s directions copied paper the
 first village came to. curate said showed to
 him, make fair copy it. sancho put hand into
 bosom search notebook find it, nor, he
 searching now, found it, don quixote
 kept it, never given him, thought
 asking it. sancho discovered find book his
 face grew deadly pale, great haste felt body all
 over, seeing plainly found, without ado he
 seized beard hands plucked away half it, then,
 quick without stopping, gave half dozen
 cuffs face nose till bathed blood.
 
seeing this, curate barber asked happened him
 gave rough treatment.
 
“what happen me?” replied sancho, “but lost one
 hand other, moment, three ass-colts, like a

“how that?” said barber.
 
“i lost notebook,” said sancho, “that contained letter to

 told loss dapple.
 
curate consoled him, telling master found he

 usual customary; made notebooks never

sancho comforted this, said loss

 heart, taken wherever whenever they
 liked.
 
“repeat then, sancho,” said barber, “and will write down

 begged repeat letter couple times more, they

 refused enter. told them, moreover, lord, brought
 favourable answer lady dulcinea toboso, put

“they commonly give them,” said curate, simple benefice or

“but that,” said sancho, “the squire must unmarried, must

“be uneasy, friend sancho,” said barber, “for will entreat

“so thought,” said sancho; “though can tell fit for

 great eagerness beautiful lady was, wanted in
 out-of-the-way quarters.
 
“this fair lady, brother sancho,” replied curate, “is less a

 done her; fame good knight master has
 acquired far wide, princess come guinea seek him.”
 
“a lucky seeking lucky finding!” said sancho panza this;
 “especially master good fortune redress injury,

“she called princess micomicona,” said curate; “for her

“there’s doubt that,” replied sancho, “for known many to

“i will rise, señor,” answered afflicted damsel, “unless of
 courtesy boon ask first granted me.”
 
“i grant accord it,” said don quixote, “provided without detriment
 prejudice king, country, holds key my
 heart freedom, may complied with.”
 
“it will detriment prejudice them, worthy
 lord,” said afflicted damsel; sancho panza drew close to
 master’s ear said softly, “your worship may very
 safely grant boon asks; it’s nothing all; kill big
 giant; asks exalted princess micomicona, queen of
 great kingdom micomicon ethiopia.”
 
“let may,” replied don quixote, “i will my

 took armour, hung tree like trophy, and
 seen girths armed master trice, soon as
 found armour exclaimed:
 
“let us gone name god bring aid great lady.”
 
barber time knees great pains hide his
 laughter let beard fall, fallen maybe fine

“it will, sure,” said princess, “and sure, too, i

“that is,” said barber, alighting, offered his

curate hardly ceased speaking, sancho said, “in faith,
 then, señor licentiate, deed master; was
 want telling beforehand warning mind what
 about, set liberty, they
 march special scoundrels.”
 
“blockhead!” said don quixote this, “it business concern of
 knights-errant inquire whether persons affliction, chains,
 oppressed may meet high roads go way and
 suffer faults their
 misfortunes. concerns aid persons need of
 help, regard sufferings rascalities. i
 encountered chaplet string miserable unfortunate people,
 sense duty demands me, the
 rest may; whoever takes objection it, saving the
 sacred dignity señor licentiate honoured person, say
 knows little chivalry lies like whoreson villain, and
 will give know fullest extent sword;” and
 saying settled stirrups pressed his
 morion; barber’s basin, according mambrino’s
 helmet, carried hanging saddle-bow repair the
 damage done galley slaves.
 
dorothea, shrewd sprightly, time thoroughly
 understood don quixote’s crazy turn, except sancho panza
 making game him, behind rest said him, on
 observing irritation, “sir knight, remember boon have
 promised me, accordance must engage any
 adventure, ever pressing; calm yourself, the
 licentiate known galley slaves set free that
 unconquered arm stopped mouth thrice over, even
 bitten tongue three times said word that
 tended towards disrespect worship.”
 
“that swear heartily,” said curate, “and even
 plucked moustache.”
 
“i will hold peace, señora,” said don quixote, “and will curb the
 natural anger arisen breast, will proceed peace
 quietness fulfilled promise; return this
 consideration entreat tell me, objection do
 so, nature trouble, many, who, are
 persons require due satisfaction, am

“that will heart,” replied dorothea, “if will not
 wearisome hear miseries misfortunes.”
 
“it will wearisome, señora,” said don quixote; dorothea
 replied, “well, so, give attention.” soon she
 said this, cardenio barber drew close side, eager to
 hear sort story quick-witted dorothea invent for
 herself; sancho same, much taken as
 master; settled comfortably saddle,
 help coughing preliminaries taken time to
 think, began great sprightliness manner fashion.
 
“first all, know, sirs, name is—” here
 stopped moment, forgot name curate given
 her; came relief, seeing difficulty was, and
 said, “it wonder, señora, highness confused
 embarrassed telling tale misfortunes; such
 afflictions often effect depriving sufferers memory,
 even remember names, case now
 ladyship, forgotten called princess
 micomicona, lawful heiress great kingdom micomicon; with
 cue highness may now recall sorrowful recollection
 may wish tell us.”
 
“that truth,” said damsel; “but think shall
 need prompting, shall bring true story safe
 port, is. king father, called tinacrio
 sapient, learned call magic arts, became
 aware craft mother, called queen jaramilla, was

 life, left orphan without father mother. all

 possibility defending giant’s
 devilish power; followers set

 certain knight-errant whose fame time extend the
 whole kingdom, called, remember rightly, don
 azote don gigote.”
 
“‘don quixote,’ must said, señora,” observed sancho this,
 “otherwise called knight rueful countenance.”
 
“that it,” said dorothea; “he said, moreover, tall
 stature lank featured; right side left
 shoulder, thereabouts, grey mole hairs like
 bristles.”
 
hearing this, don quixote said squire, “here, sancho son,
 bear hand help strip, want see knight
 sage king foretold.”
 
“what worship want strip for?” said dorothea.
 
“to see mole father spoke of,” answered don
 quixote.
 
“there occasion strip,” said sancho; “for know worship
 just mole middle backbone, mark
 strong man.”
 
“that enough,” said dorothea, “for friends must look too
 closely trifles; whether shoulder the
 backbone matters little; enough mole, where
 may, flesh; doubt good father hit the
 truth every particular, made lucky hit commending
 don quixote; one father spoke of, the
 features countenance correspond assigned this
 knight wide fame acquired spain all
 mancha; scarcely landed osuna heard such
 accounts achievements, heart told the
 one come search of.”
 
“but land osuna, señora,” asked don quixote, “when is
 seaport?”
 
dorothea reply curate anticipated her, saying,
 “the princess meant say landed malaga the
 first place heard worship osuna.”
 
“that meant say,” said dorothea.
 
“and natural,” said curate. “will majesty
 please proceed?”
 
“there add,” said dorothea, “save finding don
 quixote good fortune, already reckon regard
 queen mistress entire dominions, since courtesy
 magnanimity granted boon accompanying me
 whithersoever may conduct him, will bring face

 foretold it, likewise left declared writing chaldee or
 greek characters (for read them), predicted
 knight, cut giant’s throat, disposed to
 marry offer without demur lawful
 wife, yield possession kingdom together person.”
 
“what thinkest thou now, friend sancho?” said don quixote this.
 “hearest thou that? tell thee so? see already got
 kingdom govern queen marry!”
 
“on oath so,” said sancho; “and foul fortune won’t
 marry slitting señor pandahilado’s windpipe! then, how
 illfavoured queen is! wish fleas bed sort!”
 
saying cut couple capers air every sign of
 extreme satisfaction, ran seize bridle dorothea’s
 mule, checking fell knees her, begging give
 hand kiss token acknowledgment queen
 mistress. bystanders helped laughing see
 madness master simplicity servant? dorothea
 therefore gave hand, promised make great lord her
 kingdom, heaven good permit recover and
 enjoy it, sancho returned thanks words set all
 laughing again.
 
“this, sirs,” continued dorothea, “is story; remains tell
 attendants took kingdom have
 none left except well-bearded squire, drowned a
 great tempest encountered sight port; came
 land couple planks miracle; indeed whole
 course life miracle mystery may observed;
 minute respect precise i
 ought, let accounted licentiate said the
 beginning tale, constant excessive troubles deprive the
 sufferers memory.”
 
“they shall deprive mine, exalted worthy princess,” said
 don quixote, “however great unexampled shall endure
 service may be; confirm anew boon have
 promised you, swear go end world until
 find presence fierce enemy, whose haughty head
 trust aid arm cut edge this—i will
 say good sword, thanks gines pasamonte carried away

 cut put peaceful possession of
 realm shall left decision dispose your
 person may pleasing you; long memory is
 occupied, will enslaved, understanding enthralled her—i
 say more—it impossible moment contemplate
 marriage, even phœnix.”
 
last words master wanting marry so
 disagreeable sancho raising voice exclaimed great
 irritation:
 
“by oath, señor don quixote, right senses; for
 can worship possibly object marrying exalted
 princess this? think fortune will offer behind every
 stone piece luck offered now? lady dulcinea
 fairer, perchance? she; half fair; will even go far
 say come shoe one here. poor
 chance getting county waiting worship
 goes looking dainties bottom sea. devil’s
 name, marry, marry, take kingdom comes hand without
 trouble, king make marquis governor a
 province, rest let devil take all.”
 
don quixote, heard blasphemies uttered lady
 dulcinea, endure it, lifting pike, without saying
 anything sancho uttering word, gave two thwacks
 brought ground; dorothea
 cried spare doubt taken life on
 spot.
 
“do think,” said pause, “you scurvy clown, that
 always interfering me, always
 offending always pardoning? don’t fancy it, impious scoundrel,
 beyond doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue going
 peerless dulcinea. know not, lout, vagabond, beggar,
 might infuses arm should
 strength enough kill flea? say, scoffer viper’s
 tongue, think won kingdom cut giant’s

 instrument achievements? fights conquers in
 me, live breathe her, owe life her. o
 whoreson scoundrel, ungrateful are, see raised
 dust earth titled lord, return make
 great benefit speak evil conferred it
 upon you!”
 
sancho stunned heard master said, and
 rising degree nimbleness ran place behind
 dorothea’s palfrey, position said master:
 
“tell me, señor; worship resolved marry great
 princess, plain kingdom will yours; so,
 can bestow favours upon me? complain of. let
 worship rate marry queen, now got her
 showered heaven, afterwards may go back to
 lady dulcinea; must kings world kept
 mistresses. beauty, nothing it; the
 truth told, like both; though never seen the
 lady dulcinea.”
 
“how! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!” exclaimed don quixote;
 “hast thou just now brought message her?”
 
“i mean,” said sancho, “that see much leisure
 take particular notice beauty, charms
 piecemeal; taken lump like her.”
 
“now forgive thee,” said don quixote; “and thou forgive the
 injury done thee; first impulses our
 control.”
 
“that see,” replied sancho, “and wish speak always
 first impulse, help saying, rate, i
 tip tongue.”
 
“for that, sancho,” said don quixote, “take heed thou
 sayest, pitcher goes often well—i need say to
 thee.”
 
“well, well,” said sancho, “god heaven, sees tricks, and
 will judge harm, speaking right, worship
 it.”
 
“that enough,” said dorothea; “run, sancho, kiss lord’s
 hand beg pardon, henceforward circumspect your
 praise abuse; say nothing disparagement lady toboso,
 know nothing save servant; put trust
 god, will fail obtain dignity live like
 prince.”
 
sancho advanced hanging head begged master’s hand, which
 don quixote dignity presented him, giving blessing as
 soon kissed it; bade go ahead little, he
 questions ask matters great importance discuss
 him. sancho obeyed, two gone distance in
 advance don quixote said him, “since thy return no
 opportunity time ask thee many particulars touching thy mission
 answer thou hast brought back, now chance granted
 us time opportunity, deny happiness thou canst give
 good news.”
 
“let worship ask will,” answered sancho, “for shall
 find way found way in; implore you, señor,
 revengeful future.”
 
“why dost thou say that, sancho?” said don quixote.
 
“i say it,” returned, “because blows just now more
 quarrel devil stirred us other
 night, said lady dulcinea, love and
 reverence relic—though nothing about
 her—merely something belonging worship.”
 
“say subject thy life, sancho,” said don quixote,
 “for displeasing me; already pardoned thee that,
 thou knowest common saying, ‘for fresh fresh penance.’”
 
going saw coming along road were
 following man mounted ass, came close seemed be
 gipsy; sancho panza, whose eyes heart wherever he
 saw asses, sooner beheld man knew gines de
 pasamonte; thread gipsy got ball, ass,
 was, fact, dapple carried pasamonte, escape
 recognition sell ass disguised gipsy, being
 able speak gipsy language, many more, well they
 own. sancho saw recognised him, instant did
 shouted him, “ginesillo, thief, give treasure,
 release life, embarrass thyself repose, quit ass,
 leave delight, off, rip, get thee gone, thief, give what
 thine.”
 
necessity many words objurgations, the
 first one gines jumped down, like racing speed made and
 got clear all. sancho hastened dapple, embracing him
 said, “how hast thou fared, blessing, dapple eyes, my
 comrade?” kissing caressing a
 human being. ass held peace, let kissed and
 caressed sancho without answering single word. came up
 congratulated found dapple, don quixote especially,
 told notwithstanding cancel order
 three ass-colts, sancho thanked him.
 
two going along conversing fashion, the
 curate observed dorothea shown great cleverness, as
 well story conciseness, resemblance it
 bore books chivalry. said many
 times amused reading them; know the
 situation provinces seaports, said at
 haphazard landed osuna.
 
“so saw,” said curate, “and reason made haste say
 did, set right. strange
 thing see readily unhappy gentleman believes these
 figments lies, simply style manner of
 absurdities books?”
 
“so is,” said cardenio; “and uncommon unexampled, were
 one attempt invent concoct fiction, doubt be
 wit keen enough imagine it.”
 
“but another strange thing it,” said curate, “is that, apart
 silly things worthy gentleman says connection
 craze, subjects dealt with, can discuss them
 perfectly rational manner, showing mind quite clear
 composed; that, provided chivalry touched upon, no
 one take anything man thoroughly sound
 understanding.”
 
holding conversation don quixote continued his
 sancho, saying:
 
“friend panza, let us forgive forget quarrels, tell
 now, dismissing anger irritation, where, how, didst
 thou find dulcinea? doing? didst thou say her?
 answer? look reading letter?
 copied thee? everything matter seems to
 thee worth knowing, asking, learning; neither adding falsifying
 give pleasure, yet curtailing lest deprive of
 it.”
 
“señor,” replied sancho, “if truth told, nobody copied out
 letter me, carried letter all.”
 
“it thou sayest,” said don quixote, “for notebook i
 wrote found possession two days thy departure,
 gave great vexation, knew thou wouldst do
 finding thyself without letter; made sure thou wouldst
 return place thou didst first miss it.”
 
“so done,” said sancho, “if got heart
 worship read me, repeated sacristan,
 copied hearing it, exactly said in
 days life, though read many letter of
 excommunication, never seen read pretty letter that.”
 
“and hast thou got still thy memory, sancho?” said don quixote.
 
“no, señor,” replied sancho, “for soon repeated it, seeing
 use it, set forgetting it; i
 recollect it, ‘scrubbing,’ mean say
 ‘sovereign lady,’ end ‘yours till death, knight the
 rueful countenance;’ two put than
 three hundred ‘my souls’ ‘my life’s’ ‘my eyes.”

“then depend upon it,” said don quixote, “the grains wheat were

“it neither, red,” said sancho.

“when went give her,” replied sancho, “she hard it

 occupation converse hold thee? ask about

“she asked nothing,” said sancho; “but told worship
 left penance service, naked waist up, in

“in saying cursed fortune thou saidst wrong,” said don quixote;
 “for rather bless shall bless days life

“and lofty is,” said sancho, “that overtops than

“what! sancho,” said don quixote, “didst thou measure her?”
 
“i measured way,” said sancho; “going help put sack

“well!” said don quixote, “and doth truth accompany and

“it that,” said don quixote, “but thou must been

 well scent rose among thorns, lily of

“maybe so,” replied sancho; “there often comes same

 that’s wonder, one devil like another.”
 
“well then,” continued don quixote, “now done sifting corn

“that must it,” said sancho, “for indeed rocinante went like

“quicksilver!” said don quixote, “aye more, legion of

“look here, sancho,” said don quixote. “if thou art advising to

dainty repast finished, saddled once, without

 rather entered it, help it. landlady, the
 landlord, daughter, maritornes, saw don quixote and
 sancho coming, went welcome signs hearty
 satisfaction, don quixote received dignity gravity, and
 bade make better bed last time: the
 landlady replied paid better last time she
 give one fit prince. don quixote said would, they
 made tolerable one garret before; he
 lay once, sorely shaken want sleep.
 
sooner door shut upon landlady made the
 barber, seizing beard, said:
 
“by faith going make beard tail longer;
 must give back tail, shame way thing of

 astonishment beauty dorothea, even comely figure
 shepherd cardenio. curate made get ready fare as
 inn, landlord, hope better payment,
 served tolerably good dinner. time don quixote was
 asleep, thought best waken him, sleeping would
 now good eating.
 
dinner, company consisting landlord, wife,
 daughter, maritornes, travellers, discussed the
 strange craze don quixote manner found;
 landlady told taken place the
 carrier; then, looking round see sancho there, she
 saw not, gave whole story blanketing, which
 received little amusement. curate observing
 books chivalry don quixote read had
 turned brain, landlord said:
 
“i understand can be, truth mind is
 better reading world, two three them,
 writings life, of
 plenty more; harvest-time, reapers flock on
 holidays, always one among can read takes
 one books, gather round him, thirty us,
 stay listening delight makes grey hairs grow
 young again. least can say hear what
 furious terrible blows knights deliver, seized the
 longing same, like hearing night
 day.”
 
“and just much,” said landlady, “because never quiet
 moment house except listening someone reading;
 taken time forget to
 scold.”
 
“that true,” said maritornes; “and, faith, relish hearing these
 things greatly too, pretty; especially they
 describe lady another arms knight the
 orange trees, duenna keeping watch half dead
 envy fright; say good honey.”
 
“and you, think, young lady?” said curate turning to
 landlord’s daughter.
 
“i don’t know indeed, señor,” said she; “i listen too, tell the
 truth, though understand it, like hearing it; not
 blows father likes like, laments knights
 utter separated ladies; indeed they
 sometimes make weep pity feel them.”
 
“then console wept, young lady?”
 said dorothea.
 
“i don’t know do,” said girl; “i know there
 ladies cruel call knights tigers
 lions thousand foul names: jesus! don’t know what
 sort folk can be, unfeeling heartless, rather than
 bestow glance upon worthy man leave die go mad. i
 don’t know good prudery; honour’s
 sake, marry them? that’s want.”
 
“hush, child,” said landlady; “it seems thou knowest great
 deal things, fit girls know talk so
 much.”
 
“as gentleman asked me, help answering him,” said the
 girl.
 
“well then,” said curate, “bring books, señor landlord,
 like see them.”
 
“with heart,” said he, going room brought
 old valise secured little chain, opening the
 curate found three large books manuscripts written a
 good hand. first opened found “don cirongilio
 thrace,” second “don felixmarte hircania,” other
 “history great captain gonzalo hernandez cordova, with
 life diego garcía paredes.”
 
curate read two first titles looked barber
 said, “we want friend’s housekeeper niece now.”
 
“nay,” said barber, “i can just well carry the
 yard hearth, good fire there.”
 
“what! worship burn books!” said landlord.
 
“only two,” said curate, “don cirongilio, felixmarte.”
 
“are books, then, heretics phlegmatics want burn
 them?” said landlord.
 
“schismatics mean, friend,” said barber, “not phlegmatics.”
 
“that’s it,” said landlord; “but want burn any, let be
 great captain diego garcía; rather
 child mine burnt either others.”
 
“brother,” said curate, “those two books made lies, and
 full folly nonsense; great captain true
 history, contains deeds gonzalo hernandez cordova, by
 many great achievements earned title world of

hearing dorothea said whisper cardenio, “our landlord is
 almost fit play second part don quixote.”
 
“i think so,” said cardenio, “for, shows, accepts a
 certainty everything books relate took place exactly it
 written down; barefooted friars not
 persuade contrary.”
 
“but consider, brother,” said curate more, “there never was
 felixmarte hircania world, cirongilio thrace,

 chivalry talk of; whole thing fabrication invention of
 idle wits, devised purpose describe beguiling

“try bone another dog,” said landlord; “as not
 know many make five, shoe pinches me; don’t think to

 nonsense lies, printed license lords the
 royal council, people allow lot of
 lies printed together, many battles enchantments
 take away one’s senses.”
 
“i told you, friend,” said curate, “that done to
 divert idle thoughts; well-ordered states games chess,
 fives, billiards allowed diversion not

 allowed printed, supposition that, indeed the
 truth, can nobody ignorant take true

“no fear that,” returned landlord; “i shall mad to

 much troubled cast heard said about

chapter xxxiii.
 related novel “the ill-advised curiosity”
 
florence, rich famous city italy province called
 tuscany, lived two gentlemen wealth quality, anselmo and
 lothario, great friends way distinction were
 called knew “the two friends.” unmarried,
 young, age tastes, enough to
 account reciprocal friendship them. anselmo, is
 true, somewhat inclined seek pleasure love than
 lothario, pleasures chase attraction; but
 occasion anselmo forego tastes yield of
 lothario, lothario surrender fall of
 anselmo, way inclinations kept pace one the
 concord perfect best regulated clock not

anselmo deep love high-born beautiful maiden the
 city, daughter parents estimable, estimable

 without nothing, ask marriage, did
 so, lothario bearer demand, conducting the
 negotiation much satisfaction friend short
 time possession object desires, camilla so
 happy won anselmo husband, gave thanks
 unceasingly heaven lothario, whose means good fortune
 fallen her. first days, wedding usually
 days merry-making, lothario frequented friend anselmo’s house as
 wont, striving honour occasion, and
 gratify every way could; wedding days were
 succession visits congratulations slackened, he
 began purposely leave going house anselmo, it
 seemed him, naturally men sense, friends’
 houses visited marriage frequency
 masters’ bachelor days: because, though true genuine
 friendship way suspicious, still a
 married man’s honour thing delicacy held liable
 injury brothers, much friends. anselmo remarked the
 cessation lothario’s visits, complained him, saying
 known marriage keep enjoying his
 society used, never married; that, the
 thorough harmony subsisted bachelor
 earned sweet name “the two friends,” he
 allow title rare delightful lost a
 needless anxiety act circumspectly; entreated him, such
 phrase allowable them, master his
 house come go formerly, assuring wife
 camilla desire inclination would
 wish have, knowing sincerely loved one another
 grieved see coldness him.
 
much anselmo said lothario persuade him
 come house habit doing, lothario
 replied much prudence, sense, judgment, anselmo was
 satisfied friend’s good intentions, agreed on
 two days week, holidays, lothario come dine
 him; though arrangement made lothario
 resolved observe considered in
 accordance honour friend, whose good name to

 heaven bestowed beautiful wife consider carefully what
 friends brought house female friends wife

 confidence reposed. lothario said, too, every married man
 friend point negligence he
 might guilty conduct, will sometimes happen that
 owing deep affection husband bears wife either does
 caution her, or, vex her, refrains telling or
 certain things, avoiding may matter of
 honour reproach him; errors kind easily
 correct warned friend. friend found
 lothario have, judicious, loyal, true?
 
truth know not; lothario alone one, the
 utmost care vigilance watched honour friend, and
 strove diminish, cut down, reduce number days going
 house according agreement, lest visits young
 man, wealthy, high-born, attractions conscious of
 possessing, house woman beautiful camilla, be
 regarded suspicion inquisitive malicious eyes the
 idle public. though integrity reputation might bridle
 slanderous tongues, still unwilling hazard either own
 good name friend; reason days
 agreed upon devoted business pretended was
 unavoidable; great portion day taken with
 complaints one side excuses other. happened, however,
 one occasion two strolling together outside the
 city, anselmo addressed following words lothario.
 
“thou mayest suppose, lothario friend, unable give
 sufficient thanks favours god rendered making the
 parents mine were, bestowing upon niggard
 hand called gifts nature well fortune,
 done giving thee friend and
 camilla wife—two treasures value, highly i

 oppressed desire strange unusual, wonder at

 endeavouring deliberately publish world; and
 as, short, must come out, confide thy safe keeping,
 feeling sure means, thy readiness true friend
 afford relief, shall soon find freed distress
 causes me, thy care will give happiness same
 degree folly caused misery.”
 
words anselmo struck lothario astonishment, unable he
 conjecture purport lengthy preamble; though he
 strove imagine desire troubled friend,
 conjectures far truth, relieve anxiety
 perplexity causing him, told a
 flagrant injustice great friendship seeking circuitous
 methods confiding hidden thoughts, well knew
 might reckon upon counsel diverting them, help in
 carrying effect.
 
“that truth,” replied anselmo, “and relying upon will
 tell thee, friend lothario, desire harasses that

 therefore, thou wouldst enjoy can called life, thou
 wilt engage love struggle, lukewarmly nor

 loyalty friendship assures of.”
 
words anselmo addressed lothario, listened them
 attention that, except say already
 mentioned, open lips finished. then
 perceiving say, regarding while,
 one regard something never seen excited wonder and
 amazement, said him, “i persuade myself, anselmo my
 friend, thou hast said jest; thought
 thou wert speaking seriously allowed thee go
 far; put stop thy long harangue listening to

 lothario; misfortune is, seems me, thou art the
 anselmo thou wert, must thought lothario i

 anselmo friend, thou demandest me

 prove friends make use them, poet said, _usque ad

 heathen’s feeling friendship, much a
 christian’s, knows divine must forfeited the
 sake human friendship? friend go far to
 put aside duty heaven fulfil duty friend, it
 matters trifling little moment, in

 consequently without life? listen me, anselmo friend, not
 impatient answer said occurs touching the
 object thy desire, will time enough left thee to

“be so,” said anselmo, “say thou wilt.”
 
lothario went say, “it seems me, anselmo, thine is

said this, wise virtuous lothario silent, and

lothario seeing fixed determination anselmo, knowing

 dissuade it, perceiving threatened confide his
 pernicious scheme someone else, avoid greater evil resolved to
 gratify asked, intending manage business so
 satisfy anselmo without corrupting mind camilla; in
 reply told communicate purpose other, he
 undertake task himself, begin soon he
 pleased. anselmo embraced warmly affectionately, thanked
 offer bestowed great favour upon him; and
 agreed set next day, anselmo
 affording opportunity time lothario converse alone with
 camilla, furnishing money jewels offer present
 her. suggested, too, treat music, write
 verses praise, unwilling take trouble of
 composing them, offered himself. lothario agreed all
 intention different anselmo supposed, with
 understanding returned anselmo’s house, found
 camilla awaiting husband anxiously uneasily, later
 usual returning day. lothario repaired house,
 anselmo remained his, well satisfied lothario troubled
 mind; see satisfactory way ill-advised
 business. night, however, thought plan might
 deceive anselmo without injury camilla. next day went to
 dine friend, welcomed camilla, received and
 treated great cordiality, knowing affection husband
 felt him. dinner cloth removed, anselmo told
 lothario stay camilla attended pressing
 business, return hour half. camilla begged him
 go, lothario offered accompany him, nothing could
 persuade anselmo, contrary pressed lothario remain
 waiting matter great importance discuss with
 him. time bade camilla leave lothario alone until
 came back. short contrived put good face the
 reason, folly, absence one suspected
 pretence.
 
anselmo took departure, camilla lothario left alone at
 table, rest household gone dinner. lothario
 saw lists according friend’s wish, facing an
 enemy beauty alone vanquish squadron armed
 knights; judge whether good reason fear; was
 lean elbow arm chair, cheek upon hand,
 and, asking camilla’s pardon ill manners, said wished to
 take little sleep anselmo returned. camilla reply said he
 repose ease reception-room chair,
 begged go sleep there; lothario declined, and
 remained asleep return anselmo, finding
 camilla room, lothario asleep, imagined had
 stayed away long afforded time enough for
 conversation even sleep, impatience lothario
 wake up, might go question to
 success. everything fell wished; lothario awoke, the
 two left house, anselmo asked anxious to
 know, lothario answer told thought it
 advisable declare entirely first time, therefore had
 extolled charms camilla, telling city

 angel light, and, cover fair seeming,
 discloses length, effects purpose the
 beginning wiles discovered. gave great
 satisfaction anselmo, said afford same
 opportunity every day, without leaving house, find
 things home camilla detect plot.
 
thus, then, several days went by, lothario, without uttering word
 camilla, reported anselmo talked he
 never able draw slightest indication of
 consent anything dishonourable, even sign shadow hope;
 contrary, said inform husband it.
 
“so far well,” said anselmo; “camilla thus far resisted words; we
 must now see will resist deeds. will give to-morrow two
 thousand crowns gold offer even present, many
 buy jewels lure her, women fond becomingly
 attired going gaily dressed, are
 beautiful, however chaste may be; resists this
 temptation, will rest satisfied will give trouble.”
 
lothario replied now begun carry the
 undertaking end, though perceived come it
 wearied vanquished. next day received four thousand
 crowns, four thousand perplexities, knew what
 say way new falsehood; end made mind to
 tell camilla stood firm gifts promises as
 words, use taking trouble,
 time spent purpose.
 
chance, directing things different manner, ordered that
 anselmo, left lothario camilla alone occasions,

 half hour lothario utter word camilla, nor
 utter word though age; came
 conclusion friend told replies
 camilla invention falsehood, ascertain were
 so, came out, calling lothario aside asked news had
 humour camilla was. lothario replied not
 disposed go business, answered so
 angrily harshly heart say anything her.
 
“ah, lothario, lothario,” said anselmo, “how ill dost thou meet thy
 obligations me, great confidence repose thee! have
 just now watching keyhole, seen thou
 hast said word camilla, whence conclude former
 occasions thou hast spoken either, so, no
 doubt is, dost thou deceive me, wherefore seekest thou by
 craft deprive means might find attaining desire?”
 
anselmo said more, said enough cover lothario with
 shame confusion, he, feeling honour touched by
 detected lie, swore anselmo that
 moment devote satisfying without deception, he
 see curiosity watch; though need take the
 trouble, pains take satisfy remove all
 suspicions mind. anselmo believed him, afford an
 opportunity free less liable surprise, resolved to
 absent house eight days, betaking that
 friend lived village far city; and,
 better account departure camilla, arranged it
 friend send pressing invitation.
 
unhappy, shortsighted anselmo, art thou doing, art thou
 plotting, art thou devising? bethink thee thou art working against
 thyself, plotting thine dishonour, devising thine ruin. thy
 wife camilla virtuous, thou dost possess peace quietness,
 one assails thy happiness, thoughts wander beyond walls
 thy house, thou art heaven earth, object wishes,

next day anselmo took departure village, leaving
 instructions camilla absence lothario come
 look house dine her, treat
 himself. camilla distressed, discreet and
 right-minded woman be, orders husband left her, and
 bade remember becoming anyone occupy
 seat table absence, acted thus not
 feeling confidence able manage house, let him
 try time, find experience equal
 greater responsibilities. anselmo replied pleasure
 so, submit obey. camilla said
 so, though will.
 
anselmo went, next day lothario came house, was
 received camilla friendly modest welcome; never
 suffered lothario see alone, always attended her
 men women servants, especially handmaid hers, leonela by
 name, much attached (for brought up
 together childhood father’s house), kept
 marriage anselmo. first three days lothario
 speak her, though might done removed
 cloth servants retired dine hastily; were
 camilla’s orders; nay more, leonela directions dine earlier than
 camilla never leave side. she, however, thoughts
 fixed upon things taste, wanting time and
 opportunity pleasures, always obey mistress’s
 commands, contrary left alone, ordered
 so; modest bearing camilla, calmness her
 countenance, composure aspect enough bridle the
 tongue lothario. influence many virtues camilla
 exerted imposing silence lothario’s tongue proved mischievous for
 them, tongue silent thoughts busy, and
 dwell leisure upon perfections camilla’s goodness and
 beauty one one, charms enough warm love marble statue, not
 say heart flesh. lothario gazed upon might have
 speaking her, thought worthy loved was;
 thus reflection began little little assail allegiance to
 anselmo, thousand times thought withdrawing city
 going anselmo never see see camilla. but
 already delight found gazing interposed held him
 fast. put constraint upon himself, struggled repel and
 repress pleasure found contemplating camilla; alone he
 blamed weakness, called bad friend, nay bad
 christian; argued matter compared anselmo;
 always coming conclusion folly rashness anselmo
 worse faithlessness, excuse his
 intentions easily god man, reason fear

short beauty goodness camilla, joined the
 opportunity blind husband placed hands, overthrew
 loyalty lothario; giving heed nothing save object
 towards inclinations led him, anselmo three
 days absent, carrying continual struggle
 passion, began make love camilla much
 vehemence warmth language overwhelmed with
 amazement, rise place retire room
 without answering word. hope always springs with
 love weakened lothario repelling demeanour; the
 contrary passion camilla increased, discovering him
 never expected, knew do; considering it
 neither safe right give chance opportunity of
 speaking again, resolved send, very
 night, one servants letter anselmo, she
 addressed following words him.

“it commonly said army looks ill without general a

anselmo received letter, gathered lothario had
 already begun task camilla must replied he
 wished; delighted beyond measure intelligence he
 sent word leave house account, would
 shortly return. camilla astonished anselmo’s reply, which
 placed greater perplexity before, neither dared to
 remain house, yet go parents’; in
 remaining virtue imperilled, going opposing her
 husband’s commands. finally decided upon worse course
 her, remain, resolving fly presence lothario,

 began regret written husband, fearing he

 leonela alone knew mistress’s weakness, two false
 friends new lovers unable conceal it. lothario care

 afforded opportunity attaining result, lest she
 undervalue love think chance without
 intending accord made love her.
 
days later anselmo returned house perceive
 lost, lightly treated highly
 prized. went see lothario, found home; they
 embraced other, anselmo asked tidings life or
 death.
 
“the tidings give thee, anselmo friend,” said lothario,
 “are thou dost possess wife worthy pattern and
 crown good wives. words addressed were

anselmo completely satisfied words lothario, believed
 fully spoken oracle; nevertheless he
 begged relinquish undertaking, the
 sake curiosity amusement; though thenceforward need make
 use earnest endeavours before; wished do
 write verses her, praising name of
 chloris, give understand in
 love lady given name enable sing
 praises decorum due modesty; lothario were
 unwilling take trouble writing verses compose
 himself.
 
“that will necessary,” said lothario, “for muses not

 ill-advised one treacherous, anselmo returning house
 asked camilla question already wondered asked
 before—what caused write letter sent
 him. camilla replied seemed lothario looked at
 somewhat freely home; now
 undeceived believed own
 imagination, lothario now avoided seeing her, alone with
 her. anselmo told might quite easy score that
 suspicion, knew lothario love damsel rank

 lothario love chloris pretence, himself
 told anselmo order able sometimes give utterance
 praises camilla herself, doubt fallen into
 despairing toils jealousy; forewarned received the
 startling news without uneasiness.
 
next day three table anselmo asked lothario to
 recite something composed mistress chloris; for
 camilla know her, might safely say liked.
 
“even know her,” returned lothario, “i hide nothing, for

sonnet pleased camilla, still anselmo, praised it
 said lady excessively cruel made return for

 love-smitten poets say true?”
 
“as poets tell truth,” replied lothario; “but lovers

“there doubt that,” observed anselmo, anxious support and
 uphold lothario’s ideas camilla, regardless his

 mounted, opinion, towards summit virtue fair

happened finding one occasion alone her
 maid, camilla said her, “i ashamed think, dear leonela, how

 influence brought bear upon me.”
 
“let trouble you, lady,” said leonela, “for not
 take away value thing given make less precious to
 give quickly really valuable worthy prized;
 nay, wont say gives quickly gives twice.”
 
“they say also,” said camilla, “that costs little valued less.”
 
“that saying hold good case,” replied leonela, “for
 love, heard say, sometimes flies sometimes walks; with
 one runs, moves slowly; cools, others it
 burns; wounds, others slays; begins course its

camilla laughed maid’s alphabet, perceived more
 experienced love affairs said, admitted,
 confessing camilla love passages young man of
 good birth city. camilla uneasy this, dreading lest
 might prove means endangering honour, asked whether
 intrigue gone beyond words, little shame much
 effrontery said had; certain ladies’ imprudences make
 servants shameless, who, see mistresses make false
 step, think nothing going astray themselves, known.
 camilla entreat leonela say nothing about
 doings called lover, conduct own
 affairs secretly lest come knowledge anselmo or
 lothario. leonela said would, kept word way
 confirmed camilla’s apprehension losing reputation
 means; abandoned bold leonela, soon she
 perceived mistress’s demeanour wont be,
 audacity introduce lover house, confident that
 even mistress saw dare expose him; the
 sins mistresses entail mischief among others; make
 slaves servants, obliged hide
 laxities depravities; case camilla, who
 though perceived, many times, leonela with
 lover room house, dare chide
 her, afforded opportunities concealing removed all
 difficulties, lest seen husband. unable,
 however, prevent seen one occasion, sallied
 forth daybreak, lothario, who, knowing was, first
 took spectre; but, soon saw hasten away,
 muffling face cloak concealing carefully and
 cautiously, rejected foolish idea, adopted another, which
 ruin camilla found remedy. did
 occur lothario man seen issuing an
 untimely hour anselmo’s house entered leonela’s
 account, even remember person leonela;
 thought camilla light yielding with
 him, another; penalty erring
 woman’s brings it, honour distrusted even him
 whose overtures persuasions yielded; believes her
 surrendered easily others, gives implicit credence
 every suspicion comes mind. lothario’s good sense
 seems failed juncture; prudent maxims
 escaped memory; without reflecting rationally, without
 ado, impatience blindness jealous rage
 gnawed heart, dying revenge upon camilla, who
 done wrong, anselmo risen hastened and
 said him, “know, anselmo, several days past been
 struggling myself, striving withhold thee no
 longer possible right conceal thee. know that
 camilla’s fortress surrendered ready submit will;

 guilty one, may feared rather expected, silence,
 prudence, discretion thou canst thyself become instrument of

anselmo amazed, overwhelmed, astounded words of
 lothario, came upon time least expected hear
 them, now looked upon camilla triumphed the
 pretended attacks lothario, beginning enjoy glory of
 victory. remained silent considerable time, looking the
 ground fixed gaze, length said, “thou hast behaved,
 lothario, expected thy friendship: will follow thy advice in
 everything; thou wilt, keep secret thou seest it
 kept circumstances unlooked for.”
 
lothario gave word, leaving repented
 altogether said him, perceiving foolishly had
 acted, might revenged upon camilla less
 cruel degrading way. cursed want sense, condemned his
 hasty resolution, knew course take undo mischief
 find ready escape it. last decided upon revealing
 camilla, and, want opportunity so,
 found alone day; she, soon chance
 speaking him, said, “lothario friend, must tell thee have

camilla said lothario first imagined device to
 delude idea man seen going was
 leonela’s lover hers; saw wept and
 suffered, begged help her, became convinced truth,

 told camilla distress herself, take measures put

“i tell you,” said camilla, “there nothing take care except to

lothario retired, next day anselmo, pretence of
 going friend’s country house, took departure, then
 returned conceal himself, able easily, camilla
 leonela took care give opportunity; placed

“what, friend?” replied camilla, “we shall leave anselmo to

anselmo listening this, every word camilla uttered
 made change mind; heard resolved to
 kill lothario first impulse come show to
 avert disaster; anxiety see issue a
 resolution bold virtuous restrained himself, intending to
 come forth time prevent deed. moment camilla,
 throwing upon bed close by, swooned away, and
 leonela began weep bitterly, exclaiming, “woe me! should
 fated dying arms flower virtue upon earth,
 crown true wives, pattern chastity!” the
 effect, anyone heard taken the
 tender-hearted faithful handmaid world, her
 mistress another persecuted penelope.
 
camilla long recovering fainting fit coming
 said, “why go, leonela, call hither that
 friend, falsest friend sun ever shone upon night

“i just going call him, señora,” said leonela; “but must
 first give dagger, lest gone means of

“go peace, dear leonela, will so,” said camilla, “for rash

leonela required much pressing go summon lothario,

 speaking herself, “good god! more

lothario dull first moment camilla

 others begged finish it, he, willing please
 them, enjoyed reading himself, continued tale these
 words:
 
result was, confidence anselmo felt camilla’s
 virtue, lived happy free anxiety, camilla purposely
 looked coldly lothario, anselmo might suppose feelings
 towards opposite were; better to
 support position, lothario begged excused coming the
 house, displeasure camilla regarded presence was
 plain seen. befooled anselmo said account
 allow thing, thousand ways became author of
 dishonour, believed insuring happiness.
 meanwhile satisfaction leonela saw empowered to
 carry amour reached height that, regardless everything
 else, followed inclinations unrestrainedly, feeling confident
 mistress screen her, even show manage it

 trying enter see was, found door was

 exerting strength forced open, entered room in

 quickly seize discover was, unable to
 effect either purpose, leonela flung arms round crying, “be
 calm, señor; give way passion follow escaped

anselmo believe it, blind rage drew dagger and
 threatened stab leonela, bidding tell truth kill
 her. she, fear, knowing saying, exclaimed, “do
 kill me, señor, can tell things important any
 can imagine.”
 
“tell thou diest,” said anselmo.
 
“it impossible now,” said leonela, “i agitated:
 leave till to-morrow, shall hear will fill
 astonishment; rest assured leaped the
 window young man city, given promise to

anselmo appeased this, content wait time she
 asked him, never expected hear anything camilla,
 satisfied sure virtue he; quitted room,
 left leonela locked in, telling come until
 told make known him. went to
 see camilla, tell her, did, passed him
 handmaid, promise given inform him

need saying whether camilla agitated not, so
 great fear dismay, that, making sure, good
 reason do, leonela tell anselmo knew her

 suspicions confirmed; night, soon thought
 anselmo asleep, packed valuable jewels had

 camilla reduced lothario unable utter
 word reply, still less decide upon do. length
 resolved conduct convent sister was

 circumstances demanded, lothario took convent left her
 there, quitted city without letting anyone know of
 departure.
 
soon daylight came anselmo, without missing camilla his
 side, rose eager learn leonela tell him, hastened to

 was, without delaying dress completely, repaired, sad at

“not least,” said citizen, “though governor been

“god speed you, señor,” said anselmo.
 
“god you,” said citizen went way.
 
disastrous intelligence almost robbed anselmo his

 contained words:
 
“a foolish ill-advised desire robbed life. news of

“and heard called name?” asked curate.
 
“no, indeed,” replied servant; “they preserve marvellous

“that may well be,” said curate, leaving returned to

 dorothea, holding lady arms, raising eyes saw

 imagining came luscinda burst forth terror the

 luscinda, cardenio, dorothea, stood silent amazement scarcely

gazed one another without speaking, dorothea don fernando,

 don fernando: “leave me, señor don fernando, sake you

meanwhile dorothea come herself, heard luscinda’s words,

 clasped round knees, kissing holding to
 prevent moving, said, tears continued flow, “what
 thou wouldst do, refuge, unforeseen event? thou
 hast thy wife thy feet, thou wouldst thy wife

 thee, whether will possible thee undo heaven has
 done, whether will becoming thee seek raise be
 thy mate spite every obstacle, strong truth and
 constancy, thine eyes, bathing tears love the

 thine implore thee, let open manifestation rouse thy
 anger; rather calm allow two lovers live in
 peace quiet without interference thee long heaven
 permits them; thou wilt prove generosity thy
 lofty noble spirit, world shall see thee reason has
 influence passion.”
 
time dorothea speaking, cardenio, though held luscinda
 arms, never took eyes don fernando, determined, he
 saw make hostile movement, try defend resist
 best might assail him, though cost him
 life. now don fernando’s friends, well curate the
 barber, present while, forgetting worthy
 sancho panza, ran forward gathered round don fernando, entreating
 regard tears dorothea, suffer her
 reasonable hopes disappointed, since, firmly believed,
 said truth; bidding observe was
 not, might seem, accident, special disposition of
 providence met place one have
 expected meeting. curate bade remember death
 part luscinda cardenio; even sword to
 separate think death happy; a
 case admitted remedy wisest course was, conquering
 putting constraint upon himself, show generous mind, of
 accord suffer two enjoy happiness heaven had
 granted them. bade him, too, turn eyes upon beauty of
 dorothea see equal much less excel
 her; beauty added modesty the
 surpassing love bore him. besides this, reminded him
 prided gentleman christian, he
 otherwise keep plighted word; doing
 obey god meet approval sensible people, who
 know recognised privilege beauty, even one of
 humble birth, provided virtue accompany it, able raise itself
 level rank, without slur upon places upon
 equality himself; furthermore potent sway of
 passion asserts itself, long mixture it, he
 blamed gives way it.
 
brief, added forcible arguments don
 fernando’s manly heart, nourished noble blood, was
 touched, yielded truth which, even wished it, he
 gainsay; showed submission, acceptance the
 good advice offered him, stooping and
 embracing dorothea, saying her, “rise, dear lady, right
 hold heart kneeling feet; if

 heaven’s decree order that, seeing constancy love

 cardenio, knees pray heaven allow live
 dorothea;” words embraced and
 pressed face much tenderness take
 great heed keep tears completing proof love and
 repentance sight all. luscinda, cardenio, and
 almost others, shed many tears, own
 happiness, others, one supposed a
 heavy calamity fallen upon all. even sancho panza weeping;
 though afterwards said wept saw dorothea was
 fancied queen micomicona, expected great
 favours. wonder well weeping lasted time, and
 cardenio luscinda went fell knees don
 fernando, returning thanks favour rendered in
 language grateful knew answer them, raising

 cardenio similar state mind, luscinda’s thoughts ran in

 reflections upon whole affair, congratulated upon good
 fortune; one highest spirits good humour
 landlady, promise cardenio curate had
 given pay losses damage sustained
 don quixote’s means. sancho, already said, the
 one distressed, unhappy, dejected; long
 face went master, just awoke, said him:
 
“sir rueful countenance, worship may well sleep much as
 like, without troubling killing giant or
 restoring kingdom princess; settled
 now.”
 
“i think was,” replied don quixote, “for most
 prodigious stupendous battle giant ever remember
 days life; one back-stroke—swish!—i
 brought head tumbling ground, much blood gushed forth
 ran rivulets earth like water.”
 
“like red wine, worship better say,” replied sancho; “for i
 know, don’t know it, dead giant a
 hacked wine-skin, blood four-and-twenty gallons red wine
 belly, cut-off head bitch bore
 me; devil take all.”
 
“what art thou talking about, fool?” said don quixote; “art thou thy
 senses?”
 
“let worship get up,” said sancho, “and will see nice
 business made it, pay; will see
 queen turned private lady called dorothea, things
 will astonish you, understand them.”
 
“i shall surprised anything kind,” returned don
 quixote; “for thou dost remember last time told
 thee everything happened matter enchantment,
 wonder now.”
 
“i believe that,” replied sancho, “if blanketing the
 sort thing also; wasn’t, real genuine; i
 saw landlord, to-day, holding one end blanket
 jerking skies neatly smartly, as
 much laughter strength; comes case knowing
 people, hold part, simple sinner am, no
 enchantment all, great deal bruising bad
 luck.”
 
“well, well, god will give remedy,” said don quixote; “hand my
 clothes let go out, want see transformations and
 things thou speakest of.”
 
sancho fetched clothes; dressing, curate
 gave don fernando others present account don quixote’s
 madness stratagem made use withdraw from
 pena pobre fancied stationed his
 lady’s scorn. described also nearly adventures that
 sancho mentioned, marvelled laughed little,
 thinking it, did, strangest form madness crazy
 intellect capable of. now, curate said, lady
 dorothea’s good fortune prevented proceeding their
 purpose, necessary devise discover way of
 getting home.
 
cardenio proposed carry scheme begun, suggested
 luscinda act support dorothea’s part sufficiently well.
 
“no,” said don fernando, “that must be, want dorothea to
 follow idea hers; worthy gentleman’s village is
 far off, shall happy can anything his
 relief.”
 
“it two days’ journey this,” said curate.
 
“even more,” said don fernando, “i gladly travel so
 far sake good work.”
 
moment don quixote came full panoply, mambrino’s
 helmet, dinted was, head, buckler arm, and
 leaning staff pike. strange figure presented filled
 don fernando rest amazement contemplated lean
 yellow face half league long, armour sorts, the
 solemnity deportment. stood silent waiting see he
 say, he, fixing eyes fair dorothea, addressed her
 great gravity composure:
 
“i informed, fair lady, squire greatness has
 annihilated abolished, since, queen lady
 high degree used be, turned private
 maiden. done command magician king your
 father, fear afford aid need and
 entitled to, may tell know know half
 mass, little versed annals chivalry; for, he
 read gone attentively deliberately i
 have, found every turn knights less renown
 mine accomplished things difficult: great
 matter kill whelp giant, however arrogant may be; it
 many hours since engaged one, and—i will not
 speak it, may say lying; time, however, that
 reveals all, will tell tale least expect it.”
 
“you engaged couple wine-skins, giant,” said
 landlord this; don fernando told hold tongue and
 account interrupt don quixote, continued, “i say in
 conclusion, high disinherited lady, father brought
 metamorphosis person reason have
 mentioned, attach importance it; is
 peril earth sword will force way, with
 it, many days over, will bring enemy’s head the
 ground place crown kingdom.”
 
don quixote said more, waited reply princess, who
 aware don fernando’s determination carry deception until
 don quixote conveyed home, great ease manner
 gravity made answer, “whoever told you, valiant knight the
 rueful countenance, undergone change transformation
 tell truth, yesterday. is
 true certain strokes good fortune, given than
 hoped for, made alteration me; not
 therefore ceased before, entertain same
 desire availing might your
 valiant invincible arm. so, señor, let goodness reinstate
 father begot good opinion, assured he
 wise prudent man, since craft found sure
 easy way remedying misfortune; believe, señor, had
 never lit upon good fortune now
 possess; saying perfectly true; of
 gentlemen present can fully testify. remains is
 set journey to-morrow, to-day make much
 way; rest happy result looking forward to, i
 trust god valour heart.”
 
said sprightly dorothea, hearing don quixote turned
 sancho, said him, angry air, “i declare now, little
 sancho, thou art greatest little villain spain. say, thief and
 vagabond, hast thou just now told princess been
 turned maiden called dorothea, head am
 persuaded cut giant bitch bore thee, and
 nonsense put greatest perplexity ever been
 life? vow” (and looked heaven ground his
 teeth) “i mind play mischief thee, way that
 will teach sense future lying squires knights-errant
 world.”
 
“let worship calm, señor,” returned sancho, “for may well be
 mistaken change lady princess
 micomicona; giant’s head, least piercing
 wine-skins, blood red wine, make mistake, as
 sure god; wounded skins head
 worship’s bed, wine made lake room; not
 will see eggs come fried; mean worship
 landlord calls damages: rest, heartily
 glad ladyship queen was, concerns as
 much anyone.”
 
“i tell thee again, sancho, thou art fool,” said don quixote;
 “forgive me, will do.”
 
“that will do,” said don fernando; “let us say it; as
 ladyship princess proposes set to-morrow is
 late to-day, it, will pass night pleasant
 conversation, to-morrow will accompany señor don quixote;
 wish witness valiant unparalleled achievements is
 perform course mighty enterprise has
 undertaken.”
 
“it shall wait upon accompany you,” said don quixote; “and
 much gratified favour bestowed upon me, the
 good opinion entertained me, shall strive justify it
 shall cost life, even more, can possibly cost more.”
 
many compliments expressions politeness passed
 don quixote don fernando; brought end
 traveller moment entered inn, seemed from
 attire christian lately come country moors,
 dressed short-skirted coat blue cloth with
 half-sleeves without collar; breeches also blue
 cloth, cap colour, wore yellow buskins and
 moorish cutlass slung baldric across breast. behind
 him, mounted upon ass, came woman dressed moorish
 fashion, face veiled scarf head, wearing a
 little brocaded cap, mantle covered shoulders
 feet. man robust well-proportioned frame, in
 age little forty, rather swarthy complexion, long
 moustaches full beard, and, short, appearance such
 well dressed taken person
 quality good birth. entering asked room, when
 told none inn seemed distressed, and
 approaching dress seemed moor, took down
 saddle arms. luscinda, dorothea, landlady, her
 daughter maritornes, attracted strange, entirely
 new costume, gathered round her; dorothea, always kindly,
 courteous, quick-witted, perceiving man who
 brought annoyed finding room, said her, “do
 put out, señora, discomfort want luxuries here,
 way road-side inns without them; still, you
 will pleased share lodging us (pointing luscinda)
 perhaps will found worse accommodation course your
 journey.”
 
veiled lady made reply; rise her
 seat, crossing hands upon bosom, bowing head bending
 body sign returned thanks. silence they
 concluded must moor unable speak christian
 tongue.
 
moment captive came up, now otherwise
 engaged, seeing stood round companion that
 made reply addressed her, said, “ladies, this
 damsel hardly understands language can speak none of
 country, reason answer what
 asked her.”
 
“nothing asked her,” returned luscinda; “she been
 offered company evening share quarters we
 occupy, shall made comfortable circumstances
 allow, good-will bound show strangers stand
 need it, especially woman service is
 rendered.”
 
“on part own, señora,” replied captive, “i kiss your
 hands, esteem highly, ought, favour offered,
 which, occasion coming persons appearance,
 is, plain see, great one.”
 
“tell me, señor,” said dorothea, “is lady christian moor?
 dress silence lead us imagine we
 wish not.”
 
“in dress outwardly,” said he, “she moor, heart is
 thoroughly good christian, greatest desire become
 one.”
 
“then baptised?” returned luscinda.
 
“there opportunity that,” replied captive, “since
 left algiers, native country home; present
 found imminent danger death to
 make necessary baptise instructed all
 ceremonies holy mother church ordains; but, please god, ere
 long shall baptised solemnity befitting is
 higher dress mine indicates.”
 
words excited desire heard him, know who
 moorish lady captive were, one liked ask just
 then, seeing fitter moment helping rest
 questioning lives. dorothea took
 moorish lady hand leading seat beside herself,
 requested remove veil. looked captive to
 ask meant do. said in
 arabic asked take veil, thereupon she
 removed disclosed countenance lovely, dorothea she
 seemed beautiful luscinda, luscinda beautiful
 dorothea, bystanders felt beauty could
 compare moorish lady’s, even
 inclined give somewhat preference. it
 privilege charm beauty win heart secure
 good-will, forthwith became eager show kindness attention to
 lovely moor.
 
don fernando asked captive name was, replied that
 lela zoraida; instant heard him, guessed what
 christian asked, said hastily, displeasure and
 energy, “no, zoraida; maria, maria!” giving understand that
 called “maria” “zoraida.” words, touching
 earnestness uttered them, drew one tear from
 listeners, particularly women, nature
 tender-hearted compassionate. luscinda embraced affectionately,
 saying, “yes, yes, maria, maria,” moor replied, “yes, yes,
 maria; zoraida macange,” means “not zoraida.”
 
night now approaching, orders accompanied
 don fernando landlord taken care pains prepare them
 best supper power. hour therefore having
 arrived took seats long table like refectory one,
 round square table none inn, seat of
 honour head it, though refusing it, assigned
 don quixote, desired lady micomicona place his
 side, protector. luscinda zoraida took places
 next her, opposite don fernando cardenio, next the
 captive gentlemen, side ladies, the
 curate barber. supped high enjoyment, was
 increased observed don quixote leave eating, and, moved
 impulse like made deliver length
 supped goatherds, begin address them:
 
“verily, gentlemen, reflect upon it, great marvellous the
 things see, make profession order knight-errantry.
 say, world, entering gate this
 castle moment, seeing us here, suppose or
 imagine us are? say lady is
 beside great queen know be, am
 knight rueful countenance, trumpeted far wide the
 mouth fame? now, can doubt art calling
 surpasses mankind invented, more
 deserving held honour proportion more
 exposed peril. away assert letters the
 preeminence arms; will tell them, whosoever may be, that
 know say. reason persons commonly
 assign, upon chiefly rest, is, labours the
 mind greater body, arms give employment
 body alone; calling porter’s trade, which
 nothing required sturdy strength; if, who
 profess call arms, included acts vigour the
 execution high intelligence requisite; soul of
 warrior, army, defence city his
 care, exert much mind body. nay; see whether
 bodily strength possible learn divine intentions of
 enemy, plans, stratagems, obstacles, ward off
 impending mischief; work mind, them
 body share whatever. since, therefore, arms need the
 mind, much letters, let us see now two minds, that
 man letters warrior, do; this
 will seen end goal seeks attain; that
 purpose estimable aim nobler object.
 end goal letters—i speaking now divine letters,
 aim raise direct soul heaven; an
 end infinite can compared—i speak human letters, the
 end establish distributive justice, give every man
 his, see take care good laws observed:
 end undoubtedly noble, lofty, deserving high praise, not
 given sought arms, their
 end object peace, greatest boon men can desire this
 life. first good news world mankind received which
 angels announced night day, sang in
 air, ‘glory god highest, peace earth men of
 good-will;’ salutation great master heaven and
 earth taught disciples chosen followers entered any
 house, say, ‘peace house;’ many times he
 said them, ‘my peace give unto you, peace leave you, peace be
 you;’ jewel precious gift given left hand: a
 jewel without can happiness either earth in
 heaven. peace true end war; war another name
 arms. this, then, admitted, end war peace, and
 far advantage end letters, let us turn to
 bodily labours man letters, follows
 profession arms, see greater.”
 
don quixote delivered discourse manner such
 correct language, time made impossible any
 hearers consider madman; contrary, were
 mostly gentlemen, arms appurtenance birth, they
 listened great pleasure continued: “here, then, say

“putting this, however, aside, puzzling question which

 afterwards say wanted. excited fresh pity had
 heard see man apparently sound sense, rational

finished supper, cloth removed, the

 wanting compliance, tell it. curate others
 thanked added entreaties, finding so

 weight, added, “if worships will give attention you
 will hear true story which, perhaps, fictitious ones constructed with

 anchored cove two crossbow shots garden
 zoraida waiting; renegade, together the
 two moorish lads rowed, used purposely station himself, either
 going prayers, else practising part meant
 perform earnest. thus go zoraida’s garden ask
 fruit, father gave him, knowing him; though, as
 afterwards told me, sought speak zoraida, tell who
 was, orders take land the
 christians, might feel satisfied easy, never
 able so; moorish women allow be
 seen moor turk, unless husband father bid them: with
 christian captives permit freedom intercourse and
 communication, even might considered proper. my
 part sorry spoken her, perhaps it
 might alarmed find affairs talked renegades. but
 god, ordered otherwise, afforded opportunity our
 renegade’s well-meant purpose; he, seeing safely go to
 shershel return, anchor liked, and
 tagarin partner will his, that, now was
 ransomed, wanted find christians row, told to
 look willing take me, above
 ransomed, engage next friday,
 fixed upon departure. spoke twelve
 spaniards, stout rowers, easily leave the

 twenty ships cruise taken the
 rowers them; found that

 purest algiers, possessing also two hundred

 everyone knows, beauty women times its

approached father told language a

took conversation, mixture tongues have
 spoken asked gentleman, not

answered already ransomed, price might
 seen value master set me, given one thousand
 five hundred zoltanis me; replied, “hadst thou my
 father’s, can tell thee, let part thee for
 twice much, christians always tell lies and
 make poor cheat moors.”
 
“that may be, lady,” said i; “but indeed dealt truthfully my
 master, mean everybody world.”
 
“and dost thou go?” said zoraida.
 
“to-morrow, think,” said i, “for vessel france
 sails to-morrow, think shall go her.”
 
“would better,” said zoraida, “to wait arrival of
 ships spain go french not
 friends?”
 
“no,” said i; “though intelligence vessel now
 coming spain true might, perhaps, wait it; however, it
 likely shall depart to-morrow, longing feel to
 return country love great will not
 allow wait another opportunity, however convenient, if
 delayed.”
 
“no doubt thou art married thine country,” said zoraida, “and
 reason thou art anxious go see thy wife.”
 
“i married,” replied, “but given promise marry on
 arrival there.”
 
“and lady beautiful thou hast given it?” said zoraida.
 
“so beautiful,” said i, “that, describe worthily tell thee
 truth, like thee.”
 
father laughed heartily said, “by allah,
 christian, must beautiful like daughter, who
 beautiful woman kingdom: look well
 thou wilt see telling truth.”
 
zoraida’s father better linguist helped interpret of
 words phrases, though spoke bastard language,
 that, said, employed there, expressed meaning more
 signs words.
 
still engaged conversation, moor came running
 up, exclaiming four turks leaped fence wall the
 garden, gathering fruit though yet ripe. the
 old man alarmed zoraida too, moors commonly, and, to
 speak, instinctively dread turks, particularly the
 soldiers, insolent domineering moors are
 power treat worse their
 slaves. father said zoraida, “daughter, retire house
 shut thyself go speak dogs; thou,
 christian, pick thy herbs, go peace, allah bring thee safe
 thy country.”
 
bowed, went away look turks, leaving alone with
 zoraida, made retire father bade
 her; moment concealed trees garden,
 turning eyes full tears said, “tameji, cristiano,
 tameji?” say, “art thou going, christian, art thou going?”
 
made answer, “yes, lady, without thee, come may: on
 watch next juma, alarmed thou seest

said way understood perfectly passed

 steps move towards house; fate (and it

 said, “no doubt fainted alarm entrance those

 sighing, eyes still wet tears, said again, “ameji,

 “there need, daughter, christian go, done

 nothing hurt thee, say, turks request gone

 good behaviour, think simple imagine will

renegade interpreted us moor said daughter; she,
 however, returned answer. observed one corner of

 answer will give thee will serve all; thee know that
 christian, file our
 chains deliverer captivity. free

“daughter, true, says?” cried moor.
 
“it is,” replied zoraida.
 
“that thou art truth christian,” said old man, “and thou
 hast given thy father power enemies?”
 
zoraida made answer, “a christian am, who
 placed thee position, never wish leave
 thee thee harm, good myself.”
 
“and good hast thou done thyself, daughter?” said he.
 
“ask thou that,” said she, “of lela marien, can tell thee

 till day comes; trust god arrange affair so
 may happy ending innocent beginning deserves.”
 
“ah, señora,” said doña clara, “what end can hoped his
 father lofty position, wealthy, think i
 fit even servant son, much less wife? to
 marrying without knowledge father, all
 world. ask anything youth go
 back leave me; perhaps seeing him, long distance
 shall travel, pain suffer now may become easier;
 though daresay remedy propose will little good. i
 don’t know devil come about, love have
 got in; young girl, mere boy; i
 verily believe age, sixteen yet; i
 will sixteen michaelmas day, next, father says.”
 
dorothea help laughing hear like child doña clara
 spoke. “let us go sleep now, señora,” said she, “for little of
 night fancy left us: god will soon send us daylight,
 will set rights, will go hard me.”
 
fell asleep, deep silence reigned the
 inn. persons asleep landlady’s daughter her
 servant maritornes, who, knowing weak point don quixote’s
 humour, outside inn mounting guard armour on
 horseback, resolved, pair them, play trick upon him, or
 rate amuse listening his
 nonsense. happened window whole inn
 looked outwards except hole wall straw-loft through
 used throw straw. hole two
 demi-damsels posted themselves, observed don quixote horse,
 leaning pike time time sending forth deep and
 doleful sighs, seemed pluck soul roots with
 them; hear him, too, saying soft, tender,
 loving tone, “oh lady dulcinea toboso, perfection beauty,
 summit crown discretion, treasure house grace, depositary of
 virtue, finally, ideal good, honourable, and
 delectable world! thy grace now? art thou,
 perchance, mindful thy enslaved knight free will hath

 envious hers, thou art regarding her, either paces fro

 occasion) thy jealousy love.”
 
don quixote got far pathetic speech landlady’s
 daughter began signal him, saying, “señor, come here,
 please.”
 
signals voice don quixote turned head saw the
 light moon, full splendour, someone
 calling hole wall, seemed be
 window, more, gilt grating, rich castles, such
 believed inn be, have; immediately
 suggested imagination that, former occasion,
 fair damsel, daughter lady castle, overcome by
 love him, endeavouring win affections; and
 idea, show discourteous, ungrateful, he
 turned rocinante’s head approached hole, perceived
 two wenches said:
 
“i pity you, beauteous lady, directed your
 thoughts love quarter whence impossible a
 return can made due great merit gentle
 birth, must blame unhappy knight-errant whom
 love renders incapable submission whom, the
 first moment eyes beheld her, made absolute mistress his
 soul. forgive me, noble lady, retire apartment, not,
 declaration passion, compel show myself
 ungrateful; if, love bear me, find that
 anything else power wherein can gratify you, provided
 love itself, demand me; swear that
 sweet absent enemy mine grant instant, though that
 require lock medusa’s hair, snakes, or
 even beams sun shut vial.”
 
“my mistress wants nothing sort, sir knight,” said maritornes
 this.
 
“what then, discreet dame, mistress wants?” replied don
 quixote.
 
“only one fair hands,” said maritornes, “to enable vent
 great passion, passion brought this
 loophole, much risk honour; lord father
 heard her, least slice cut ear.”
 
“i like see tried,” said don quixote; “but better
 beware that, want meet disastrous end
 ever father world met laid hands tender
 limbs love-stricken daughter.”
 
maritornes felt sure don quixote present hand had
 asked, making mind do, got hole
 went stable, took halter sancho panza’s
 ass, haste returned hole, just don quixote had
 planted standing rocinante’s saddle order reach the
 grated window supposed lovelorn damsel be; giving
 hand, said, “lady, take hand, rather scourge of

“that shall see presently,” said maritornes, making running

don quixote, feeling roughness rope wrist, exclaimed,
 “your grace seems grating rather caressing hand; treat it
 harshly, blame offence resolution
 given you, just wreak vengeance small a
 part; remember one loves well revenge so
 cruelly.”
 
nobody now listen words don quixote’s, for
 soon maritornes tied made off, ready to
 die laughing, leaving fastened way was
 impossible release himself.

 hole wrist tied bolt door, in
 mighty fear dread left hanging arm rocinante

 ladies retired, began fancy was

 enchanted moor carrier belaboured him; cursed in
 heart want sense judgment venturing enter the

 try might seat saddle, nothing it

 worthy squire sancho panza, who, buried sleep stretched upon the
 pack-saddle ass, oblivious, moment, mother

“what devil fortress castle this,” said one, “to make us
 stand ceremony? innkeeper bid open us;
 travellers want feed horses go on, we

“do think, gentlemen, look like innkeeper?” said don
 quixote.
 
“i don’t know look like,” replied other; “but know that
 talking nonsense call inn castle.”
 
“a castle is,” returned don quixote, “nay, more, one best in
 whole province, within people the

“it better way,” said traveller, “the

loud, fact, shouts don quixote, landlord
 opening gate inn haste, came dismay, ran
 see uttering cries, outside joined
 him. maritornes, time roused same
 outcry, suspecting was, ran loft and, without anyone
 seeing her, untied halter don quixote suspended, and
 came ground sight landlord the
 travellers, approaching asked matter that
 shouted so. without replying word took rope wrist,
 rising feet leaped upon rocinante, braced buckler his
 arm, put lance rest, making considerable circuit the
 plain came back half-gallop exclaiming:
 
“whoever shall say enchanted just cause, provided
 lady princess micomicona grants permission so, give
 lie, challenge defy single combat.”
 
newly arrived travellers amazed words don quixote;
 landlord removed surprise telling was, and
 mind senses. asked the
 landlord chance youth fifteen years age had
 come inn, one dressed like muleteer, an
 appearance, describing doña clara’s lover. landlord replied
 many people inn noticed person
 inquiring for; one observing coach which
 judge come, said, “he doubt, coach
 following: let one us stay gate, rest go to
 look him; indeed well one us went round the
 inn, lest escape wall yard.” “so it,” said
 another; two went in, one remained gate and
 made circuit inn; observing which, the
 landlord unable conjecture reason taking all
 precautions, though understood looking youth
 whose description given him.
 
time broad daylight; reason, well in
 consequence noise don quixote made, everybody awake and
 up, particularly doña clara dorothea; able to
 sleep badly night, one agitation lover
 near her, curiosity see him. don quixote, he
 saw one four travellers took notice or
 replied challenge, furious ready die indignation
 wrath; found ordinances chivalry
 lawful knight-errant undertake engage in
 another enterprise, plighted word faith to
 involve made end one he
 pledged, attacked whole them, have
 made return answer spite themselves. considering that
 become him, right, begin new emprise until
 established micomicona kingdom, constrained to
 hold peace wait quietly see upshot the
 proceedings travellers; one found youth they
 seeking lying asleep side muleteer, without thought
 anyone coming search him, much less finding him.
 
man laid hold arm, saying, “it becomes well
 indeed, señor don luis, dress wear, well bed
 find agrees luxury mother reared
 you.”
 
youth rubbed sleepy eyes stared held
 him, presently recognised one father’s servants, at
 taken aback time find or
 utter word; servant went say, “there nothing for
 now, señor don luis, submit quietly return home, unless
 wish lord, father, take departure
 world, nothing else can consequence the
 grief absence.”
 
“but father know gone road this
 dress?” said don luis.
 
“it student confided intentions,” answered the
 servant, “that disclosed them, touched pity distress saw
 father suffer missing you; therefore despatched four his
 servants quest you, service, better
 pleased can imagine shall return soon able
 restore eyes yearn you.”
 
“that shall please, heaven orders,” returned don luis.
 
“what can please heaven order,” said other, “except agree
 go back? anything else impossible.”
 
conversation two overheard muleteer at
 whose side don luis lay, rising, went report taken
 place don fernando, cardenio, others, time
 dressed themselves; told man addressed youth
 “don,” words passed, wanted return to
 father, youth unwilling do. this, what
 already knew rare voice heaven bestowed upon him,
 felt anxious know particularly was, and
 even help attempted employ force him; so
 hastened still talking arguing his
 servant. dorothea instant came room, followed by
 doña clara tremor; calling cardenio aside, told in
 words story musician doña clara, the
 time told happened, father’s servants had
 come search him; telling so, speak low
 enough doña clara heard said, much
 agitated dorothea hastened support have
 fallen ground. cardenio bade dorothea return room,
 endeavour make whole matter right, as
 desired. four come quest don luis now come
 inn surrounded him, urging return console his
 father without moment’s delay. replied could
 account concluded business which
 life, honour, heart stake. servants pressed him,
 saying certainly return without him, that
 take away whether liked not.
 
“you shall that,” replied don luis, “unless take dead;
 though however take me, will without life.”
 
time inn attracted the
 dispute, particularly cardenio, don fernando, companions, the
 judge, curate, barber, don quixote; now considered
 necessity mounting guard castle longer.
 cardenio already acquainted young man’s story, asked the
 men wanted take away, object seeking to
 carry youth will.
 
“our object,” said one four, “is save life father,
 danger losing gentleman’s disappearance.”
 
upon don luis exclaimed, “there need make affairs
 public here; free, will return please; not, none
 shall compel me.”
 
“reason will compel worship,” said man, “and no
 power you, power us, make us came for,
 duty do.”
 
“let us hear whole affair about,” said judge this;
 man, knew neighbour theirs, replied, “do you
 know gentleman, señor judge? neighbour,
 run away father’s house dress unbecoming his
 rank, worship may perceive.”
 
judge looked carefully recognised him, and
 embracing said, “what folly this, señor don luis, can
 cause induced come this
 way, dress, ill becomes condition?”
 
tears came eyes young man, unable utter a
 word reply judge, told four servants be
 uneasy, satisfactorily settled; taking don
 luis hand, drew aside asked reason having
 come there.
 
questioning heard loud outcry gate
 inn, cause two guests had
 passed night there, seeing everybody busy finding it
 four men wanted, conceived idea going without
 paying owed; landlord, minded affairs
 people’s, caught going gate and
 demanded reckoning, abusing dishonesty such
 language drove reply fists, they
 began lay style poor man forced cry
 out, call help. landlady daughter see one
 free give aid don quixote, daughter said,
 “sir knight, virtue god given you, help poor father, for
 two wicked men beating mummy.”
 
don quixote deliberately phlegmatically replied,
 “fair damsel, present moment request inopportune, i
 debarred involving adventure brought
 happy conclusion one word pledged me; that
 can will now mention: run tell your
 father stand ground well can battle, no
 account allow vanquished, go request
 permission princess micomicona enable succour in
 distress; grants it, rest assured will relieve him
 it.”
 
“sinner am,” exclaimed maritornes, stood by; “before you
 got permission master will world.”
 
“give leave, señora, obtain permission speak of,” returned
 don quixote; “and get it, will matter little in
 world; will rescue thence spite same
 world can do; rate will give revenge those
 shall sent will moderately
 satisfied;” without saying anything went knelt before
 dorothea, requesting highness knightly errant phrase be
 pleased grant permission aid succour castellan of
 castle, now stood grievous jeopardy. princess granted
 graciously, once, bracing buckler arm and
 drawing sword, hastened inn-gate, two guests were
 still handling landlord roughly; soon reached spot
 stopped short stood still, though maritornes landlady
 asked hesitated help master husband.
 
“i hesitate,” said don quixote, “because lawful to
 draw sword persons squirely condition; call squire
 sancho me; defence vengeance affair and
 business.”
 
thus matters stood inn-gate, lively
 exchange fisticuffs punches, sore damage landlord
 wrath maritornes, landlady, daughter, who
 furious saw pusillanimity don quixote, the
 hard treatment master, husband father undergoing. let
 us leave there; will surely find someone help him, if
 not, let suffer hold tongue attempts his
 strength allows do; let us go back fifty paces see what
 don luis said reply judge left questioning him
 privately reasons coming foot meanly dressed.
 
youth, pressing hand way showed heart
 troubled great sorrow, shedding flood tears, made
 answer:
 
“señor, tell moment when,
 heaven’s will near neighbours, first saw doña
 clara, daughter lady, instant made the
 mistress will, yours, true lord father, offers no
 impediment, day shall become wife. left my
 father’s house, assumed disguise, follow her
 whithersoever may go, arrow seeks mark sailor the
 pole-star. knows nothing passion may have
 learned sometimes seen distance eyes were
 filled tears. know already, señor, wealth noble birth
 parents, sole heir; sufficient
 inducement venture make completely happy, accept at
 son; father, influenced objects his
 own, disapprove happiness sought myself, time
 power alter change things, human will.”
 
love-smitten youth silent, judge, after
 hearing him, astonished, perplexed, surprised, well the
 manner intelligence don luis confessed secret of
 heart, position found himself, knowing
 course take matter sudden unexpected. the
 answer, therefore, gave bid make mind easy for
 present, arrange servants take back that
 day, might time consider best all
 parties. don luis kissed hands force, nay, bathed his
 tears, way touched heart marble, say
 judge, who, shrewd man, already perceived how
 advantageous marriage daughter; though, it
 possible, preferred brought with
 consent father don luis, knew looked title
 son.
 
guests time made peace landlord, for, by
 persuasion don quixote’s fair words threats, had
 paid demanded, servants don luis waiting
 end conversation judge master’s
 decision, devil, never sleeps, contrived barber,
 don quixote taken mambrino’s helmet, sancho panza the
 trappings ass exchange own, this
 instant enter inn; said barber, led ass the
 stable, observed sancho panza engaged repairing something other
 belonging pack-saddle; moment saw knew it, and
 made bold attack sancho, exclaiming, “ho, sir thief, caught
 you! hand basin pack-saddle, trappings that
 robbed of.”
 
sancho, finding unexpectedly assailed, hearing abuse
 poured upon him, seized pack-saddle one hand, the
 gave barber cuff bathed teeth blood. the
 barber, however, ready relinquish prize made
 pack-saddle; contrary, raised outcry that
 everyone inn came running know noise quarrel
 meant. “here, name king justice!” cried, “this
 thief highwayman wants kill trying recover my
 property.”
 
“you lie,” said sancho, “i highwayman; fair war my
 master don quixote won spoils.”
 
don quixote standing time, highly pleased see his
 squire’s stoutness, offensive defensive, time
 forth reckoned man mettle, heart resolved dub
 knight first opportunity presented itself, feeling
 sure order chivalry fittingly bestowed upon him.
 
course altercation, among things barber said,
 “gentlemen, pack-saddle mine surely owe god death,
 know well given birth it, ass
 stable will let lie; try it, not
 fit like glove, call rascal; more, day
 robbed this, robbed likewise new brass basin,
 never yet handselled, fetch crown day.”
 
don quixote keep answering; and
 interposing two, separating them, placed the
 pack-saddle ground, lie sight truth was
 established, said, “your worships may perceive clearly plainly
 error worthy squire lies calls basin
 was, is, shall helmet mambrino won him
 fair war, made master legitimate lawful
 possession. pack-saddle concern myself; may
 tell head squire sancho asked permission to
 strip caparison vanquished poltroon’s steed, with
 adorn own; allowed him, took it; having
 changed caparison pack-saddle, can give no
 explanation except usual one, transformations will take
 place adventures chivalry. confirm which, run, sancho my
 son, fetch hither helmet good fellow calls basin.”
 
“egad, master,” said sancho, “if proof case
 worship puts forward, mambrino’s helmet just much
 basin good fellow’s caparison pack-saddle.”
 
“do bid thee,” said don quixote; “it everything in
 castle goes enchantment.”
 
sancho hastened basin was, brought back him,
 don quixote saw it, took hold said:
 
“your worships may see face squire can assert that
 basin helmet told of; swear the
 order chivalry profess, helmet identical one i
 took him, without anything added taken it.”
 
“there doubt that,” said sancho, “for time master
 won now fought one battle it, let loose
 unlucky men chains; this
 basin-helmet come well time, there
 plenty stone-throwing affair.”

“what think now, gentlemen,” said barber, “of these
 gentles say, want make helmet?”
 
“and whoever says contrary,” said don quixote, “i will let know
 lies knight, squire lies a
 thousand times.”
 
barber, present this, understood don
 quixote’s humour thoroughly, took head back his
 delusion carry joke general amusement; addressing
 barber said:
 
“señor barber, whatever are, must know belong your
 profession too, licence practise twenty
 years, know implements barber craft, every one of
 them, perfectly well; likewise soldier time the
 days youth, know also helmet is, morion, a
 headpiece visor, things pertaining soldiering, i
 meant say soldiers’ arms; say—saving better opinions and
 always submission sounder judgments—that piece now
 us, worthy gentleman hands, no
 barber’s basin, far one white black,
 truth falsehood; say, moreover, this, although a
 helmet, complete helmet.”
 
“certainly not,” said don quixote, “for half wanting, is
 say beaver.”
 
“it quite true,” said curate, saw object friend
 barber; cardenio, don fernando companions agreed with
 him, even judge, thoughts full don
 luis’s affair, helped carry joke; so
 taken serious matters mind paid
 little attention facetious proceedings.
 
“god bless me!” exclaimed butt barber this; “is it
 possible honourable company can say a
 basin helmet? why, thing astonish whole
 university, however wise might be! will do; basin a
 helmet, why, pack-saddle must horse’s caparison, this
 gentleman said.”
 
“to looks like pack-saddle,” said don quixote; “but have
 already said question concern myself.”
 
“as whether pack-saddle caparison,” said curate, “it is
 señor don quixote say; matters chivalry all
 gentlemen bow authority.”
 
“by god, gentlemen,” said don quixote, “so many strange things have
 happened castle two occasions have
 sojourned it, will venture assert anything positively
 reply question touching anything contains; my
 belief everything goes within goes enchantment. the
 first time, enchanted moor gave sore trouble,
 sancho fare well among certain followers his; last night
 kept hanging arm nearly two hours, without knowing
 came mishap. now, come forward
 give opinion puzzling matter, risk rash
 decision. regards assertion basin a
 helmet already given answer; question whether
 pack-saddle caparison will venture give a
 positive opinion, will leave worships’ better judgment.
 perhaps dubbed knights like myself, enchantments of
 place nothing you, faculties are
 unfettered, can see things castle really and
 truly are, appear me.”
 
“there can question,” said don fernando this, “but señor
 don quixote spoken wisely, us rests decision
 matter; may surer ground go on, will take
 votes gentlemen secret, declare result clearly
 fully.”
 
secret don quixote’s humour this
 afforded great amusement; knew nothing it, it
 seemed greatest nonsense world, particular four
 servants don luis, well don luis himself, three
 travellers chance come inn, the
 appearance officers holy brotherhood, indeed were;
 one wits’ end barber whose
 basin, eyes, turned mambrino’s
 helmet, whose pack-saddle doubt whatever to
 become rich caparison horse. laughed see don fernando
 going one another collecting votes, whispering them
 give private opinion whether treasure there
 much fighting pack-saddle caparison; after
 taken votes knew don quixote, said aloud,
 “the fact is, good fellow, tired collecting number
 opinions, find one ask i
 desire know, tell absurd say this
 pack-saddle ass, caparison horse, nay, of
 thoroughbred horse; must submit, for, spite your
 ass, caparison pack-saddle, stated and
 proved case badly.”
 
“may never share heaven,” said poor barber, “if worships are
 mistaken; may soul appear god appears to
 pack-saddle caparison; but, ‘laws go,’—i say more;
 indeed drunk, fasting, except sin.”
 
simple talk barber afford less amusement the
 absurdities don quixote, now observed:
 
“there done now take belongs to
 him, god given it, may st. peter add blessing.”
 
said one four servants, “unless, indeed, a
 deliberate joke, bring believe men so
 intelligent present are, seem be, can venture declare
 assert basin, pack-saddle; as
 perceive assert declare it, can come the
 conclusion mystery persistence so
 opposed evidence experience truth itself; swear
 by”—and rapped round oath—“all people world
 will make believe barber’s basin a
 jackass’s pack-saddle.”
 
“it might easily she-ass’s,” observed curate.
 
“it same,” said servant; “that point; but
 whether pack-saddle, worships say.”
 
hearing one newly arrived officers brotherhood,
 listening dispute controversy, unable to
 restrain anger impatience, exclaimed, “it pack-saddle as
 sure father father, whoever said will say
 anything else must drunk.”
 
“you lie like rascally clown,” returned don quixote; lifting his
 pike, never let hand, delivered blow
 head that, officer dodged it, have
 stretched full length. pike shivered pieces against
 ground, rest officers, seeing comrade
 assaulted, raised shout, calling help holy brotherhood.
 landlord, fraternity, ran fetch staff
 office sword, ranged side his
 comrades; servants don luis clustered round him, lest should
 escape confusion; barber, seeing house turned
 upside down, laid hold pack-saddle sancho the
 same; don quixote drew sword charged officers; don luis
 cried servants leave alone go help don
 quixote, cardenio don fernando, supporting him; the
 curate shouting top voice, landlady was
 screaming, daughter wailing, maritornes weeping, dorothea
 aghast, luscinda terror-stricken, doña clara faint. the
 barber cudgelled sancho, sancho pommelled barber; don luis gave
 one servants, ventured catch arm keep him
 escaping, cuff bathed teeth blood; judge took
 part; don fernando got one officers was
 belabouring heartily; landlord raised voice calling
 help holy brotherhood; whole inn nothing
 cries, shouts, shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps,
 sword-cuts, fisticuffs, cudgellings, kicks, bloodshed; the
 midst chaos, complication, general entanglement, don
 quixote took head plunged thick
 discord agramante’s camp; and, voice shook inn
 like thunder, cried out:
 
“hold all, let sheathe swords, let calm attend to
 value lives!”
 
paused mighty voice, went say, “did tell
 you, sirs, castle enchanted, legion of
 devils dwelt it? proof whereof call upon behold with
 eyes discord agramante’s camp come hither, and
 transferred midst us. see fight, for
 sword, horse, side eagle, for
 helmet; fighting, cross purposes. come then,
 you, señor judge, you, señor curate; let one represent king
 agramante king sobrino, make peace among us; by
 god almighty sorry business many persons quality as
 slay one another trifling cause.” officers,
 understand don quixote’s mode speaking, found
 roughly handled don fernando, cardenio, their
 companions, appeased; barber was, however, both
 beard pack-saddle worse struggle; sancho
 like good servant obeyed slightest word master; the
 four servants don luis kept quiet saw little they
 gained so. landlord alone insisted upon they
 must punish insolence madman, every turn raised a
 disturbance inn; length uproar stilled the
 present; pack-saddle remained caparison till day judgment,
 basin helmet inn castle don quixote’s
 imagination.
 
now pacified made friends persuasion the
 judge curate, servants don luis began urge him
 return once; discussing matter
 them, judge took counsel don fernando, cardenio, the
 curate case, telling it
 stood, don luis said him. agreed length that
 don fernando tell servants don luis was, that
 desire don luis accompany andalusia,
 receive marquis brother welcome his
 quality entitled to; for, otherwise, easy see the
 determination don luis return father at
 present, though tore pieces. learning rank don
 fernando resolution don luis four settled it
 three return tell father
 matters stood, remain wait upon don
 luis, leave came back him, father’s
 orders known. thus authority agramante wisdom of
 king sobrino complication disputes arranged; the
 enemy concord hater peace, feeling slighted made
 fool of, seeing little gained involved
 elaborate entanglement, resolved try hand
 stirring fresh quarrels disturbances.
 
came wise: officers pacified learning the
 rank engaged, withdrew the
 contest, considering whatever result might likely
 get worst battle; one them, one been
 thrashed kicked don fernando, recollected among some
 warrants carried arrest certain delinquents, one
 don quixote, holy brotherhood ordered be
 arrested setting galley slaves free, sancho had, very
 good reason, apprehended. suspecting was, then, wished to
 satisfy whether don quixote’s features corresponded; and
 taking parchment bosom lit upon search
 of, setting read deliberately, quick
 reader, made word fixed eyes don quixote, and
 went comparing description warrant face, and
 discovered beyond doubt person described it. as
 soon satisfied himself, folding parchment, took the
 warrant left hand right seized don quixote the
 collar tightly allow breathe, shouted
 aloud, “help holy brotherhood! may see demand it
 earnest, read warrant says highwayman be
 arrested.”
 
curate took warrant saw officer said was
 true, agreed don quixote’s appearance, who, his
 part, found roughly handled rascally clown,
 worked highest pitch wrath, joints cracking
 rage, hands seized officer throat all
 might, helped comrades have
 yielded life ere don quixote released hold. landlord,
 perforce support brother officers, ran aid
 them. landlady, saw husband engaged fresh
 quarrel, lifted voice afresh, note immediately
 caught maritornes daughter, calling upon heaven all
 present help; sancho, seeing going on, exclaimed, “by
 lord, quite true master says enchantments
 castle, impossible live hour peace it!”
 
don fernando parted officer don quixote, mutual
 contentment made relax grip held, one the
 coat collar, throat adversary; this,
 however, officers cease demand prisoner call
 help, deliver bound power, was
 required service king holy brotherhood, on

don quixote talking strain, curate was
 endeavouring persuade officers senses, as
 might perceive deeds words, need not
 press matter further, even arrested carried
 off, release by-and-by madman; which
 holder warrant replied nothing with
 inquiring don quixote’s madness, execute his
 superior’s orders, taken might let go three
 hundred times liked.
 
“for that,” said curate, “you must take away time,
 will he, opinion, let taken away.”
 
short, curate used arguments, don quixote mad
 things, officers mad they
 perceived want wits, thought best to
 allow pacified, even act peacemakers between
 barber sancho panza, still continued altercation with
 much bitterness. end they, officers justice, settled the
 question arbitration manner sides were, not
 perfectly contented, least extent satisfied; they
 changed pack-saddles, girths head-stalls; to
 mambrino’s helmet, curate, rose without don quixote’s
 knowing it, paid eight reals basin, barber executed a
 full receipt engagement make demand or
 thenceforth evermore, amen. two disputes, most
 important gravest, settled, remained servants
 don luis consent three return one was
 left accompany whither don fernando desired take him; and
 good luck better fortune, already begun solve
 difficulties remove obstructions favour lovers and
 warriors inn, pleased persevere bring everything to
 happy issue; servants agreed don luis wished; which
 gave doña clara happiness one looked her
 face just without seeing joy heart. zoraida, though she
 fully comprehend saw, grave gay without knowing
 why, watched studied various countenances, but
 particularly spaniard’s, followed eyes clung
 soul. gift compensation curate gave the
 barber escaped landlord’s notice, demanded don
 quixote’s reckoning, together amount damage his
 wine-skins, loss wine, swearing neither rocinante
 sancho’s ass leave inn paid the
 last farthing. curate settled amicably, don fernando
 paid; though judge also readily offered pay score;
 became peaceful quiet inn longer reminded
 one discord agramante’s camp, don quixote said, the
 peace tranquillity days octavianus: was
 universal opinion thanks due great zeal and
 eloquence curate, unexampled generosity don
 fernando.
 
finding now clear quit quarrels, squire’s as
 well own, don quixote considered advisable to
 continue journey begun, bring close great
 adventure called chosen; high
 resolve went knelt dorothea, who, however, not
 allow utter word risen; obey rose,
 said, “it common proverb, fair lady, ‘diligence the
 mother good fortune,’ experience often shown important
 affairs earnestness negotiator brings doubtful case
 successful termination; nothing truth show itself
 plainly war, quickness activity forestall the
 devices enemy, win victory foe time to
 defend himself. say, exalted esteemed lady, it
 seems us remain longer castle now is
 useless, may injurious us way shall find out
 day; knows enemy giant may learned
 means secret diligent spies going destroy him,
 opportunity given may seize fortify himself
 impregnable castle stronghold, efforts
 might indefatigable arm may avail little? therefore,
 lady, let us, say, forestall schemes activity, let
 us depart quest fair fortune; highness only
 kept enjoying fully desire delay in
 encountering adversary.”
 
don quixote held peace said more, calmly awaiting reply
 beauteous princess, who, commanding dignity style
 adapted don quixote’s own, replied words, “i give
 thanks, sir knight, eagerness you, like good knight to
 natural obligation succour orphan needy,
 display afford aid sore trouble; heaven grant your
 wishes mine may realised, may see are
 women world capable gratitude; departure, let be
 forthwith, will yours; dispose entirely in
 accordance good pleasure; entrusted to
 defence person, placed hands recovery of
 dominions, must think offering opposition your
 wisdom may ordain.”
 
“on, then, god’s name,” said don quixote; “for, lady humbles
 me, will lose opportunity raising and
 placing throne ancestors. let us depart once, for
 common saying delay danger, lends spurs my
 eagerness take road; neither heaven created hell
 seen can daunt intimidate me, saddle rocinante, sancho, and
 get ready thy ass queen’s palfrey, let us take leave the
 castellan gentlemen, go hence instant.”
 
sancho, standing time, said, shaking head, “ah!
 master, master, mischief village one hears
 of, begging good bodies’ pardon.”
 
“what mischief can village, cities the
 world, booby, can hurt reputation?” said don quixote.
 
“if worship angry,” replied sancho, “i will hold tongue and
 leave unsaid good squire bound say, good
 servant tell master.”
 
“say thou wilt,” returned don quixote, “provided thy words not
 meant work upon fears; thou, thou fearest, art behaving
 like thyself; like myself, fearing.”
 
“it nothing sort, sinner god,” said sancho,
 “but take sure certain lady, calls
 queen great kingdom micomicon, my
 mother; for, says, go rubbing noses
 one every instant behind every door.”
 
dorothea turned red sancho’s words, truth her
 husband don fernando now then, others not
 looking, gathered lips reward love earned,
 sancho seeing considered freedom like a
 courtesan queen great kingdom; she, however, unable
 caring answer him, allowed proceed, continued,
 “this say, señor, because, travelled roads and
 highways, passed bad nights worse days, one now enjoying
 inn reap fruit labours, no
 need hurry saddle rocinante, put pad the
 ass, get ready palfrey; will better us stay
 quiet, let every jade mind spinning, let us go dinner.”
 
good god, indignation don quixote heard the
 audacious words squire! great it, voice
 inarticulate rage, stammering tongue, eyes flashed
 living fire, exclaimed, “rascally clown, boorish, insolent, and
 ignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter slanderer!
 hast thou dared utter words presence these
 illustrious ladies? hast thou dared harbour gross shameless
 thoughts thy muddled imagination? begone presence, thou born
 monster, storehouse lies, hoard untruths, garner knaveries,
 inventor scandals, publisher absurdities, enemy respect
 due royal personages! begone, show thyself under
 pain wrath;” saying knitted brows, puffed his
 cheeks, gazed around him, stamped ground violently his
 right foot, showing every way rage pent his
 heart; words furious gestures sancho scared and
 terrified glad earth opened that
 instant swallowed him, thought turn round and
 make escape angry presence master.
 
ready-witted dorothea, time well understood don
 quixote’s humour, said, mollify wrath, “be irritated the
 absurdities good squire uttered, sir knight rueful
 countenance, perhaps utter without cause, from
 good sense christian conscience likely would
 bear false witness anyone. may therefore believe, without
 hesitation, since, say, sir knight, everything this
 castle goes brought means enchantment, sancho, i
 say, may possibly seen, diabolical medium, he
 says saw much detriment modesty.”
 
“i swear god omnipotent,” exclaimed don quixote this, “your
 highness hit point; vile illusion must come
 sinner sancho, made see have
 impossible see means enchantments; know
 well enough, poor fellow’s goodness harmlessness, he
 incapable bearing false witness anybody.”
 
“true, doubt,” said don fernando, “for reason, señor don
 quixote, forgive restore bosom your
 favour, _sicut erat principio_, illusions sort had
 taken away senses.”
 
don quixote said ready pardon him, curate went for
 sancho, came humbly, falling knees begged for
 hand master, presented allowed him
 kiss it, gave blessing said, “now, sancho son, thou
 wilt convinced truth many time told thee,
 everything castle done means enchantment.”
 
“so is, believe,” said sancho, “except affair blanket,
 came pass reality ordinary means.”
 
“believe not,” said don quixote, “for so, have
 avenged thee instant, even now; neither now could
 i, seen anyone upon avenge thy wrong.”
 
eager know affair blanket was, the
 landlord gave minute account sancho’s flights, they
 laughed little, sancho less out
 countenance master assured all
 enchantment. simplicity never reached high pitch
 persuade plain simple truth,
 without deception whatever it, blanketed by
 beings flesh blood, visionary imaginary phantoms,
 master believed protested.
 
illustrious company now two days inn; it
 seemed time depart, devised plan that, without
 giving dorothea don fernando trouble going back don
 quixote village pretence restoring queen micomicona,
 curate barber might carry away they
 proposed, curate able take madness hand home;
 pursuance plan arranged owner an
 oxcart happened passing way carry this
 fashion. constructed kind cage wooden bars, large enough
 hold don quixote comfortably; don fernando his
 companions, servants don luis, officers the
 brotherhood, together landlord, directions advice
 curate, covered faces disguised themselves, in
 one way, another, appear don quixote quite
 different persons seen castle. done, in
 profound silence entered room asleep, taking his
 rest past frays, advancing sleeping
 tranquilly, dreaming anything kind happening, seized
 firmly bound fast hand foot, that, awoke
 startled, unable move, marvel wonder at
 strange figures saw him; upon gave way
 idea crazed fancy invariably conjured him,
 took head shapes phantoms the
 enchanted castle, unquestionably enchanted as
 neither move help himself; precisely curate, the
 concoctor scheme, expected happen. there
 sancho one senses own
 proper character, he, though within little sharing
 master’s infirmity, fail perceive these
 disguised figures were; dare open lips he
 saw came assault capture master; the
 latter utter word, waiting upshot mishap; was
 bringing cage, shut nailed bars
 firmly easily burst open.

took shoulders, passed the
 room awful voice—as much barber, pack-saddle
 other, able make it—was heard say, “o knight the
 rueful countenance, let captivity thou art placed

 accomplishment adventure thy great heart engaged
 thee; shall accomplished raging manchegan lion
 white tobosan dove shall linked together, first
 humbled haughty necks gentle yoke matrimony. from
 marvellous union shall come forth light world brave
 whelps shall rival ravening claws valiant father; and

 noble obedient squire ever bore sword side, beard on

 flower knight-errantry carried away thus thy eyes; for
 soon, please framer universe, thou shalt see

 promises thy good master made thee shall prove false;

 wages shall paid thee, thou shalt see due season. follow then
 footsteps valiant enchanted knight, expedient that
 thou shouldst go destination assigned you; it
 permitted say more, god thee; return to
 place wot of;” brought prophecy close he
 raised voice high pitch, lowered soft
 tone, even knew joke almost inclined
 take heard seriously.
 
don quixote comforted prophecy heard, once
 comprehended meaning perfectly, perceived promised to
 see united holy lawful matrimony with
 beloved dulcinea toboso, whose blessed womb proceed
 whelps, sons, eternal glory mancha; being
 thoroughly firmly persuaded this, lifted voice, and
 deep sigh exclaimed, “oh thou, whoever thou art, hast
 foretold much good, implore thee part thou
 entreat sage enchanter takes charge interests, he
 leave perish captivity now carrying
 away, ere see fulfilled promises joyful incomparable as
 now made me; for, let come pass, and
 shall glory pains prison, find comfort chains
 wherewith bind me, regard bed whereon stretch me,

 touching consolation sancho panza, squire, rely upon his
 goodness rectitude will desert good evil
 fortune; if, ill luck mine, may happen my
 power give island promised, equivalent it,
 least wages shall lost; will, already
 made, declared sum shall paid him, measured, not
 many faithful services, means disposal.”
 
sancho bowed head respectfully kissed hands, for,
 tied together, kiss one; apparitions
 lifted cage upon shoulders fixed upon ox-cart.

“i don’t know think,” answered sancho, “not well read
 worship errant writings; venture say
 swear apparitions us quite
 catholic.”
 
“catholic!” said don quixote. “father me! can catholic
 devils taken fantastic shapes come and
 this, bring condition? thou wouldst prove it,
 touch them, feel them, thou wilt find bodies of
 air, consistency except appearance.”
 
“by god, master,” returned sancho, “i touched already; and
 devil, goes busily, firm flesh, and
 another property different heard say devils have,
 accounts smell brimstone bad smells;
 one smells amber half league off.” sancho here
 speaking don fernando, who, like gentleman rank, very
 likely perfumed sancho said.
 
“marvel that, sancho friend,” said don quixote; “for let me
 tell thee devils crafty; even carry odours about
 them, smell, spirits; or,
 smell, smell anything sweet, of
 something foul fetid; reason carry hell
 wherever go, can get ease whatever their
 torments, sweet smell thing gives pleasure and
 enjoyment, impossible can smell sweet; if, then, this
 devil thou speakest seems thee smell amber, either thou art
 deceiving thyself, wants deceive thee making thee fancy he
 devil.”
 
conversation passed master man; don
 fernando cardenio, apprehensive sancho’s making complete
 discovery scheme, towards already gone way,
 resolved hasten departure, calling landlord aside,
 directed saddle rocinante put pack-saddle on
 sancho’s ass, great alacrity. meantime the
 curate made arrangement officers bear
 company far village, paying much day.
 cardenio hung buckler one side bow rocinante’s saddle
 basin other, signs commanded sancho mount his
 ass take rocinante’s bridle, side cart placed
 two officers muskets; cart put motion,
 came landlady daughter maritornes bid don
 quixote farewell, pretending weep grief misfortune; and
 don quixote said:
 
“weep not, good ladies, mishaps lot who
 follow profession profess; reverses befall
 esteem famous knight-errant; things
 never happen knights little renown fame, nobody in
 world thinks them; valiant knights do, are
 envied virtue valour many princes knights
 compass destruction worthy base means. nevertheless,
 virtue mighty, that, spite magic that
 zoroaster first inventor knew, will come victorious of
 every trial, shed light upon earth sun upon the
 heavens. forgive me, fair ladies, if, inadvertence, in
 aught offended you; intentionally wittingly never done
 any; pray god deliver captivity to
 malevolent enchanter consigned me; find
 released therefrom, favours ye bestowed upon in
 castle shall held memory me, may acknowledge,
 recognise, requite deserve.”
 
passing ladies castle don
 quixote, curate barber bade farewell don fernando and
 companions, captain, brother, ladies, now all
 made happy, particular dorothea luscinda. all
 embraced one another, promised let know things
 went them, don fernando directed curate write to
 him, tell became don quixote, assuring there
 nothing give pleasure hear it, and
 too, part, send word everything thought
 like know, marriage, zoraida’s baptism, don
 luis’s affair, luscinda’s return home. curate promised
 comply request carefully, embraced more, and
 renewed promises.
 
landlord approached curate handed papers, saying
 discovered lining valise novel
 “the ill-advised curiosity” found, might take
 away owner since returned; for, as
 read, want himself. curate thanked
 him, opening saw beginning manuscript the
 words, “novel rinconete cortadillo,” perceived that
 novel, “the ill-advised curiosity” been
 good concluded too, probably by
 author; kept it, intending read an
 opportunity. mounted friend barber same,
 masked, recognised don quixote, set out
 following rear cart. order march this: first
 went cart owner leading it; side marched the
 officers brotherhood, said, muskets; then
 followed sancho panza ass, leading rocinante bridle; and
 behind came curate barber mighty mules, with
 faces covered, aforesaid, grave serious air, measuring
 pace suit slow steps oxen. don quixote seated
 cage, hands tied feet stretched out, leaning
 bars silent patient stone statue
 man flesh. thus slowly silently made, might
 be, two leagues, reached valley carter thought a
 convenient place resting feeding oxen, said to
 curate, barber opinion push a
 little farther, side hill appeared close by
 knew valley grass much better the
 one proposed halt; advice taken they
 continued journey.
 
just moment curate, looking back, saw coming behind them
 six seven mounted men, well found equipped, soon overtook
 them, travelling, sluggish, deliberate pace of
 oxen, like men rode canons’ mules, haste take their
 noontide rest soon possible inn sight a
 league off. quick travellers came slow, courteous
 salutations exchanged; one new comers, was, in
 fact, canon toledo master others accompanied him,
 observing regular order procession, cart, officers,
 sancho, rocinante, curate barber, don quixote
 caged confined, help asking meaning of
 carrying man fashion; though, badges the
 officers, already concluded must desperate
 highwayman malefactor whose punishment fell within the
 jurisdiction holy brotherhood. one officers he
 put question, replied, “let gentleman tell the
 meaning going way, señor, know.”
 
don quixote overheard conversation said, “haply, gentlemen, you
 versed learned matters errant chivalry? you
 will tell misfortunes; not, good my
 giving trouble relating them;” curate and
 barber, seeing travellers engaged conversation
 don quixote, came forward, order answer way to
 save stratagem discovered.
 
canon, replying don quixote, said, “in truth, brother, know
 books chivalry villalpando’s elements of
 logic; all, may safely tell please.”
 
“in god’s name, then, señor,” replied don quixote; “if so, i
 know held enchanted cage envy
 fraud wicked enchanters; virtue persecuted the
 wicked loved good. knight-errant, one of
 whose names fame never thought immortalising her

 immortality, serve examples patterns ages come,
 whereby knights-errant may see footsteps must tread
 attain summit crowning point honour arms.”
 
“what señor don quixote mancha says,” observed curate, “is
 truth; goes enchanted cart, fault or
 sins his, malevolence virtue is
 odious valour hateful. this, señor, knight rueful
 countenance, ever heard named, whose valiant
 achievements mighty deeds shall written lasting brass and
 imperishable marble, notwithstanding efforts envy obscure
 malice hide them.”
 
canon heard prisoner man liberty
 talk strain ready cross his
 astonishment, make befallen him; his
 attendants state amazement.
 
point sancho panza, drawn near hear the
 conversation, said, order make everything plain, “well, sirs, you
 may like dislike going say, fact matter
 is, master, don quixote, just much enchanted mother. he
 full senses, eats drinks, calls like

 case, mean wanting believe is

 exclaimed, “ah, señor curate, señor curate! think don’t know

“trim lamps there!” exclaimed barber this; “so of

“i child anyone,” returned sancho, “nor man to

barber care answer sancho lest plain speaking he
 disclose curate trying hard to

 canon agreed, going ahead servants, listened with
 attention account character, life, madness, ways of
 don quixote, given curate, described briefly the
 beginning origin craze, told whole story his
 adventures confined cage, together plan
 taking home try means discover
 cure madness. canon servants surprised anew
 heard don quixote’s strange story, finished
 said, “to tell truth, señor curate, part consider what

curate listened attentively felt man of

 told that, opinion himself, bearing a
 grudge books chivalry, burned don quixote’s, which

“it say, señor canon,” said curate; “and reason
 hitherto written books sort deserve more
 censure writing without paying attention good taste the
 rules art, might guide become famous
 prose two princes greek latin poetry verse.”
 
“i myself, rate,” said canon, “was tempted write a
 book chivalry points mentioned be
 observed; must truth hundred sheets
 written; try came opinion it, showed
 persons fond kind reading, learned and
 intelligent men well ignorant people cared nothing but
 pleasure listening nonsense, obtained
 flattering approval; nevertheless proceeded farther it, as
 well seemed occupation inconsistent my
 profession, perceived fools numerous
 wise; and, though better praised wise few
 applauded foolish many, mind submit to
 stupid judgment silly public, reading such
 books falls part.
 
“but made hold hand even abandon idea of
 finishing argument put taken plays that
 acted now-a-days, wise: now in
 vogue, well pure invention founded on
 history, are, them, downright nonsense things that
 neither head tail, yet public listens with
 delight, regards cries perfection so
 far it; authors write them, players act
 them, say must be, public wants and
 will nothing else; go rule work a
 plot according laws art will find half-dozen
 intelligent people understand them, rest remain blind
 merit composition; better
 get bread many praise few; book will
 fare way, burnt eyebrows trying to
 observe principles spoken of, shall ‘the tailor of
 corner.’ though sometimes endeavoured convince actors
 mistaken notion adopted, they
 attract people, get credit, producing plays in
 accordance rules art, absurd ones, so
 thoroughly wedded opinion argument evidence can
 wean it.
 
“i remember saying one day one obstinate fellows, ‘tell me,
 recollect years ago, three tragedies
 acted spain, written famous poet kingdoms, were
 filled heard admiration, delight, and
 interest, ignorant well wise, masses well the
 higher orders, brought money performers, three

“‘no doubt,’ replied actor question, ‘you mean “isabella,”
 “phyllis,” “alexandra.”’
 
“‘those ones mean,’ said i; ‘and see observe

 nonsense, “the numantia,” be
 found “the merchant lover,” yet “the friendly fair foe,” nor
 others written certain gifted poets, their
 fame renown, profit brought out;’
 remarks added these, which, think, left him
 rather dumbfoundered, satisfied convinced could
 disabuse error.”
 
“you touched upon subject, señor canon,” observed curate
 here, “that awakened old enmity plays in
 vogue present day, quite strong bear the
 books chivalry; drama, according tully, be
 mirror human life, model manners, image the
 truth, presented now-a-days mirrors nonsense,
 models folly, images lewdness. greater nonsense can
 connection now discussing an
 infant appear swaddling clothes first scene first

 absurdity can putting us old man a

“what thou sayest true, sancho,” replied don quixote; “but have
 already told thee many sorts enchantments, may be

 now may way enchanted people do,
 though before; vain argue draw
 inferences usage time. know feel am

“i content thou sayest, brother sancho,” said don quixote,
 “and thou seest opportunity effecting release will
 obey thee absolutely; thou wilt see, sancho, mistaken thou art

knight-errant ill-errant squire kept conversation
 till reached place curate, canon, the
 barber, already dismounted, waiting them. carter
 unyoked oxen left roam large the
 pleasant green spot, freshness seemed invite, not
 enchanted people like don quixote, wide-awake, sensible folk like
 squire, begged curate allow master leave cage
 little; let out, prison might be
 clean propriety gentleman master required.
 curate understood him, said gladly comply with
 request, feared master, finding at
 liberty, take old courses make nobody could
 ever find again.
 
“i will answer running away,” said sancho.
 
“and also,” said canon, “especially gives word a
 knight leave us without consent.”
 
don quixote, listening this, said, “i give it;—moreover
 one enchanted likes himself; he
 enchanted prevent moving one place three
 ages, attempted escape bring back flying.”—and
 so, might well release him, particularly would
 advantage all; for, let out, he
 protested unable avoid offending nostrils unless
 kept distance.
 
canon took hand, tied together were, his
 word promise unbound him, rejoiced beyond measure was
 find cage. first thing stretch
 over, went rocinante standing and
 giving couple slaps haunches said, “i still trust in

 shall soon see ourselves, us, wish be, thou thy
 master thy back, mounted upon thee, following calling for

 sancho, withdrew retired spot, came back much
 relieved eager ever put squire’s scheme into
 execution.
 
canon gazed him, wondering extraordinary nature his
 madness, remarks replies show such
 excellent sense, lose stirrups, already said,
 subject chivalry broached. so, moved compassion,
 said him, sat green grass awaiting arrival
 provisions:
 
“is possible, gentle sir, nauseous idle reading of
 books chivalry can effect worship to
 upset reason fancy enchanted, like,
 far truth falsehood is? can any
 human understanding can persuade ever that
 infinity amadises world, multitude famous
 knights, emperors trebizond, felixmartes of
 hircania, palfreys, damsels-errant, serpents, and
 monsters, giants, marvellous adventures, enchantments of
 every kind, battles, prodigious encounters, splendid costumes,
 love-sick princesses, squires made counts, droll dwarfs, love letters,
 billings cooings, swashbuckler women, and, word, that
 nonsense books chivalry contain? myself, can say that
 read them, long stop think all
 lies frivolity, give certain amount pleasure; when
 come consider are, fling best the
 wall, fling fire one hand, as
 richly deserving punishment cheats impostors the
 range ordinary toleration, founders new sects modes of
 life, teachers lead ignorant public believe accept
 truth folly contain. audacity, they
 even dare unsettle wits gentlemen birth intelligence,
 shown plainly way served worship, they
 brought pass shut cage
 carried ox-cart one carry lion tiger from
 place place make money showing it. come, señor don quixote,
 compassion yourself, return bosom common sense,
 make use liberal share heaven pleased to
 bestow upon you, employing abundant gifts mind other
 reading may serve benefit conscience add your
 honour. if, still led away natural bent, desire read
 books achievements chivalry, read book judges the
 holy scriptures, will find grand reality, deeds as
 true heroic. lusitania viriatus, rome cæsar,
 carthage hannibal, greece alexander, castile count fernan
 gonzalez, valencia cid, andalusia gonzalo fernandez, estremadura a
 diego garcía paredes, jerez garci perez vargas, toledo a
 garcilaso, seville don manuel leon, read whose valiant deeds
 will entertain instruct loftiest minds fill with
 delight wonder. here, señor don quixote, will reading worthy of
 sound understanding; will rise learned history,
 love virtue, strengthened goodness, improved manners,
 brave without rashness, prudent without cowardice; the
 honour god, advantage glory mancha, whence, i
 informed, worship derives birth.”
 
don quixote listened greatest attention canon’s words,
 found finished, regarding time,
 replied him:
 
“it appears me, gentle sir, worship’s discourse is
 intended persuade never knights-errant the
 world, books chivalry false, lying, mischievous
 useless state, done wrong reading them,
 worse believing them, still worse imitating them, i
 undertook follow arduous calling knight-errantry they
 set forth; deny ever amadises gaul of
 greece, knights books full.”
 
“it exactly state it,” said canon; don
 quixote returned, “you also went say books kind had
 done much harm, inasmuch upset senses, shut up
 cage, better reform change my
 studies, read truer books afford pleasure
 instruction.”
 
“just so,” said canon.
 
“well then,” returned don quixote, “to mind the
 one wits enchanted, ventured to
 utter blasphemies thing universally acknowledged and
 accepted true whoever denies it, do, deserves same
 punishment say inflict books irritate you
 read them. try persuade anybody amadis, all

 many achievements christian knights foreign
 realms, authentic true, that, repeat, denies
 must totally wanting reason good sense.”
 
canon amazed hear medley truth fiction don
 quixote uttered, see well acquainted everything
 relating belonging achievements knight-errantry; he
 said reply:
 
“i deny, señor don quixote, truth you
 say, especially regards spanish knights-errant; willing
 grant twelve peers france existed, not
 disposed believe things archbishop
 turpin relates them. truth matter were
 knights chosen kings france, called ‘peers’ they
 equal worth, rank prowess (at least not
 been), kind religious order like
 santiago calatrava present day, is
 assumed take valiant knights distinction and
 good birth; just say now knight st. john, of
 alcántara, used say knight twelve peers, because
 twelve equals chosen military order. a
 cid, well bernardo carpio, can doubt; that
 deeds people say did, hold doubtful. in
 matter pin count pierres speak of, and
 say near babieca’s saddle armoury, confess sin; am
 either stupid short-sighted, that, though seen the
 saddle, never able see pin, spite as
 big worship says is.”
 
“for there, without manner doubt,” said don
 quixote; “and token say inclosed sheath of
 cowhide keep rusting.”
 
“all may be,” replied canon; “but, orders have
 received, remember seeing it. however, granting there,
 reason bound believe stories those
 amadises multitude knights tell us about, nor
 reasonable man like worship, worthy, so
 many good qualities, endowed good understanding, should
 allow persuaded wild crazy things are
 written absurd books chivalry really true.”

“that bad philosophy thou art talking, sancho,” said canon;
 “but good deal said matter of

don quixote returned, “i know be
 said; guide example set great amadis of

 without scruples conscience, can make count sancho panza,
 one best squires ever knight-errant had.”
 
canon astonished methodical nonsense (if nonsense be

 lastly marvelled simplicity sancho, desired eagerly

goatherd’s tale gave great satisfaction hearers, the
 canon especially enjoyed it, remarked particular
 attention manner told, unlike the
 manner clownish goatherd like polished city
 wit; observed curate quite right saying
 woods bred men learning. offered services to
 eugenio showed liberal way don
 quixote, said him, “most assuredly, brother goatherd, found
 position attempt adventure, would, very
 instant, set behalf, rescue leandra that
 convent (where doubt kept will), spite the
 abbess might try prevent me, place your
 hands deal according will pleasure, observing,
 however, laws chivalry lay violence any
 kind offered damsel. trust god lord that
 might one malignant enchanter may prove great that
 power another better disposed may prove superior it, then
 promise support assistance, bound my
 profession, none give aid weak and
 needy.”
 
goatherd eyed him, noticing don quixote’s sorry appearance and
 looks, filled wonder, asked barber, next
 him, “señor, man makes figure talks such
 strain?”
 
“who be,” said barber, “but famous don quixote la
 mancha, undoer injustice, righter wrongs, protector
 damsels, terror giants, winner battles?”
 
“that,” said goatherd, “sounds like one reads books of
 knights-errant, say man does; though it
 belief either joking, else gentleman has
 empty lodgings head.”
 
“you great scoundrel,” said don quixote, “and are
 empty fool. fuller ever whoreson bitch that
 bore you;” passing words deeds, caught loaf that
 near sent full goatherd’s face, force
 flattened nose; goatherd, understand
 jokes, found roughly handled good earnest, paying
 respect carpet, tablecloth, diners, sprang upon don quixote,
 seizing throat hands doubt have
 throttled him, sancho panza instant come rescue,
 grasping shoulders flung table, smashing
 plates, breaking glasses, upsetting scattering everything on
 it. don quixote, finding free, strove get top the
 goatherd, who, face covered blood, soundly kicked by
 sancho, fours feeling one table-knives to
 take bloody revenge with. canon curate, however,
 prevented him, barber contrived got don quixote
 him, rained upon shower fisticuffs that
 poor knight’s face streamed blood freely own. the
 canon curate bursting laughter, officers were
 capering delight, one hissed as
 dogs worrying one another fight. sancho alone was
 frantic, free grasp one the
 canon’s servants, kept going master’s assistance.

last, all, exception two bruisers
 mauling other, high glee enjoyment, heard a
 trumpet sound note doleful made look the
 direction whence sound seemed come. one most
 excited hearing don quixote, though sorely his
 will goatherd, something pretty well
 pummelled, said him, “brother devil (for impossible that
 thou must one since thou hast might strength enough to
 overcome mine), ask thee agree truce one hour the
 solemn note yonder trumpet falls ears seems to
 summon new adventure.” goatherd, time
 tired pummelling pummelled, released once, don
 quixote rising feet turning eyes quarter where
 sound heard, suddenly saw coming slope hill
 several men clad white like penitents.
 
fact clouds year withheld moisture from
 earth, villages district organising
 processions, rogations, penances, imploring god open hands

 hard going procession holy hermitage was
 one side valley. don quixote saw strange garb of
 penitents, without reflecting often seen before, took
 head case adventure, fell to
 alone knight-errant engage it; more
 confirmed notion, idea image draped black
 illustrious lady villains and
 discourteous thieves carrying force. soon this
 occurred ran speed rocinante grazing at

 mounted rocinante, braced buckler arm, loud voice
 exclaimed stood by, “now, noble company, ye shall see how
 important knights world professing
 order knight-errantry; now, say, ye shall see, the
 deliverance worthy lady borne captive there, whether
 knights-errant deserve held estimation,” saying he
 brought legs bear rocinante—for spurs—and full
 canter (for veracious history never read rocinante
 fairly galloping) set encounter penitents, though the
 curate, canon, barber ran prevent him. of
 power, even stop shouts sancho calling
 him, “where going, señor don quixote? devils have
 possessed set catholic faith? plague take me!
 mind, procession penitents, lady carrying
 stand blessed image immaculate virgin. take
 care doing, señor, time may safely said you
 don’t know about.” sancho laboured vain, master
 bent coming quarters sheeted figures and
 releasing lady black hear word; even had
 heard, turned back king ordered him. he
 came procession reined rocinante, already
 anxious enough slacken speed little, hoarse, excited
 voice exclaimed, “you hide faces, perhaps are
 good subjects, pay attention listen say
 you.” first halt carrying image, and
 one four ecclesiastics chanting litany, struck by
 strange figure don quixote, leanness rocinante, the
 ludicrous peculiarities observed, said reply him,
 “brother, anything say us say quickly, these
 brethren whipping themselves, stop, it
 reasonable stop hear anything, unless indeed short
 enough said two words.”
 
“i will say one,” replied don quixote, “and this; at
 once, instant, ye release fair lady whose tears sad
 aspect show plainly ye carrying will, and
 ye committed scandalous outrage her; i, who
 born world redress like wrongs, will not
 permit advance another step restored the
 liberty pines deserves.”
 
words hearers concluded must madman,
 began laugh heartily, laughter acted like gunpowder on
 don quixote’s fury, drawing sword without another word made
 rush stand. one supported it, leaving burden
 comrades, advanced meet him, flourishing forked stick that
 propping stand resting, caught
 mighty cut don quixote made severed two; with
 portion remained hand dealt thwack the
 shoulder don quixote’s sword arm (which buckler not
 protect clownish assault) poor don quixote came the
 ground sad plight.
 
sancho panza, coming close behind puffing blowing,
 seeing fall, cried assailant strike again,
 poor enchanted knight, never harmed anyone the
 days life; checked clown was, sancho’s
 shouting, seeing don quixote stir hand foot; and
 so, fancying killed him, hastily hitched tunic under
 girdle took heels across country like deer.
 
time don quixote’s companions come lay;
 processionists seeing come running, the
 officers brotherhood crossbows, apprehended mischief,
 clustering round image, raised hoods, grasped their
 scourges, priests tapers, awaited attack,
 resolved defend even take offensive against
 assailants could. fortune, however, arranged matter
 better expected, sancho fling on
 master’s body, raising doleful laughable
 lamentation ever heard, believed dead. the
 curate known another curate walked procession, and
 recognition one another set rest apprehensions both
 parties; first told two words don quixote
 was, whole troop penitents went see poor
 gentleman dead, heard sancho panza saying, tears his
 eyes, “oh flower chivalry, one blow stick hast ended
 course thy well-spent life! oh pride thy race, honour and
 glory mancha, nay, world, want thee
 will full evil-doers, longer fear punishment their
 misdeeds! oh thou, generous alexanders, since only
 eight months service thou hast given best island sea

cries moans sancho, don quixote came himself, the
 first word said was, “he lives separated you, sweetest
 dulcinea, greater miseries endure these. aid me, friend
 sancho, mount enchanted cart, condition to
 press saddle rocinante, shoulder knocked to
 pieces.”
 
“that will heart, señor,” said sancho; “and let us
 return village gentlemen, seek good, and
 will prepare making another sally, may turn more
 profitable creditable us.”
 
“thou art right, sancho,” returned don quixote; “it will wise let
 malign influence stars now prevails pass off.”
 
canon, curate, barber told act wisely
 said; so, highly amused sancho panza’s
 simplicities, placed don quixote cart before. the
 procession formed order proceeded road;
 goatherd took leave party; officers the
 brotherhood declined go farther, curate paid what
 due them; canon begged curate let know don
 quixote did, whether cured madness still suffered from
 it, begged leave continue journey; short, all
 separated went ways, leaving curate the

“thanks god,” said she, “for good me; now tell

“i glad that,” returned wife; “show things of

“what talking about, sancho, ladyships, islands, and
 vassals?” returned teresa panza—for sancho’s wife called, though

“don’t hurry know this, teresa,” said sancho; “it

cide hamete benengeli, second part history, third
 sally don quixote, says curate barber remained
 nearly month without seeing him, lest recall bring
 back recollection taken place. not, however,
 omit visit niece housekeeper, charge careful
 treat attention, give comforting things eat, and
 good heart brain, whence, plain to
 see, misfortune proceeded. niece housekeeper replied
 so, meant possible care and
 assiduity, perceive master now then
 beginning show signs right mind. gave great
 satisfaction curate barber, concluded had
 taken right course carrying enchanted ox-cart, as
 described first part great well accurate
 history, last chapter thereof. resolved pay a
 visit test improvement condition, although thought
 almost impossible any; agreed to
 touch upon point connected knight-errantry run
 risk reopening wounds still tender.
 
came see consequently, found sitting bed a
 green baize waistcoat red toledo cap, withered dried
 looked turned mummy. very
 cordially received him; asked health, he
 talked naturally well-chosen
 language. course conversation fell discussing
 call state-craft systems government, correcting this
 abuse condemning that, reforming one practice abolishing
 another, three setting new legislator, modern
 lycurgus, brand-new solon; completely remodel the
 state, seemed thrust furnace taken out
 something quite different put in; the
 subjects dealt with, don quixote spoke good sense that
 pair examiners fully convinced quite recovered
 full senses.
 
niece housekeeper present conversation could
 find words enough express thanks god seeing their
 master clear mind; curate, however, changing original
 plan, avoid touching upon matters chivalry, resolved to
 test don quixote’s recovery thoroughly, see whether genuine
 not; so, one subject another, came last talk of
 news come capital, and, among things, he
 said considered certain turk coming a
 powerful fleet, one knew purpose was, the
 great storm burst; christendom apprehension
 this, almost every year calls us arms, majesty
 made provision security coasts naples sicily
 island malta.
 
don quixote replied, “his majesty acted like prudent
 warrior providing safety realms time, the
 enemy may find unprepared; advice taken would
 recommend adopt measure present, doubt, his
 majesty far thinking of.”
 
moment curate heard said himself, “god keep thee in
 hand, poor don quixote, seems thou art precipitating
 thyself height thy madness profound abyss thy
 simplicity.”
 
barber, suspicion curate, asked don
 quixote advice measures said ought
 adopted; perhaps might prove one to
 added list many impertinent suggestions people
 habit offering princes.
 
“mine, master shaver,” said don quixote, “will impertinent, but,
 contrary, pertinent.”
 
“i don’t mean that,” said barber, “but experience shown
 expedients proposed majesty
 either impossible, absurd, injurious king the
 kingdom.”
 
“mine, however,” replied don quixote, “is neither impossible nor
 absurd, easiest, reasonable, readiest most
 expeditious suggest projector’s mind.”
 
“you take long time tell it, señor don quixote,” said curate.
 
“i don’t choose tell here, now,” said don quixote, “and it
 reach ears lords council to-morrow morning, some
 carry thanks rewards trouble.”
 
“for part,” said barber, “i give word god
 will repeat worship says, king, rook earthly
 man—an oath learned ballad curate, who, the
 prelude, told king thief robbed hundred
 gold crowns pacing mule.”
 
“i versed stories,” said don quixote; “but know oath is
 good one, know barber honest fellow.”
 
“even not,” said curate, “i will go bail answer for
 matter will silent dummy, pain of
 paying penalty may pronounced.”
 
“and will security you, señor curate?” said don quixote.
 
“my profession,” replied curate, “which keep secrets.”
 
“ods body!” said don quixote this, “what majesty do
 command, public proclamation, knights-errant are
 scattered spain assemble fixed day capital, for
 even half dozen come, may one among who
 alone will suffice destroy entire might turk. give me
 attention follow me. it, pray, new thing single
 knight-errant demolish army two hundred thousand men, if
 one throat made sugar paste? nay, tell me,
 many histories filled marvels? (in an
 evil hour me: don’t speak anyone else) famous don
 belianis alive now, anyone innumerable progeny amadis
 gaul! alive to-day, come face face
 turk, faith, give much turk’s
 chance. god will regard people, will provide
 someone, who, valiant knights-errant yore, least
 will inferior spirit; god knows mean, and
 say more.”
 
“alas!” exclaimed niece this, “may die master not
 want turn knight-errant again;” don quixote replied, “a
 knight-errant shall die, let turk come go he
 likes, strong force can, say, god knows
 mean.” barber said, “i ask worships give me
 leave tell short story something happened seville,
 comes pat purpose just now like greatly
 tell it.” don quixote gave leave, rest prepared to
 listen, began thus:
 
“in madhouse seville man relations had
 placed mind. graduate osuna in
 canon law; even salamanca, opinion of
 people mad same. graduate,
 years confinement, took head sane
 full senses, impression wrote the
 archbishop, entreating earnestly, correct language, to
 released misery living; god’s
 mercy now recovered lost reason, though relations, in
 order enjoy property, kept there, and, spite the
 truth, make mad dying day. the
 archbishop, moved repeated sensible, well-written letters, directed
 one chaplains make inquiry madhouse truth of
 licentiate’s statements, interview madman
 himself, and, appear senses, take
 restore liberty. chaplain so, the
 governor assured man still mad, though he
 often spoke like highly intelligent person, end break
 nonsense quantity quality counterbalanced the
 sensible things said before, might easily tested by
 talking him. chaplain resolved try experiment, and
 obtaining access madman conversed hour more,
 whole time never uttered word was
 incoherent absurd, but, contrary, spoke rationally that
 chaplain compelled believe sane. among other
 things, said governor him, lose presents
 relations made reporting still mad lucid
 intervals; worst foe misfortune his
 large property; order enjoy enemies disparaged and
 threw doubts upon mercy lord shown turning from
 brute beast man. short, spoke way cast
 suspicion governor, made relations appear covetous and
 heartless, rational chaplain determined take
 away archbishop might see him, ascertain for
 truth matter. yielding conviction, the
 worthy chaplain begged governor clothes the

“‘mind saying, licentiate; don’t let devil deceive

“‘i know cured,’ returned licentiate, ‘and shall not

“‘you cured!’ said madman; ‘well, shall see; god you;

“indeed, señor don quixote,” said barber, “i mean in
 way, and, help god, intention good, worship
 vexed.”
 
“as whether vexed not,” returned don quixote, “i
 best judge.”
 
hereupon curate observed, “i hardly said word yet; i
 gladly relieved doubt, arising don quixote has
 said, worries works conscience.”
 
“the señor curate leave that,” returned don quixote,
 “so may declare doubt, pleasant doubt on
 one’s conscience.”
 
“well then, permission,” said curate, “i say doubt is
 that, can do, persuade whole pack of
 knights-errant you, señor don quixote, mentioned, really and
 truly persons flesh blood, ever lived world; the
 contrary, suspect fiction, fable, falsehood, and
 dreams told men awakened sleep, rather still half asleep.”
 
“that another mistake,” replied don quixote, “into many have
 fallen believe ever knights the
 world, often, divers people divers occasions,
 tried expose almost universal error light truth.
 sometimes successful purpose, sometimes have,
 supporting upon shoulders truth; truth clear
 can almost say eyes seen amadis gaul, who

 depicted amadis, could, think, portray describe

 perception histories describe,
 deeds dispositions displayed, is
 possible, aid sound philosophy, deduce features,
 complexion, stature.”
 
“how big, worship’s opinion, may giant morgante been,
 señor don quixote?” asked barber.
 
“with regard giants,” replied don quixote, “opinions differ to
 whether ever world; holy
 scripture, err jot truth, shows us that
 were, gives us history big philistine,
 goliath, seven cubits half height, huge
 size. likewise, island sicily, found
 leg-bones arm-bones large size makes plain that
 owners giants, tall great towers; geometry puts
 fact beyond doubt. but, that, speak with
 certainty size morgante, though suspect have
 tall; inclined opinion find
 history deeds particularly mentioned, he
 frequently slept roof found houses contain him, it
 clear bulk anything excessive.”
 
“that true,” said curate, yielding enjoyment of
 hearing nonsense, asked notion features
 reinaldos montalban, don roland rest twelve
 peers france, knights-errant.
 
“as reinaldos,” replied don quixote, “i venture say was
 broad-faced, ruddy complexion, roguish somewhat prominent
 eyes, excessively punctilious touchy, given society of
 thieves scapegraces. regard roland, rotolando, or
 orlando (for histories call names), of
 opinion, hold, middle height, broad-shouldered,
 rather bow-legged, swarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, hairy body

 polite well-bred.”
 
“if roland graceful person worship has
 described,” said curate, “it wonder fair lady
 angelica rejected left gaiety, liveliness, and
 grace budding-bearded little moor surrendered
 herself; showed sense falling love gentle
 softness medoro rather roughness roland.”
 
“that angelica, señor curate,” returned don quixote, “was giddy
 damsel, flighty somewhat wanton, left world full of
 vagaries fame beauty. treated scorn a

“tell me, señor don quixote,” said barber here, “among those
 praised her, poet write satire lady
 angelica?”
 
“i can well believe,” replied don quixote, “that sacripante or
 roland poets given damsel trimming; for
 naturally way poets scorned rejected
 ladies, whether fictitious not, short they
 select ladies thoughts, avenge satires

“strange,” said curate; moment heard the
 housekeeper niece, previously withdrawn the
 conversation, exclaiming aloud courtyard, noise they
 ran out.

history relates outcry don quixote, curate, the
 barber heard came niece housekeeper exclaiming to
 sancho, striving force way see don quixote while
 held door him, “what vagabond want this
 house? own, brother, you, one else,
 delude master, lead astray, take tramping about
 country.”
 
sancho replied, “devil’s housekeeper! am
 deluded, led astray, taken tramping country, not
 thy master! carried world, mightily
 mistaken. enticed away home trick, promising an
 island, still waiting for.”
 
“may evil islands choke thee, thou detestable sancho,” said niece;
 “what islands? something eat, glutton gormandiser that
 thou art?”
 
“it something eat,” replied sancho, “but something govern
 rule, better four cities four judgeships court.”
 
“for that,” said housekeeper, “you don’t enter here, bag of
 mischief sack knavery; go govern house dig your
 seed-patch, give looking islands shylands.”
 
curate barber listened great amusement words of
 three; don quixote, uneasy lest sancho blab blurt
 whole heap mischievous stupidities, touch upon points that
 might altogether credit, called made other
 two hold tongues let come in. sancho entered, the
 curate barber took leave don quixote, whose
 recovery despaired saw wedded crazy
 ideas, saturated nonsense unlucky chivalry; and
 said curate barber, “you will see, gossip, are
 least thinking it, gentleman will another
 flight.”
 
“i doubt it,” returned barber; “but wonder so
 much madness knight simplicity squire,
 firm belief island, suppose
 exposures imagined get his
 head.”
 
“god help them,” said curate; “and let us look-out see
 comes absurdities knight squire, it
 seems cast mould, madness
 master without simplicity man worth a
 farthing.”
 
“that true,” said barber, “and like much know
 pair talking moment.”
 
“i promise you,” said curate, “the niece housekeeper will
 tell us by-and-by, ones forget listen.”
 
meanwhile don quixote shut room sancho, when
 alone said him, “it grieves greatly, sancho, that
 thou shouldst said, sayest, took thee thy
 cottage, thou knowest remain house. sallied
 forth together, took road together, wandered abroad together;
 fortune luck; blanketed thee
 once, belaboured hundred times, only
 advantage thee.”
 
“that reasonable,” replied sancho, “for, worship
 says, misfortunes belong properly knights-errant their
 squires.”
 
“thou art mistaken, sancho,” said don quixote, “according maxim
 _quando caput dolet_, etc.”
 
“i don’t understand language own,” said sancho.
 
“i mean say,” said don quixote, “that head suffers the
 members suffer; so, thy lord master, thy head, and
 thou part thou art servant; therefore evil that
 affects shall affect give thee pain, affects thee
 give pain me.”
 
“it so,” said sancho; “but blanketed member,
 head side wall, looking was
 flying air, feel pain whatever; the
 members obliged feel suffering head, be
 obliged feel sufferings.”
 
“dost thou mean say now, sancho,” said don quixote, “that not
 feel blanketing thee? thou dost, thou must say so
 think so, felt pain spirit thou didst in
 body. let us put aside present, shall have
 opportunities enough considering settling point; tell me,
 sancho friend, say village here? what
 common people think me? hidalgos? the
 caballeros? say valour; achievements; my
 courtesy? treat task undertaken reviving and
 restoring world now forgotten order chivalry? short,
 sancho, thee tell come thine ears on
 subject; thou art tell me, without adding anything the
 good taking away anything bad; duty loyal
 vassals tell truth lords just its
 proper shape, allowing flattery add idle deference
 lessen it. thee know, sancho, naked
 truth, undisguised flattery, came ears princes, times
 different, ages reckoned iron ages more
 ours, hold golden latter days. profit
 advice, sancho, report clearly faithfully the
 truth thou knowest touching demanded thee.”
 
“that will heart, master,” replied sancho, “provided
 worship will vexed say, wish say it
 nakedness, without putting clothes than
 came knowledge in.”
 
“i will vexed all,” returned don quixote; “thou mayest speak
 freely, sancho, without beating bush.”
 
“well then,” said he, “first all, tell common
 people consider worship mighty great madman, less a
 fool. hidalgos say that, keeping within bounds your
 quality gentleman, assumed ‘don,’ made knight of
 jump, four vine-stocks couple acres of
 land, never shirt back. caballeros say not
 want hidalgos setting opposition them, particularly
 squire hidalgos polish shoes darn black
 stockings green silk.”
 
“that,” said don quixote, “does apply me, always go well
 dressed never patched; ragged may be, ragged the
 wear tear arms time.”
 
“as worship’s valour, courtesy, accomplishments, task,
 variety opinions. say, ‘mad droll;’ others,
 ‘valiant unlucky;’ others, ‘courteous meddling,’ they
 go number things don’t leave whole bone
 either worship myself.”
 
“recollect, sancho,” said don quixote, “that wherever virtue exists in
 eminent degree persecuted. none famous men that
 lived escaped calumniated malice. julius cæsar, the
 boldest, wisest, bravest captains, charged being
 ambitious, particularly cleanly dress, pure his
 morals. alexander, whose deeds won name great, say
 somewhat drunkard. hercules, many
 labours, said lewd luxurious. don galaor, the
 brother amadis gaul, whispered was
 over-quarrelsome, brother lachrymose. that, o
 sancho, amongst calumnies good men, mine may let
 pass, since thou hast said.”
 
“that’s just is, body father!”
 
“is more, then?” asked don quixote.
 
“there’s tail skinned yet,” said sancho; “all far cakes
 fancy bread; worship wants know the
 calumnies bring you, will fetch one instant who
 can tell whole without missing atom; last night
 bartholomew carrasco, studying salamanca,
 came home made bachelor, went welcome
 him, told worship’s history already abroad books,
 title ingenious gentleman don quixote mancha; and
 says mention name sancho panza, the
 lady dulcinea toboso too, divers things happened us
 alone; crossed wonder the
 historian wrote known them.”
 
“i promise thee, sancho,” said don quixote, “the author history
 will sage enchanter; nothing choose to
 write hidden.”
 
“what!” said sancho, “a sage enchanter! why, bachelor samson
 carrasco (that name spoke of) says author the
 history called cide hamete berengena.”
 
“that moorish name,” said don quixote.
 
“may so,” replied sancho; “for heard say moors are
 mostly great lovers berengenas.”
 
“thou must mistaken surname ‘cide’—which means in
 arabic ‘lord’—sancho,” observed don quixote.
 
“very likely,” replied sancho, “but worship wishes fetch
 bachelor will go twinkling.”
 
“thou wilt great pleasure, friend,” said don quixote, “for
 thou hast told amazed me, shall eat morsel that
 will agree heard it.”
 
“then him,” said sancho; leaving master went in
 quest bachelor, returned short time, and, all
 three together, droll colloquy.

don quixote remained deep thought, waiting bachelor
 carrasco, hear put a
 book sancho said; persuade such
 history existence, blood enemies had
 slain yet dry blade sword, now wanted to
 make mighty achievements going print. for
 that, fancied sage, either friend enemy, might, by
 aid magic, given press; friend, order

 knight-errant; enemy, bring naught degrade them

 himself, achievements squires never recorded. if, however,
 fact history existence, must

 lofty, imposing, grand true. comforted himself
 somewhat, though made uncomfortable think author was
 moor, judging title “cide;” truth be
 looked moors, impostors, cheats, schemers.
 afraid might dealt love affairs some
 indecorous fashion, might tend discredit prejudice of
 purity lady dulcinea toboso; set
 forth fidelity respect always observed towards her,
 spurning queens, empresses, damsels sorts, keeping in
 check impetuosity natural impulses. absorbed wrapped up
 divers cogitations, found sancho and
 carrasco, don quixote received great courtesy.
 
bachelor, though called samson, great bodily size,
 great wag; sallow complexion, very
 sharp-witted, somewhere four-and-twenty years age, a
 round face, flat nose, large mouth, indications a
 mischievous disposition love fun jokes; he
 gave sample soon saw don quixote, falling knees
 saying, “let kiss mightiness’s hand, señor don
 quixote mancha, for, habit st. peter wear,
 though first four orders, worship one
 famous knights-errant ever been, will be, all
 world over. blessing cide hamete benengeli, written
 history great deeds, double blessing that
 connoisseur took trouble translated the
 arabic castilian vulgar tongue universal entertainment
 people!”
 
don quixote made rise, said, “so, then, true there
 history me, moor sage wrote it?”
 
“so true it, señor,” said samson, “that belief more
 twelve thousand volumes said history print very
 day. ask portugal, barcelona, valencia, been
 printed, moreover report printed at
 antwerp, persuaded will country language in
 will translation it.”
 
“one things,” observed don quixote, “that give
 pleasure virtuous eminent man find his
 lifetime print type, familiar people’s mouths good
 name; say good name, opposite, is
 death compared it.”
 
“if goes good name fame,” said bachelor, “your worship
 alone bears away palm knights-errant; moor in
 language, christian his, taken care set
 us gallantry, high courage encountering dangers,
 fortitude adversity, patience misfortunes well as
 wounds, purity continence platonic loves worship
 lady doña dulcinea toboso—”
 
“i never heard lady dulcinea called doña,” observed sancho here;
 “nothing lady dulcinea toboso; already the
 history wrong.”
 
“that objection importance,” replied carrasco.
 
“certainly not,” said don quixote; “but tell me, señor bachelor, what
 deeds mine made history?”
 
“on point,” replied bachelor, “opinions differ, tastes do;
 swear adventure windmills worship took to
 briareuses giants; others fulling mills; one
 cries description two armies afterwards took the
 appearance two droves sheep; another dead body its
 way buried segovia; third says liberation galley
 slaves best all, fourth nothing comes the
 affair benedictine giants, battle valiant
 biscayan.”
 
“tell me, señor bachelor,” said sancho point, “does the
 adventure yanguesans come in, good rocinante went
 hankering dainties?”
 
“the sage left nothing ink-bottle,” replied samson; “he
 tells sets everything, even capers worthy
 sancho cut blanket.”
 
“i cut capers blanket,” returned sancho; “in air did,
 liked.”
 
“there human history world, suppose,” said don quixote,
 “that ups downs, others deal with
 chivalry, can never entirely made prosperous
 adventures.”
 
“for that,” replied bachelor, “there read
 history say glad author left
 countless cudgellings inflicted señor don
 quixote various encounters.”
 
“that’s truth history comes in,” said sancho.
 
“at time might fairly passed silence,”
 observed don quixote; “for need recording events which
 change affect truth history, tend bring
 hero contempt. Æneas truth earnest so
 pious virgil represents him, ulysses wise homer describes
 him.”
 
“that true,” said samson; “but one thing write poet,
 another write historian; poet may describe sing things,
 were, been; historian has
 write down, been, were,
 without adding anything truth taking anything it.”
 
“well then,” said sancho, “if señor moor goes telling the
 truth, doubt among master’s drubbings mine found; for
 never took measure worship’s shoulders without doing
 whole body; right wonder that, for,
 master says, members must share pain the
 head.”
 
“you sly dog, sancho,” said don quixote; “i’ faith, no
 want memory choose remember.”
 
“if try forget thwacks gave me,” said sancho, “my
 weals let me, still fresh ribs.”
 
“hush, sancho,” said don quixote, “and don’t interrupt bachelor,
 entreat go tell said this
 history.”
 
“and me,” said sancho, “for say, too, one the
 principal presonages it.”
 
“personages, presonages, friend sancho,” said samson.
 
“what! another word-catcher!” said sancho; “if that’s way we
 shall make end lifetime.”
 
“may god shorten mine, sancho,” returned bachelor, “if not
 second person history, even would
 rather hear talk cleverest whole book; though there
 some, too, say showed over-credulous believing
 possibility government island offered you
 señor don quixote.”
 
“there still sunshine wall,” said don quixote; “and when
 sancho somewhat advanced life, experience that
 years bring, will fitter better qualified a
 governor present.”
 
“by god, master,” said sancho, “the island govern with
 years have, i’ll able govern years of
 methuselah; difficulty said island keeps distance
 somewhere, know where; want head in
 govern it.”
 
“leave god, sancho,” said don quixote, “for will and
 perhaps better think; leaf tree stirs god’s
 will.”
 
“that true,” said samson; “and god’s will, will not
 want thousand islands, much less one, sancho to
 govern.”
 
“i seen governors parts,” said sancho, “that to
 compared shoe-sole; called ‘your
 lordship’ served silver.”
 
“those governors islands,” observed samson, “but other
 governments easier kind: govern islands must least
 know grammar.”
 
“i manage gram well enough,” said sancho; “but mar i
 neither leaning liking, don’t know is; but
 leaving matter government god’s hands, send me
 wherever may service, may tell you, señor bachelor
 samson carrasco, pleased beyond measure author of
 history spoken way said
 gives offence; for, faith true squire, had
 said anything unbecoming old christian,
 am, deaf heard it.”
 
“that working miracles,” said samson.
 
“miracles miracles,” said sancho, “let everyone mind he
 speaks writes people, set random first
 thing comes head.”
 
“one faults find history,” said bachelor, “is
 author inserted novel called ‘the ill-advised
 curiosity;’ bad ill-told, place
 nothing history worship señor don
 quixote.”
 
“i will bet dog mixed cabbages baskets,”
 said sancho.
 
“then, say,” said don quixote, “the author history sage,
 ignorant chatterer, who, haphazard heedless way, set
 writing it, let turn might, just orbaneja, the
 painter Úbeda, used do, who, asked was
 painting, answered, ‘what may turn out.’ sometimes paint a
 cock fashion, unlike, write alongside
 gothic letters, ‘this cock;’ will my
 history, will require commentary make intelligible.”
 
“no fear that,” returned samson, “for plain is
 nothing puzzle over; children turn leaves, young
 people read it, grown men understand it, old folk praise it; in
 word, thumbed, read, got heart people all
 sorts, instant see lean hack, say, ‘there goes
 rocinante.’ given reading pages,
 lord’s ante-chamber ‘don
 quixote’ found; one takes another lays down; one
 pounces upon it, begs it. short, said history is
 delightful least injurious entertainment been
 hitherto seen, found whole even the
 semblance immodest word, thought than
 catholic.”
 
“to write way,” said don quixote, “would write
 truth, falsehood, historians recourse falsehood
 burned, like coin false money; know not
 led author recourse novels and
 irrelevant stories, much write mine; no
 doubt must gone proverb ‘with straw hay, &c.,’
 merely setting forth thoughts, sighs, tears, lofty
 purposes, enterprises, might made volume large, or
 larger works tostado make up. fact, the
 conclusion arrive at, señor bachelor, is, write histories, or
 books kind, need great judgment ripe
 understanding. give expression humour, write strain of
 graceful pleasantry, gift great geniuses. cleverest
 character comedy clown, make people take him
 fool, must one. history measure sacred thing,
 true, truth is, god is; but
 notwithstanding this, write fling books
 broadcast world fritters.”
 
“there book bad something good it,” said the
 bachelor.
 
“no doubt that,” replied don quixote; “but often happens that
 acquired attained well-deserved reputation by
 writings, lose entirely, damage degree, when
 give press.”
 
“the reason that,” said samson, “is, printed works are
 examined leisurely, faults easily seen; greater the
 fame writer, closely scrutinised. men famous
 genius, great poets, illustrious historians, always, or
 commonly, envied take particular delight and
 pleasure criticising writings others, without produced
 own.”
 
“that wonder,” said don quixote; “for many divines who
 good pulpit, excellent detecting defects or
 excesses preach.”
 
“all true, señor don quixote,” said carrasco; “but wish such
 fault-finders lenient less exacting, pay so
 much attention spots bright sun work grumble
 at; _aliquando bonus dormitat homerus_, remember how
 long remained awake shed light work little
 shade possible; perhaps may find fault with
 may moles, sometimes heighten beauty face bears
 them; say great risk prints book
 exposes himself, impossibilities greatest write
 one will satisfy please readers.”
 
“that treats must pleased few,” said don quixote.
 
“quite contrary,” said bachelor; “for, _stultorum infinitum
 est numerus_, innumerable relished said history;
 brought charge author’s memory, inasmuch as
 forgot say thief stole sancho’s dapple; is
 stated there, inferred set down, that
 stolen, little farther see sancho mounted the
 ass, without reappearance it. say, too, forgot
 state sancho hundred crowns found the
 valise sierra morena, never alludes again, and
 many glad know them, what
 spent on, one serious omissions work.”
 
“señor samson, humour now going accounts or
 explanations,” said sancho; “for there’s sinking stomach come
 me, unless doctor couple sups old stuff
 will put thorn santa lucia. home, my
 old woman waiting me; dinner i’ll come back, will
 answer world every question may choose ask, as
 well loss ass spending hundred
 crowns;” without another word waiting reply made off
 home.
 
don quixote begged entreated bachelor stay penance
 him. bachelor accepted invitation remained, couple
 young pigeons added ordinary fare, dinner talked
 chivalry, carrasco fell host’s humour, banquet came to
 end, took afternoon sleep, sancho returned, their
 conversation resumed.

“that easy matter,” said don quixote, “and new
 occurrence, thing happened sacripante siege of
 albracca; famous thief, brunello, contrivance, took his
 horse legs.”
 
“day came,” continued sancho, “and moment stirred stakes gave
 way fell ground mighty come down; looked about
 ass, see him; tears rushed eyes i
 raised lamentation that, author history not
 put in, may depend upon left good thing. some
 days after, know many, travelling ladyship the
 princess micomicona, saw ass, mounted upon him, dress
 gipsy, gines pasamonte, great rogue rascal
 master freed chain.”
 
“that mistake is,” replied samson; “it is, before
 ass turned up, author speaks sancho mounted on
 it.”
 
“i don’t know say that,” said sancho, “unless the
 historian made mistake, perhaps might blunder the
 printer’s.”
 
“no doubt that’s it,” said samson; “but became hundred
 crowns? vanish?”
 
sancho answered, “i spent good, wife’s,
 children’s, made wife bear so
 patiently wanderings highways byways, service of
 master, don quixote; time come back to
 house without rap without ass, poor
 look-out me; anyone wants know anything me,

 affair anyone’s whether took take, whether spent or
 spend; whacks given journeys were
 paid money, even valued four
 maravedis apiece, another hundred crowns pay half of
 them. let look try make white black, and
 black white; us god made him, aye, often worse.”
 
“i will take care,” said carrasco, “to impress upon author the
 history that, prints again, must forget worthy
 sancho said, will raise good span higher.”
 
“is anything else correct history, señor bachelor?”
 asked don quixote.
 
“no doubt is,” replied he; “but anything will the
 importance mentioned.”
 
“does author promise second part all?” said don quixote.
 
“he promise one,” replied samson; “but says found
 it, know got it; say whether will
 appear not; so, head, say second part
 ever good, others enough already written
 don quixote, thought will second part; though
 some, jovial rather saturnine, say, ‘let us more
 quixotades, let don quixote charge sancho chatter, matter
 may turn out, shall satisfied that.’”
 
“and author mean do?” said don quixote.
 
“what?” replied samson; “why, soon found history which
 now searching extraordinary diligence, will once
 give press, moved profit may accrue him
 thought praise.”
 
whereat sancho observed, “the author looks money profit, does
 he? will wonder succeeds, will hurry,
 hurry, him, like tailor easter eve; works done a
 hurry never finished perfectly be. let master
 moor, whatever is, pay attention doing, and
 master will give much grouting ready hand, way
 adventures accidents sorts, make one
 second part, hundred. good man fancies, doubt, are
 fast asleep straw here, let hold feet shod
 will see foot go lame on. say is, if
 master take advice, now afield, redressing
 outrages righting wrongs, use custom good
 knights-errant.”
 
sancho hardly uttered words neighing rocinante
 fell upon ears, neighing don quixote accepted happy
 omen, resolved make another sally three four days from
 time. announcing intention bachelor, asked his
 advice quarter commence expedition,
 bachelor replied opinion go the
 kingdom aragon, city saragossa, be
 certain solemn joustings festival st. george, he
 might win renown knights aragon, be
 winning knights world. commended very
 praiseworthy gallant resolution, admonished proceed with
 greater caution encountering dangers, life not
 belong him, need protect aid
 misfortunes.
 
“there’s is, abominate, señor samson,” said sancho
 here; “my master will attack hundred armed men greedy boy would
 half dozen melons. body world, señor bachelor! time
 attack time retreat, always ‘santiago,
 close spain!’ moreover, heard said (and think my
 master himself, remember rightly) mean valour lies
 extremes cowardice rashness; so, i
 don’t want fly without good reason, attack the
 odds make better not. but, things, warn master that
 take must condition to
 fighting, called upon anything
 except concerns keeping clean comfortable; will
 dance attendance readily; expect draw sword, even
 rascally churls hatchet hood, idle. don’t set
 fighting man, señor samson, best loyal
 squire ever served knight-errant; master don quixote, in
 consideration many faithful services, pleased give some
 island many worship says one may stumble parts,
 will take great favour; give me, i
 born like everyone else, man must live dependence on
 anyone except god; more, bread will taste well, and
 perhaps even better, without government governor;
 know governments devil may have
 prepared trip me, make lose footing fall and
 knock grinders out? sancho born sancho mean die. but
 that, heaven make fair offer island or
 something else kind, without much trouble without much risk,
 fool refuse it; say, too, ‘when they
 offer thee heifer, run halter; ‘when good luck comes to
 thee, take in.’”
 
“brother sancho,” said carrasco, “you spoken like professor;
 but, that, put trust god señor don quixote, for
 will give kingdom, say island.”
 
“it same, less,” replied sancho; “though
 can tell señor carrasco master throw kingdom he
 might give sack holes; felt pulse
 find sound enough rule kingdoms govern islands; and
 now told master much.”
 
“take care, sancho,” said samson; “honours change manners, perhaps
 find governor won’t know mother bore
 you.”
 
“that may hold good born ditches,” said
 sancho, “not fat old christian four fingers
 deep souls, have. nay, look disposition, is
 likely show ingratitude anyone?”
 
“god grant it,” said don quixote; “we shall see government
 comes; seem see already.”
 
begged bachelor, poet, favour of
 composing verses conveying farewell meant take
 lady dulcinea toboso, see letter name
 placed beginning line, that, end the
 verses, “dulcinea toboso” might read putting together the
 first letters. bachelor replied although one the
 famous poets spain, were, said, three half, he
 fail compose required verses; though saw great
 difficulty task, letters made name were
 seventeen; so, made four ballad stanzas four lines each, there
 letter over, made five, called
 decimas redondillas, three letters short; nevertheless he
 try drop letter well could, name
 “dulcinea toboso” might got four ballad stanzas.
 
“it must be, means other,” said don quixote, “for unless the
 name stands plain manifest, woman believe verses
 made her.”
 
agreed upon this, departure take place in
 three days time. don quixote charged bachelor keep it
 secret, especially curate master nicholas, his
 niece housekeeper, lest prevent execution of
 praiseworthy valiant purpose. carrasco promised all, then
 took leave, charging don quixote inform good evil
 fortunes whenever opportunity; thus bade other
 farewell, sancho went away make necessary preparations for
 expedition.

 panza speaks style unlike might expected from
 limited intelligence, says things subtle not
 think possible conceived them; however, desirous of
 task imposed upon him, unwilling leave it
 untranslated, therefore went say:
 
sancho came home glee spirits wife noticed his
 happiness bowshot off, much made ask him, “what
 got, sancho friend, glad?”
 
replied, “wife, god’s will, very
 glad well pleased show myself.”
 
“i don’t understand you, husband,” said she, “and don’t know you
 mean saying glad, god’s will, well
 pleased; for, fool am, don’t know one can find pleasure in
 it.”
 
“hark ye, teresa,” replied sancho, “i glad made my
 mind go back service master don quixote, means to
 go third time seek adventures; going him
 again, necessities will so, also hope that
 cheers thought may find another hundred crowns like

 cross-roads—and small cost merely willing it—it is
 clear happiness solid lasting, happiness i
 mingled sorrow leaving thee; right in
 saying glad, god’s will, well pleased.”
 
“look here, sancho,” said teresa; “ever since joined a
 knight-errant talk roundabout way no
 understanding you.”
 
“it enough god understands me, wife,” replied sancho; “for he
 understander things; will do; mind, sister, you
 must look dapple carefully next three days, may
 fit take arms; double feed, see pack-saddle and
 harness, wedding bound, go round
 world, play give take giants dragons and
 monsters, hear hissings roarings bellowings howlings;
 even lavender, reckon with
 yanguesans enchanted moors.”
 
“i know well enough, husband,” said teresa, “that squires-errant don’t
 eat bread nothing, will always praying our
 lord deliver speedily hard fortune.”
 
“i can tell you, wife,” said sancho, “if expect see myself
 governor island long, drop dead spot.”
 
“nay, then, husband,” said teresa; “let hen live, though with
 pip, live, let devil take governments world;
 came mother’s womb without government, lived
 now without government, god’s will will go,
 carried, grave without government. many are
 world live without government, continue live all
 same, reckoned number people. best sauce

 get husband get government; and, all, daughter
 looks better ill married well whored.”
 
“by faith,” replied sancho, “if god brings get sort a
 government, intend, wife, make high match mari-sancha
 will approaching without calling ‘my lady.”
 
“nay, sancho,” returned teresa; “marry equal, the
 safest plan; put wooden clogs high-heeled
 shoes, grey flannel petticoat hoops silk gowns, out
 plain ‘marica’ ‘thou,’ ‘doña so-and-so’ ‘my lady,’
 girl won’t know is, every turn will fall into
 thousand blunders will show thread coarse homespun
 stuff.”
 
“tut, fool,” said sancho; “it will practise two
 three years; dignity decorum will fit easily as
 glove; not, matter? let ‘my lady,’ never mind
 happens.”
 
“keep station, sancho,” replied teresa; “don’t try raise
 higher, bear mind proverb says, ‘wipe nose
 neigbbour’s son, take house.’ fine thing it
 be, indeed, marry maria great count grand
 gentleman, who, humour took him, abuse call her
 clown-bred clodhopper’s daughter spinning wench. not
 bringing daughter time, can tell you,

 him, one sort, will well married, we

 children, grandchildren sons-in-law, peace blessing
 god will dwell among us; don’t go marrying those

“why, idiot wife barabbas,” said sancho, “what mean
 trying, without wherefore, keep marrying my
 daughter one will give grandchildren will called
 ‘your lordship’? look ye, teresa, always heard elders say

 him, right complain gives go-by; now
 knocking door, will shut out; let us
 go favouring breeze blows upon us.”
 
sort talk, sancho says lower down, made the
 translator history say considered chapter apocryphal.
 
“don’t see, animal,” continued sancho, “that will well
 drop profitable government will lift us of
 mire, marry mari-sancha like; will
 find called ‘doña teresa panza,’ sitting church a
 fine carpet cushions draperies, spite defiance all
 born ladies town? no, stay are, growing neither

“are sure say, husband?” replied teresa. “well, all
 that, afraid rank countess daughter will her

“i declare thou hast devil sort thy body!” said sancho.
 “god help thee, lot things thou hast strung together, one

“do know why, husband?” replied teresa; “because proverb
 says ‘who covers thee, discovers thee.’ poor man people

 said rich man time poor, the
 sneering tattle spite backbiters; streets
 swarm thick bees.”
 
“look here, teresa,” said sancho, “and listen now going to

observations sancho makes ones on

 apocryphal, inasmuch beyond sancho’s capacity.
 
“whence arises,” continued, “that see person well

 teresa, one will remember was, everyone will respect

“i understand you, husband,” replied teresa; “do like,
 don’t break head speechifying rethoric; if

“resolved, say, woman,” said sancho, “not revolved.”
 
“don’t set wrangle me, husband,” said teresa; “i speak
 god pleases, don’t deal out-of-the-way phrases; say if
 bent upon government, take sancho you,
 teach time hold government; sons
 inherit learn trades fathers.”
 
“as soon government,” said sancho, “i will send him
 post, will send thee money, shall lack, for
 never want people lend governors they
 got it; thou dress hide and
 make look be.”
 
“you send money,” said teresa, “and i’ll dress as
 fine please.”
 
“then agreed daughter countess,” said
 sancho.
 
“the day see countess,” replied teresa, “it will the
 burying her; say you
 please, women born burden obedient our
 husbands, though dogs;” began weep in
 earnest, already saw sanchica dead buried.
 
sancho consoled saying though must make countess,
 put long possible. conversation came

 arrangements departure.

sancho panza wife, teresa cascajo, held above
 irrelevant conversation, don quixote’s niece housekeeper not
 idle, thousand signs began perceive uncle
 master meant give slip third time, more
 betake his, them, ill-errant chivalry. strove by
 means power divert unlucky scheme;
 preaching desert hammering cold iron.
 nevertheless, among many representations made him, the
 housekeeper said him, “in truth, master, keep still
 stay quiet home, give roaming mountains valleys
 like troubled spirit, looking say called
 adventures, call misfortunes, shall make complaint
 god king loud supplication send remedy.”
 
don quixote replied, “what answer god will give your
 complaints, housekeeper, know not, majesty will answer
 either; know king decline answer the
 numberless silly petitions present every day; one the
 greatest among many troubles kings obliged listen
 answer all, therefore sorry affairs
 mine worry him.”
 
whereupon housekeeper said, “tell us, señor, majesty’s court
 knights?”
 
“there are,” replied don quixote, “and plenty them; right
 be, set dignity prince, the
 greater glory king’s majesty.”
 
“then might worship,” said she, “be one that, without
 stirring step, serve king lord court?”
 
“recollect, friend,” said don quixote, “all knights be
 courtiers, can courtiers knights-errant, need be.
 must sorts world; though may knights,
 great difference one another; courtiers,
 without quitting chambers, threshold court, range

 farthing, without suffering heat cold, hunger thirst; we,
 true knights-errant, measure whole earth feet,

 say, housekeeper, may see difference the
 one sort knight other; well no
 prince set higher value second, properly
 speaking first, kind knights-errant; for, read their
 histories, among salvation,
 merely one kingdom, many.”
 
“ah, señor,” exclaimed niece, “remember are
 saying knights-errant fable fiction; histories,
 indeed burned, deserve, them, a
 sambenito put it, mark might known as
 infamous corrupter good manners.”
 
“by god gives life,” said don quixote, “if thou wert my
 full niece, daughter sister, inflict a
 chastisement upon thee blasphemy thou hast uttered the
 world ring with. what! can young hussy hardly

 moreover great protector damsels; might

 low rank strain bursting pass gentlemen,
 high gentlemen who, one fancy, dying pass men of
 low rank; former raise ambition their

“there great deal truth say, niece,” returned don

instant housekeeper saw sancho panza shut her
 master, guessed about; suspecting the
 result consultation resolve undertake third

 find bachelor samson carrasco, thought that, a
 well-spoken man, new friend master’s, might able to
 persuade give crazy notion. found pacing the
 patio house, and, perspiring flurried, fell feet
 moment saw him.
 
carrasco, seeing distressed overcome was, said her,
 “what this, mistress housekeeper? happened you? one
 think heart-broken.”
 
“nothing, señor samson,” said she, “only master breaking
 out, plainly breaking out.”
 
“whereabouts breaking out, señora?” asked samson; “has part
 body burst?”
 
“he breaking door madness,” replied; “i
 mean, dear señor bachelor, going break (and
 will third time) hunt world he
 calls ventures, though can’t make gives name.

 sunk deep cells skull; bring round again,
 ever little, cost six hundred eggs, god knows, and
 world, hens too, won’t let tell lie.”
 
“that can well believe,” replied bachelor, “for good
 fat, well-bred, say one thing for
 another, though burst it. short then, mistress
 housekeeper, all, nothing matter, except what
 feared don quixote may do?”
 
“no, señor,” said she.
 
“well then,” returned bachelor, “don’t uneasy, go home in
 peace; get ready something hot breakfast, on
 way say prayer santa apollonia, know it; for
 will come presently will see miracles.”
 
“woe me,” cried housekeeper, “is prayer santa
 apollonia say? toothache
 master had; brains, got.”
 
“i know saying, mistress housekeeper; go, don’t set
 argue me, know bachelor salamanca,
 one can’t bachelor that,” replied carrasco; and
 housekeeper retired, bachelor went look for
 curate, arrange will told proper place.
 
don quixote sancho shut together, a
 discussion history records great precision and
 scrupulous exactness. sancho said master, “señor, educed
 wife let go worship wherever choose take me.”
 
“induced, say, sancho,” said don quixote; “not educed.”
 
“once twice, well remember,” replied sancho, “i begged
 worship mend words, understand i
 mean them; don’t understand say ‘sancho,’ or
 ‘devil,’ ‘i don’t understand thee; don’t make meaning
 plain, may correct me, focile—”
 
“i don’t understand thee, sancho,” said don quixote once; “for i
 know ‘i focile’ means.”
 
“‘so focile’ means much way,” replied sancho.
 
“i understand thee still less now,” said don quixote.
 
“well, can’t understand me,” said sancho, “i don’t know to
 put it; know more, god help me.”
 
“oh, now hit it,” said don quixote; “thou wouldst say thou art
 docile, tractable, gentle thou wilt take say to
 thee, submit teach thee.”
 
“i bet,” said sancho, “that first understood
 me, knew meant, wanted put might
 hear make another couple dozen blunders.”
 
“may so,” replied don quixote; “but come point, does
 teresa say?”
 
“teresa says,” replied sancho, “that make sure your
 worship, ‘let papers speak beards still,’ ‘he binds
 wrangle,’ since one ‘take’ better two ‘i’ll give
 thee’s;’ say woman’s advice great thing, won’t
 take fool.”
 
“and say i,” said don quixote; “continue, sancho friend; go on;
 talk pearls to-day.”
 
“the fact is,” continued sancho, “that, worship knows better
 do, us liable death, to-day are, and
 to-morrow not, lamb goes soon sheep, and
 nobody can promise hours life world god
 may pleased give him; death deaf, comes to
 knock life’s door, always urgent, neither prayers, nor
 struggles, sceptres, mitres, can keep back, common talk
 report say, tell us pulpits every day.”
 
“all true,” said don quixote; “but make what
 thou art driving at.”
 
“what driving at,” said sancho, “is worship settle some
 fixed wages me, paid monthly service, and
 paid estate; don’t care stand
 rewards either come late, ill, never all; god help me
 own. short, like know get, it
 much little; hen will lay one egg, many littles make
 much, long one gains something nothing lost. be
 sure, happen (what neither believe expect) your
 worship give island promised me, so
 ungrateful grasping willing the
 revenue island valued stopped wages due
 promotion.”
 
“sancho, friend,” replied don quixote, “sometimes proportion may be
 good promotion.”
 
“i see,” said sancho; “i’ll bet said proportion, and
 promotion; matter, worship understood me.”
 
“and well understood,” returned don quixote, “that seen into
 depths thy thoughts, know mark thou art shooting with
 countless shafts thy proverbs. look here, sancho, would
 readily fix thy wages ever found instance histories
 knights-errant show indicate, slightest hint, what
 squires used get monthly yearly; read the
 best part histories, remember reading any
 knight-errant assigned fixed wages squire; know
 served reward, least expected it,
 good luck attended masters, found recompensed
 island something equivalent it, least were
 left title lordship. hopes additional
 inducements you, sancho, please return service, well good;
 suppose going disturb unhinge ancient usage
 knight-errantry, nonsense. so, sancho, get back to
 house explain intentions teresa, likes
 like reward me, _bene quidem;_ not, remain
 friends; pigeon-house lack food, will lack
 pigeons; bear mind, son, good hope better a
 bad holding, good grievance better bad compensation. i
 speak way, sancho, show can shower proverbs
 just well yourself; short, mean say, say,
 don’t like come reward me, run same
 chance run, god make saint you; shall
 find plenty squires obedient painstaking, so
 thickheaded talkative are.”
 
sancho heard master’s firm, resolute language, cloud came
 sky wings heart drooped, had
 made sure master go without wealth
 world; stood dumbfoundered moody, samson
 carrasco came housekeeper niece, anxious to
 hear arguments dissuade master going
 seek adventures. arch wag samson came forward, embracing him
 done before, said loud voice, “o flower of
 knight-errantry! shining light arms! honour mirror the
 spanish nation! may god almighty infinite power grant any
 person persons, impede hinder thy third sally, may find
 way labyrinth schemes, ever accomplish what
 desire!” then, turning housekeeper, said,
 “mistress housekeeper may just well give saying prayer of
 santa apollonia, know positive determination the
 spheres señor don quixote shall proceed put execution his
 new lofty designs; lay heavy burden conscience
 urge persuade knight keep might his
 strong arm virtue valiant spirit longer curbed and
 checked, inactivity defrauding world the
 redress wrongs, protection orphans, honour of
 virgins, aid widows, support wives, other
 matters kind appertaining, belonging, proper peculiar to

 brave, let worship highness set to-day rather than
 to-morrow; anything needed execution purpose,
 ready person purse supply want; it
 requisite attend magnificence squire, esteem the
 happiest good fortune.”
 
this, don quixote, turning sancho, said, “did tell thee,
 sancho, squires enough spare me? see now who
 offers become one; less illustrious bachelor samson
 carrasco, perpetual joy delight courts salamancan
 schools, sound body, discreet, patient heat cold, hunger or
 thirst, qualifications requisite make knight-errant’s

“i deign,” said sancho, deeply moved tears eyes; “it
 shall said me, master mine,” continued, “‘the bread eaten
 company dispersed.’ nay, come ungrateful stock, all
 world knows, particularly town, panzas whom
 descended were; and, more, know learned, by
 many good words deeds, worship’s desire show favour; and

bachelor filled amazement heard sancho’s
 phraseology style talk, though read first part of
 master’s history never thought droll he
 described; now, hearing talk “will codicil
 provoked,” instead “will codicil could
 revoked,” believed read him, set down
 one greatest simpletons modern times; said to

“blessed allah all-powerful!” says hamete benengeli beginning
 eighth chapter; “blessed allah!” repeats three times; he
 says utters thanksgivings seeing now got don
 quixote sancho fairly afield, readers his
 delightful history may reckon achievements humours don
 quixote squire now begin; urges to
 forget former chivalries ingenious gentleman fix
 eyes come, now begin road el

 asks consideration promises, goes to
 say:
 
don quixote sancho left alone, moment samson took his
 departure, rocinante began neigh, dapple sigh, which, both
 knight squire, accepted good sign happy omen;
 though, truth told, sighs brays dapple were
 louder neighings hack, sancho inferred that
 good fortune exceed overtop master,
 building, perhaps, upon judicial astrology may known,
 though history says nothing it; can said is, that
 stumbled fell, heard say wished come
 out, stumbling falling nothing got a
 damaged shoe broken rib; and, fool was, much
 astray this.
 
said don quixote, “sancho, friend, night drawing upon us we
 go, darkly will allow us reach toboso daylight;
 resolved go engage another adventure, and
 shall obtain blessing generous permission the
 peerless dulcinea, permission expect feel assured that
 shall conclude bring happy termination every perilous
 adventure; nothing life makes knights-errant valorous than

“so believe,” replied sancho; “but think will difficult for
 worship speak see her, rate will
 able receive blessing; unless, indeed, throws the
 wall yard saw time before, took the
 letter told follies mad things worship doing
 heart sierra morena.”
 
“didst thou take yard wall, sancho,” said don quixote,
 “where thou sawest never sufficiently extolled grace
 beauty? must gallery, corridor, portico some
 rich royal palace.”
 
“it might that,” returned sancho, “but looked
 like wall, unless short memory.”
 
“at events, let us go there, sancho,” said don quixote; “for, so
 see her, whether wall, a
 window, chink door, grate garden; for
 beam sun beauty reaches eyes will give light
 reason strength heart, shall unmatched and
 unequalled wisdom valour.”
 
“well, tell truth, señor,” said sancho, “when saw sun of
 lady dulcinea toboso, bright enough throw out
 beams all; must been, grace sifting that
 wheat told of, thick dust raised came face
 like cloud dimmed it.”
 
“what! dost thou still persist, sancho,” said don quixote, “in saying,
 thinking, believing, maintaining lady dulcinea sifting
 wheat, occupation task entirely variance what
 employment persons distinction, are
 constituted reserved avocations pursuits show
 rank bowshot off? thou hast forgotten, sancho, lines of
 poet wherein paints us how, crystal abodes, those
 four nymphs employed rose loved tagus and
 seated verdant meadow embroider tissues which
 ingenious poet describes us, worked and
 woven gold silk pearls; something sort must
 employment lady thou sawest her, the
 spite wicked enchanter seems everything of
 mine changes things give pleasure, turns them
 shapes unlike own; fear history my
 achievements say now print, haply author was
 sage enemy mine, will put one thing for
 another, mingling thousand lies one truth, amusing himself
 relating transactions nothing sequence of
 true history. envy, root countless evils, cankerworm of
 virtues! vices, sancho, bring kind pleasure with
 them; envy brings nothing irritation, bitterness, rage.”
 
“so say too,” replied sancho; “and suspect legend or
 history us bachelor samson carrasco told us saw, my
 honour goes dragged dirt, knocked about, down, sweeping
 streets, say. yet, faith honest man, i
 never spoke ill enchanter, well to

 mortal enemy jews, historians mercy and
 treat well writings. let say like; naked
 born, naked find myself, neither lose gain; nay, i
 see put book passed hand hand the
 world, don’t care fig, let say like me.”
 
“that, sancho,” returned don quixote, “reminds happened a
 famous poet day, who, written bitter satire against
 courtesan ladies, insert name certain lady
 questionable whether one not. she, seeing she
 list poet, asked seen that
 include number others, telling must
 add satire put new part, else look the
 consequences. poet bade him, left without a
 shred reputation, satisfied getting fame though it

 wonders world, burned sole object making his
 name live ages; and, though forbidden name him, or
 mention name word mouth writing, lest object his
 ambition attained, nevertheless became known was
 called erostratus. something sort happened in
 case great emperor charles v. gentleman rome. the
 emperor anxious see famous temple rotunda, called in
 ancient times temple ‘of gods,’ now-a-days, better
 nomenclature, ‘of saints,’ best preserved building
 pagan construction rome, one best

 behind world name last ever.’ ‘i thankful
 carrying evil thought effect,’ said the
 emperor, ‘and shall give opportunity future again
 putting loyalty test; therefore forbid ever to
 speak am; followed words by
 bestowing liberal bounty upon him. meaning is, sancho, the
 desire acquiring fame powerful motive. what, thinkest
 thou, flung horatius full armour bridge

 though catholic christians knights-errant look that
 future glory everlasting ethereal regions heaven than
 vanity fame acquired present
 transitory life; fame that, however long may last, must all
 end world itself, appointed end. that, o
 sancho, must overpass bounds the
 christian religion profess assigned us. slay pride
 giants, envy generosity nobleness heart, anger calmness
 demeanour equanimity, gluttony sloth spareness our
 diet length vigils, lust lewdness loyalty we
 preserve made mistresses thoughts,
 indolence traversing world directions seeking
 opportunities making ourselves, besides christians, famous knights.
 such, sancho, means reach extremes praise
 fair fame carries it.”
 
“all worship said far,” said sancho, “i have
 understood quite well; still glad worship would
 dissolve doubt me, just minute come mind.”
 
“solve, thou meanest, sancho,” said don quixote; “say on, god’s
 name, will answer well can.”
 
“tell me, señor,” sancho went say, “those julys augusts, and
 venturous knights say now dead—where they
 now?”
 
“the heathens,” replied don quixote, “are, doubt, hell; the
 christians, good christians, either purgatory in
 heaven.”
 
“very good,” said sancho; “but now want know—the tombs the
 bodies great lords are, silver lamps them, or
 walls chapels ornamented crutches,
 winding-sheets, tresses hair, legs eyes wax? they
 ornamented with?”
 
don quixote made answer: “the tombs heathens were
 generally sumptuous temples; ashes julius cæsar’s body were
 placed top stone pyramid vast size, now call
 rome saint peter’s needle. emperor hadrian tomb a
 castle large good-sized village, called _moles
 adriani_, now castle st. angelo rome. queen
 artemisia buried husband mausolus tomb reckoned one
 seven wonders world; none tombs, the
 many others heathens, ornamented winding-sheets any
 offerings tokens show buried
 saints.”
 
“that’s point i’m coming to,” said sancho; “and now tell me, which
 greater work, bring dead man life kill giant?”
 
“the answer easy,” replied don quixote; “it greater work to
 bring life dead man.”
 
“now got you,” said sancho; “in case fame who
 bring dead life, give sight blind, cure cripples,
 restore health sick, whose tombs lamps
 burning, whose chapels filled devout folk knees
 adoring relics better fame life other
 heathen emperors knights-errant have
 ever world left may leave behind them?”
 
“that grant, too,” said don quixote.
 
“then fame, favours, privileges, whatever call
 it,” said sancho, “belong bodies relics saints who,
 approbation permission holy mother church, have
 lamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes legs, by
 means increase devotion add christian
 reputation. kings carry bodies relics saints their
 shoulders, kiss bits bones, enrich adorn their
 oratories favourite altars them.”
 
“what wouldst thou infer thou hast said, sancho?”
 asked don quixote.
 
“my meaning is,” said sancho, “let us set becoming saints, we
 shall obtain quickly fair fame striving after; you
 know, señor, yesterday day yesterday (for lately
 one may say so) canonised beatified two little barefoot
 friars, now reckoned greatest good luck kiss touch
 iron chains girt tortured bodies, and
 held greater veneration, said, sword of
 roland armoury lord king, god preserve. that,
 señor, better humble little friar matter what
 order, valiant knight-errant; god couple dozen of
 penance lashings avail two thousand lance-thrusts, be
 given giants, monsters, dragons.”
 
“all true,” returned don quixote, “but friars,
 many ways god takes heaven; chivalry is
 religion, sainted knights glory.”
 
“yes,” said sancho, “but heard say friars in
 heaven knights-errant.”
 
“that,” said don quixote, “is religious orders are
 numerous knights.”
 
“the errants many,” said sancho.
 
“many,” replied don quixote, “but deserve name of
 knights.”
 
these, discussions sort, passed that
 night following day, without anything worth mention happening
 them, whereat don quixote little dejected; length
 next day, daybreak, descried great city toboso,
 sight don quixote’s spirits rose sancho’s fell, for
 know dulcinea’s house, life ever seen
 her, master; uneasy, one
 see her, seen her, sancho loss

 end, don quixote made mind enter city nightfall, and
 waited time came among oak trees near el
 toboso; moment agreed upon arrived, made
 entrance city, something happened may
 fairly called something.

’twas midnight hour—more less—when don quixote and
 sancho quitted wood entered toboso. town deep
 silence, inhabitants asleep, stretched the
 broad backs, saying is. night darkish, though
 sancho glad quite dark, find in
 darkness excuse blundering. place nothing
 heard except barking dogs, deafened ears of
 don quixote troubled heart sancho. now ass
 brayed, pigs grunted, cats mewed, various noises made
 seemed louder silence night; enamoured
 knight took evil omen; nevertheless said sancho,
 “sancho, son, lead palace dulcinea, may we

“body sun! palace lead to,” said sancho, “when what
 saw highness little house?”
 
“most likely withdrawn small apartment her
 palace,” said don quixote, “to amuse damsels, great
 ladies princesses accustomed do.”
 
“señor,” said sancho, “if worship will spite that
 house lady dulcinea palace, hour, think you,
 find door open; will right us go knocking till
 hear us open door; making disturbance confusion all
 household? going, fancy, house our
 wenches, like gallants come knock go hour,
 however late may be?”
 
“let us first find palace certain,” replied don
 quixote, “and will tell thee, sancho, best do; but
 look, sancho, either see badly, dark mass one sees
 dulcinea’s palace.”
 
“then let worship lead way,” said sancho, “perhaps may be
 so; though see eyes touch hands, i’ll
 believe much believe daylight now.”
 
don quixote took lead, gone matter two hundred
 paces came upon mass produced shade, found a
 great tower, perceived building question no
 palace, chief church town, said he, “it’s church
 lit upon, sancho.”
 
“so see,” said sancho, “and god grant may light upon our
 graves; good sign find oneself wandering graveyard at
 time night; that, telling worship, don’t
 mistake, house lady will alley without an
 outlet.”
 
“the curse god thee blockhead!” said don quixote; “where
 hast thou ever heard castles royal palaces built alleys
 without outlet?”
 
“señor,” replied sancho, “every country way own; perhaps
 toboso way build palaces grand buildings in
 alleys; entreat worship let search among these
 streets alleys me, perhaps, corner other, i
 may stumble palace—and wish saw dogs eating for
 leading us dance.”
 
“speak respectfully belongs lady, sancho,” said don
 quixote; “let us keep feast peace, throw rope after
 bucket.”
 
“i’ll hold tongue,” said sancho, “but take patiently
 worship wants me, seeing house our
 mistress, know always, find middle night, when
 worship can’t find it, must seen thousands times?”
 
“thou wilt drive desperation, sancho,” said don quixote. “look
 here, heretic, told thee thousand times never
 life seen peerless dulcinea crossed threshold of
 palace, enamoured solely hearsay great
 reputation bears beauty discretion?”
 
“i hear now,” returned sancho; “and may tell have
 seen her, i.”
 
“that be,” said don quixote, “for, rate, thou saidst, on
 bringing back answer letter sent thee, thou sawest
 sifting wheat.”
 
“don’t mind that, señor,” said sancho; “i must tell seeing
 answer brought back hearsay too, can no
 tell lady dulcinea can hit sky.”
 
“sancho, sancho,” said don quixote, “there times jests and
 times jests place; tell thee neither

 shouldst say thou hast spoken seen her, contrary
 case, thou well knowest.”
 
two engaged conversation, perceived someone

 says-
 
ill ye fare, ye men france,

“may die, sancho,” said don quixote, heard him, “if good

 singing?”
 
“i do,” said sancho, “but roncesvalles chase what
 hand? might just well singing ballad of
 calainos, good ill can come us business.”
 
time labourer come up, don quixote asked him, “can
 tell me, worthy friend, god speed you, whereabouts the
 palace peerless princess doña dulcinea toboso?”
 
“señor,” replied lad, “i stranger, few

“well, then, inquiring will one these, friend,”
 said don quixote.
 
“may so,” replied lad; “god you, comes the
 daylight;” without waiting questions, he
 whipped mules.
 
sancho, seeing master downcast somewhat dissatisfied, said to
 him, “señor, daylight will long, will for
 us let sun find us street; will better us to

author great history comes relate set down
 chapter says preferred pass in
 silence, fearing believed, don quixote’s
 madness reaches confines greatest can conceived, and
 even goes couple bowshots beyond greatest. all,
 though still fear apprehension, recorded it
 without adding story leaving particle truth, and
 entirely disregarding charges falsehood might brought
 him; right, truth may run fine will not
 break, always rises falsehood oil water; so,
 going story, says soon don quixote had
 ensconced forest, oak grove, wood near toboso, he
 bade sancho return city, come presence again
 without first spoken behalf lady, begged of
 might good pleasure permit seen by
 enslaved knight, deign bestow blessing upon him, that
 might thereby hope happy issue encounters and
 difficult enterprises. sancho undertook execute task according
 instructions, bring back answer good one he
 brought back before.
 
“go, son,” said don quixote, “and dazed thou findest
 thyself exposed light sun beauty thou art going to
 seek. happy thou, squires world! bear mind, and
 let escape thy memory, receives thee; changes
 colour thou art giving message; agitated and
 disturbed hearing name; rest upon cushion,
 shouldst thou haply find seated sumptuous state chamber
 proper rank; standing, observe poises
 now one foot, now other; repeats two three
 times reply gives thee; passes gentleness to
 austerity, asperity tenderness; raises hand to
 smooth hair though disarranged. short, son, observe
 actions motions, thou wilt report they
 were, will gather hides recesses heart as
 regards love; thee know, sancho, thou knowest it
 not, lovers outward actions motions give way to
 loves question faithful messengers carry
 news going depths hearts. go, my
 friend, may better fortune mine attend thee, bring thee a
 happier issue await dread dreary
 solitude.”
 
“i will go return quickly,” said sancho; “cheer little
 heart yours, master mine, present moment seem have
 got one bigger hazel nut; remember say, a
 stout heart breaks bad luck, fletches there

 looked for. say because, find lady’s palaces

 least expect it, found, leave manage her.”
 
“verily, sancho,” said don quixote, “thou dost always bring thy
 proverbs happily, whatever deal with; may god give better luck in
 anxious about.”
 
this, sancho wheeled gave dapple stick, don
 quixote remained behind, seated horse, resting stirrups
 leaning end lance, filled sad troubled
 forebodings; will leave him, accompany sancho, who
 went less serious troubled left master; much
 so, soon got thicket, looking round
 saw don quixote within sight, dismounted ass,
 seating foot tree began commune with
 himself, saying, “now, brother sancho, let us know worship
 going. going look ass lost? at
 all. going look for? going look a

 strike just right toboso

 tamper princesses trouble ladies, come and

 indeed, good reason, see under
 orders, ‘you messenger, friend, blame belongs to

 you, promise you. off, scoundrel! let bolt fall. why
 go looking three feet cat, please another man; and
 more, looking dulcinea will looking marica in
 ravena, bachelor salamanca? devil, devil nobody

soliloquy sancho held himself, conclusion
 come say again, “well, there’s remedy for
 everything except death, whose yoke pass, whether
 like not, life’s finished. seen thousand
 signs master mine madman fit tied, that
 matter, too, behind him; i’m greater fool is

reflection sancho made mind easy, counting business
 good settled, stayed till afternoon make
 don quixote think time enough go toboso return; and
 things turned luckily got mount dapple,
 spied, coming toboso towards spot stood, three
 peasant girls three colts, fillies—for author make
 point clear, though likely she-asses, the
 usual mount village girls; great consequence,
 need stop prove it.
 
brief, instant sancho saw peasant girls, returned full
 speed seek master, found sighing uttering thousand
 passionate lamentations. don quixote saw exclaimed, “what
 news, sancho, friend? mark day white stone a
 black?”
 
“your worship,” replied sancho, “had better mark ruddle, like
 inscriptions walls class rooms, see may
 see plain.”
 
“then thou bringest good news,” said don quixote.
 
“so good,” replied sancho, “that worship spur
 rocinante get open field see lady dulcinea del
 toboso, who, two others, damsels hers, coming see your
 worship.”
 
“holy god! art thou saying, sancho, friend?” exclaimed don
 quixote. “take care thou art deceiving me, seeking false joy
 cheer real sadness.”
 
“what get deceiving worship,” returned sancho,
 “especially will soon shown whether tell truth or
 not? come, señor, push on, will see princess mistress
 coming, robed adorned—in fact, like is. damsels and
 one glow gold, bunches pearls, diamonds, all
 rubies, cloth brocade ten borders; hair
 loose shoulders like many sunbeams playing wind;
 moreover, come mounted three piebald cackneys, finest
 sight ever saw.”
 
“hackneys, mean, sancho,” said don quixote.
 
“there much difference cackneys hackneys,” said
 sancho; “but matter come on, are, finest
 ladies one wish for, especially lady princess dulcinea,
 staggers one’s senses.”
 
“let us go, sancho, son,” said don quixote, “and guerdon this
 news, unexpected good, bestow upon thee best spoil i
 shall win first adventure may have; not
 satisfy thee, promise thee foals shall year my
 three mares thou knowest foal village common.”
 
“i’ll take foals,” said sancho; “for quite certain that
 spoils first adventure will good ones.”
 
time cleared wood, saw three village
 lasses close hand. don quixote looked along road el
 toboso, see nobody except three peasant girls, he
 completely puzzled, asked sancho outside city he
 left them.
 
“how outside city?” returned sancho. “are worship’s eyes in
 back head, can’t see are
 coming here, shining like sun noonday?”
 
“i see nothing, sancho,” said don quixote, “but three country girls on
 three jackasses.”
 
“now, may god deliver devil!” said sancho, “and can be
 worship takes three hackneys—or whatever they’re called—as
 white driven snow, jackasses? lord, tear my
 beard case!”
 
“well, can say, sancho, friend,” said don quixote, “that it
 plain jackasses—or jennyasses—as don quixote,
 thou sancho panza: rate, seem so.”
 
“hush, señor,” said sancho, “don’t talk way, open eyes,
 come pay respects lady thoughts, is
 close upon us now;” words advanced receive the
 three village lasses, dismounting dapple, caught hold one
 asses three country girls halter, dropping on
 knees ground, said, “queen princess duchess of
 beauty, may please haughtiness greatness receive into
 favour good-will captive knight stands turned
 marble stone, quite stupefied benumbed finding himself
 magnificent presence. sancho panza, squire, the
 vagabond knight don quixote mancha, otherwise called ‘the knight
 rueful countenance.’”
 
don quixote time placed knees beside sancho,
 and, eyes starting head puzzled gaze, was
 regarding sancho called queen lady; see
 nothing except village lass, well-favoured one,
 platter-faced snub-nosed, perplexed and
 bewildered, venture open lips. country girls, at
 time, astonished see two men, different in
 appearance, knees, preventing companion going on.
 she, however, stopped, breaking silence, said angrily and
 testily, “get way, bad luck you, let us pass, we
 hurry.”

sancho returned, “oh, princess universal lady el
 toboso, magnanimous heart softened seeing pillar and
 prop knight-errantry knees sublimated presence?”
 
hearing this, one others exclaimed, “woa then! why, i’m
 rubbing thee down, she-ass father-in-law! see lordlings
 come make game village girls now, not
 chaff well themselves. go way, let us go ours, and
 will better you.”
 
“get up, sancho,” said don quixote this; “i see fortune, ‘with
 evil done unsated still,’ taken possession roads
 comfort may reach ‘this wretched soul’ carry my
 flesh. thou, highest perfection excellence can desired,
 utmost limit grace human shape, sole relief afflicted
 heart adores thee, though malign enchanter persecutes me

 submission make knees thy transformed beauty the
 humility soul adores thee.”
 
“hey-day! grandfather!” cried girl, “much care your
 love-making! get way let us pass, we’ll thank you.”
 
sancho stood aside let go, well pleased got so
 well hobble in. instant village lass had
 done duty dulcinea found free, prodding “cackney” with
 spike end stick, set full speed across
 field. she-ass, however, feeling point acutely than
 usual, began cutting capers, flung lady dulcinea to
 ground; seeing which, don quixote ran raise up, sancho
 fix girth pack-saddle, also slipped the
 ass’s belly. pack-saddle secured, don quixote to
 lift enchanted mistress arms put upon beast,
 lady, getting ground, saved trouble, for, going
 back little, took short run, putting hands the
 croup ass dropped saddle lightly a
 falcon, sat astride like man, whereat sancho said, “rogue! but
 lady lighter lanner, might teach cleverest
 cordovan mexican mount; cleared back saddle in
 one jump, without spurs making hackney go like zebra;
 damsels way behind her, fly like wind;”
 truth, soon saw dulcinea mounted, they
 pushed her, sped away without looking back, than

don quixote followed eyes, longer

 hated enchanters! see length malice and
 spite bear go, seek deprive happiness it
 give see lady proper form. fact was

 was, though appeared she-ass), gave whiff raw

“o scum earth!” cried sancho this, “o miserable, spiteful
 enchanters! see strung gills, like
 sardines twig! ye know great deal, ye can great deal, and
 ye great deal more. enough you, ye
 scoundrels, changed pearls lady’s eyes oak

“well, can say plain be,” replied
 sancho.
 
“i believe it, friend,” returned don quixote; “for nature bestowed
 nothing dulcinea perfect well-finished; so, if

dejected beyond measure don quixote pursue journey, turning
 mind cruel trick enchanters played in
 changing lady dulcinea vile shape village lass, nor
 think way restoring original form; and
 reflections absorbed him, without aware he
 let go rocinante’s bridle, he, perceiving liberty was
 granted him, stopped every step crop fresh grass which
 plain abounded.
 
sancho recalled reverie. “melancholy, señor,” said he,
 “was made, beasts, men; men give way it
 overmuch turn beasts; control yourself, worship; be
 again; gather rocinante’s reins; cheer up, rouse yourself
 show gallant spirit knights-errant have. what
 devil this? weakness this? france? the
 devil fly away dulcineas world; well-being
 single knight-errant consequence the
 enchantments transformations earth.”
 
“hush, sancho,” said don quixote weak faint voice, “hush and
 utter blasphemies enchanted lady; alone to
 blame misfortune hard fate; calamity come the
 hatred wicked bear me.”
 
“so say i,” returned sancho; “his heart rend twain, trow, saw
 once, see now.”
 
“thou mayest well say that, sancho,” replied don quixote, “as thou
 sawest full perfection beauty; enchantment
 go far pervert thy vision hide loveliness from
 thee; alone eyes strength venom
 directed. nevertheless, one thing occurred me,
 thou didst ill describe beauty me, for, well
 recollect, thou saidst eyes pearls; eyes that
 like pearls rather eyes sea-bream lady, and
 persuaded dulcinea’s must green emeralds, full soft,
 two rainbows eyebrows; take away pearls eyes
 transfer teeth; beyond doubt, sancho, thou hast
 taken one other, eyes teeth.”
 
“very likely,” said sancho; “for beauty bewildered much as
 ugliness worship; let us leave god, who
 alone knows happen vale tears, evil world
 ours, hardly thing found without mixture
 wickedness, roguery, rascality. one thing, señor, troubles
 rest, thinking done when
 worship conquers giant, knight, orders him
 go present beauty lady dulcinea. where
 poor giant, poor wretch vanquished knight, find
 her? think can see wandering toboso, looking like
 noddies, asking lady dulcinea; even meet in
 middle street won’t know would
 father.”
 
“perhaps, sancho,” returned don quixote, “the enchantment go
 far deprive conquered presented giants knights the
 power recognising dulcinea; will try experiment one or
 two first vanquish send her, whether see or
 not, commanding return give account what
 happened respect.”
 
“i declare, think worship proposed excellent,” said
 sancho; “and plan shall find want know;
 worship hidden, the
 misfortune will hers; long lady
 dulcinea well happy, part will make best it,
 get well can, seeking adventures, leaving time
 take course; best physician and
 greater ailments.”
 
don quixote reply sancho panza, prevented by
 cart crossing road full diverse strange
 personages figures imagined. led mules and
 acted carter hideous demon; cart open sky,
 without tilt cane roof, first figure presented itself
 don quixote’s eyes death human face; next
 angel large painted wings, one side an
 emperor, crown, appearance gold, head. the
 feet death god called cupid, without bandage, with
 bow, quiver, arrows; also knight full armour,
 except morion helmet, hat decked with
 plumes divers colours; along others a
 variety costumes faces. this, unexpectedly encountered, took
 don quixote somewhat aback, struck terror heart sancho;
 next instant don quixote glad it, believing some
 new perilous adventure presenting him, this
 impression, spirit prepared face danger, planted
 front cart, loud menacing tone,
 exclaimed, “carter, coachman, devil, whatever thou art, tell
 thou art, whither thou art going, folk are
 thou carriest thy wagon, looks like charon’s boat an
 ordinary cart.”
 
devil, stopping cart, answered quietly, “señor, are
 players angulo malo’s company; acting play of
 ‘the cortés death’ morning, octave corpus
 christi, village behind hill, act this
 afternoon village can see this; so
 near, save trouble undressing dressing again, go
 costumes perform. lad appears death,
 angel, woman, manager’s wife, plays the
 queen, one soldier, emperor, devil; i
 one principal characters play, company i
 take leading parts. want know anything us, ask
 will answer utmost exactitude, devil i
 everything.”
 
“by faith knight-errant,” replied don quixote, “when saw
 cart fancied great adventure presenting me;
 declare one must touch hand appears eye, if
 illusions avoided. god speed you, good people; keep your
 festival, remember, demand wherein can render
 service, will gladly willingly, child i
 fond play, youth keen lover actor’s art.”
 
talking, fate willed one company a
 mummers’ dress great number bells, armed three blown
 ox-bladders end stick, joined them, merry-andrew
 approaching don quixote, began flourishing stick banging the
 ground bladders cutting capers great jingling the
 bells, untoward apparition startled rocinante that, spite
 don quixote’s efforts hold in, taking bit his
 teeth set across plain greater speed bones of
 anatomy ever gave promise of.

sancho, thought master danger thrown, jumped

 rocinante’s vivacity high spirits. moment sancho quitted

 bladders jumped dapple, beating them, the
 fright noise pain blows, made fly across
 fields towards village going hold their
 festival. sancho witnessed dapple’s career master’s fall, and
 know two cases need attend first;
 end, like good squire good servant, let love
 master prevail affection ass; though every
 time saw bladders rise air come hind
 quarters dapple felt pains terrors death, he
 rather blows fall apples eyes than
 least hair ass’s tail. trouble perplexity he
 came don quixote lay far sorrier plight liked,
 helped mount rocinante, said him, “señor, the
 devil carried dapple.”
 
“what devil?” asked don quixote.
 
“the one bladders,” said sancho.
 
“then will recover him,” said don quixote, “even shut up
 deepest darkest dungeons hell. follow me,
 sancho, cart goes slowly, mules will make
 good loss dapple.”
 
“you need take trouble, señor,” said sancho; “keep cool, as
 now see, devil let dapple go coming back old
 quarters;” turned out, for, come dapple, in
 imitation don quixote rocinante, devil made foot to
 town, ass came back master.
 
“for that,” said don quixote, “it will well visit the
 discourtesy devil upon cart, even it
 emperor himself.”
 
“don’t think it, worship,” returned sancho; “take advice and
 never meddle actors, favoured class; have
 known actor taken two murders, yet come scot-free;
 remember that, merry folk give pleasure, everyone
 favours protects them, helps makes much them, all
 royal companies patent, or
 dress appearance look like princes.”
 
“still, that,” said don quixote, “the player devil must go
 boasting, even whole human race favours him.”
 
saying, made cart, now near town,
 shouting went, “stay! halt! ye merry, jovial crew! want to
 teach treat asses animals serve squires of
 knights-errant steeds.”
 
loud shouts don quixote, cart heard
 understood them, and, guessing words speaker’s
 intention was, death instant jumped cart, the
 emperor, devil carter angel him, queen or
 god cupid stay behind; armed stones and
 formed line, prepared receive don quixote points their
 pebbles. don quixote, saw drawn gallant array
 uplifted arms ready mighty discharge stones, checked
 rocinante began consider way attack with
 least danger himself. halted sancho came up, seeing
 disposed attack well-ordered squadron, said him, “it
 height madness attempt enterprise; remember,
 señor, sops brook, plenty them, is
 defensive armour world, except stow oneself away a
 brass bell; besides, one remember rashness, and
 valour, single man attack army death it,
 emperors fight person, angels, good bad, help
 them; reflection will make keep quiet, perhaps it
 will know certain among these, though look like
 kings, princes, emperors, single knight-errant.”
 
“now indeed thou hast hit point, sancho,” said don quixote, “which
 may turn resolution already formed. i
 must draw sword, many time told thee,
 anyone dubbed knight; thee, sancho, if
 thou wilt, take vengeance wrong done thy dapple; i
 will help thee shouts salutary counsels.”
 
“there occasion take vengeance anyone, señor,” replied
 sancho; “for part good christians revenge wrongs;
 besides, will arrange ass leave grievance my
 good-will pleasure, live peace long heaven
 grants life.”
 
“well,” said don quixote, “if thy determination, good sancho,
 sensible sancho, christian sancho, honest sancho, let us leave these
 phantoms alone turn pursuit better worthier
 adventures; for, see country, fail to
 find plenty marvellous ones it.”
 
wheeled about, sancho ran take possession dapple,
 death flying squadron returned cart pursued their
 journey, thus dread adventure cart death ended
 happily, thanks advice sancho gave master; had, the
 following day, fresh adventure, less thrilling interest than

 cupid’s painted wings fallen thee spoils, should
 taken force given thy hands.”
 
“the sceptres crowns play-actor emperors,” said sancho,
 “were never yet pure gold, brass foil tin.”
 
“that true,” said don quixote, “for right the
 accessories drama real, instead mere fictions
 semblances, like drama itself; towards which, sancho—and, a
 necessary consequence, towards represent produce it—i

 divers personages introduced? one plays villain,
 another knave, one merchant, soldier, one the
 sharp-witted fool, another foolish lover; play is
 over, put dresses wore it, actors
 become equal.”
 
“yes, seen that,” said sancho.
 
“well then,” said don quixote, “the thing happens comedy
 life world, play emperors, others popes, and, in
 short, characters can brought play; it
 over, say life ends, death strips the
 garments distinguish one other, equal the

“a fine comparison!” said sancho; “though new have
 heard many many time, well one game of
 chess; how, long game lasts, piece own
 particular office, game finished mixed,
 jumbled shaken together, stowed away bag, is
 much like ending life grave.”
 
“thou art growing less doltish shrewd every day, sancho,” said
 don quixote.
 
“ay,” said sancho; “it must worship’s shrewdness

conversation kind passed good part night, but
 sancho felt desire let curtains eyes, used
 say wanted go sleep; stripping dapple left him
 liberty graze fill. remove rocinante’s saddle, as
 master’s express orders were, long the
 field sleeping roof rocinante stripped—the
 ancient usage established observed knights-errant take
 bridle hang saddle-bow, remove saddle
 horse—never! sancho acted accordingly, gave same
 liberty given dapple, rocinante a
 friendship unequalled strong, handed by
 tradition father son, author veracious history
 devoted special chapters it, which, order preserve the
 propriety decorum due history heroic, insert
 therein; although times forgets resolution and
 describes eagerly two beasts scratch one another when

 ground, three days, least long left
 alone, hunger drive go look food. may add
 say author left record likened their
 friendship nisus euryalus, pylades orestes; and
 so, may perceived, admiration mankind, how
 firm friendship must two peaceful animals,
 shaming men, preserve friendships one another badly. this

let one fancy author astray compared
 friendship animals men; men received
 many lessons beasts, learned many important things, as, for
 example, clyster stork, vomit gratitude dog,
 watchfulness crane, foresight ant, modesty the
 elephant, loyalty horse.
 
sancho last fell asleep foot cork tree, don
 quixote dozed sturdy oak; short time had
 elapsed noise heard behind awoke him, rising up
 startled, listened looked direction noise came from,
 perceived two men horseback, one whom, letting drop
 saddle, said other, “dismount, friend, take the
 bridles horses, for, far can see, place will
 furnish grass them, solitude silence love-sick
 thoughts need of.” said stretched upon the
 ground, flung down, armour clad
 rattled, whereby don quixote perceived must knight-errant;
 going sancho, asleep, shook arm and
 small difficulty brought back senses, said a
 low voice him, “brother sancho, got adventure.”
 
“god send us good one,” said sancho; “and may ladyship the
 adventure be?”
 
“where, sancho?” replied don quixote; “turn thine eyes look, and
 thou wilt see stretched knight-errant, who, strikes me, is
 happy, saw fling horse and
 throw ground certain air dejection, his
 armour rattled fell.”
 
“well,” said sancho, “how worship make an
 adventure?”
 
“i mean say,” returned don quixote, “that complete
 adventure, beginning one, way
 adventures begin. listen, seems tuning lute or
 guitar, way spitting clearing chest must
 getting ready sing something.”
 
“faith, right,” said sancho, “and doubt enamoured
 knight.”
 
“there knight-errant not,” said don quixote; “but let us
 listen him, for, sings, thread shall extract the
 ball thoughts; abundance heart the
 mouth speaketh.”
 
sancho reply master, knight grove’s
 voice, neither bad good, stopped him, and
 listening attentively pair heard sing this
 
sonnet

“ah me!” seemed drawn inmost recesses of
 heart, knight grove brought lay end, and
 shortly afterwards exclaimed melancholy piteous voice, “o
 fairest ungrateful woman earth! what! can be, most
 serene casildea vandalia, thou wilt suffer thy captive
 knight waste away perish ceaseless wanderings rude and
 arduous toils? enough compelled knights
 navarre, leonese, tartesians, castilians,
 finally knights mancha, confess thee most
 beautiful world?”
 
“not so,” said don quixote this, “for mancha, have
 never confessed anything sort, confess
 thing much prejudice lady’s beauty; thou seest how
 knight raving, sancho. let us listen, perhaps will tell
 us himself.”
 
“that will,” returned sancho, “for seems mood bewail

case, knight grove, hearing voices
 near him, instead continuing lamentation, stood exclaimed
 distinct courteous tone, “who goes there? you? you
 belong number happy miserable?”
 
“of miserable,” answered don quixote.
 
“then come me,” said grove, “and rest assured is
 woe affliction come.”
 
don quixote, finding answered soft courteous
 manner, went him, sancho.
 
doleful knight took don quixote arm, saying, “sit here,
 sir knight; for, one, profess
 knight-errantry, sufficient proof found in
 place, solitude night, natural couch proper
 retreat knights-errant, keep company.” don made answer,
 “a knight profession mention, though sorrows,
 misfortunes, calamities made heart abode, the
 compassion feel misfortunes others thereby
 banished it. just now sung gather yours
 spring love, mean love bear fair ingrate you
 named lament.”
 
meantime, seated together hard ground
 peaceably sociably, just if, soon day broke, not
 going break one another’s heads.
 
“are you, sir knight, love perchance?” asked grove don
 quixote.
 
“by mischance am,” replied don quixote; “though ills arising from
 well-bestowed affections esteemed favours rather than
 misfortunes.”
 
“that true,” returned grove, “if scorn unsettle
 reason understanding, excessive looks like
 revenge.”
 
“i never scorned lady,” said don quixote.
 
“certainly not,” said sancho, stood close by, “for lady a
 lamb, softer roll butter.”
 
“is squire?” asked grove.
 
“he is,” said don quixote.
 
“i never yet saw squire,” said grove, “who ventured to
 speak master speaking; least, mine, as
 big father, proved ever opened his
 lips speaking.”
 
“by faith then,” said sancho, “i spoken, fit speak,
 presence one much, even—but never mind—it makes it
 worse stir it.”
 
squire grove took sancho arm, saying him, “let us
 two go can talk squire style much please, and
 leave gentlemen masters fight story of
 loves; and, depend upon it, daybreak will find without
 made end it.”
 
“so means,” said sancho; “and will tell worship who
 am, may see whether reckoned among number of
 talkative squires.”
 
two squires withdrew one side, there

knights squires made two parties, telling story
 lives, others story loves; history
 relates first conversation servants, afterwards
 takes masters; says that, withdrawing little
 others, grove said sancho, “a hard life we
 lead live, señor, squires knights-errant; verily, we
 eat bread sweat faces, one curses god
 laid first parents.”
 
“it may said, too,” added sancho, “that eat chill of
 bodies; gets heat cold miserable squires
 knight-errantry? even bad something
 eat, woes lighter there’s bread; sometimes go a
 day two without breaking fast, except wind blows.”
 
“all that,” said grove, “may endured put when
 hopes reward; for, unless knight-errant serves is
 excessively unlucky, turns squire will least find
 rewarded fine government island fair
 county.”
 
“i,” said sancho, “have already told master shall content
 government island, noble generous
 promised ever many times.”
 
“i,” said grove, “shall satisfied canonry my

“your master,” said sancho, “no doubt knight church line,

“well, then, wrong there,” said grove; “for those

“in truth earnest, sir squire,” said grove, “i made

 three, like three oriental pearls.”
 
“i two,” said sancho, “that might presented pope

 god, though spite mother.”
 
“and old lady bred countess?” asked
 grove.
 
“fifteen, couple years less,” answered sancho; “but is
 tall lance, fresh april morning, strong as
 porter.”
 
“those gifts fit countess nymph of
 greenwood,” said grove; “whoreson strumpet! pith the
 rogue must have!”
 
sancho made answer, somewhat sulkily, “she’s strumpet, nor
 mother, will either be, please god, live;
 speak civilly; one bred among knights-errant, are
 courtesy itself, words don’t seem becoming.”
 
“o little know compliments, sir squire,” returned of
 grove. “what! don’t know horseman delivers good

“i disown them,” replied sancho, “and way, same

“there’s say ‘covetousness bursts bag,’” said of

“he is,” said grove, “with one casildea vandalia, rawest

“there’s road smooth hole hindrance it,”
 said sancho; “in houses cook beans, mine it’s the

“for that, brother señor,” said grove, “if blind

“by faith, brother,” said grove, “my stomach made

“well,” said sancho, “i it, grant dishonour call

“o rare wine-taster!” said grove; “nowhere else indeed does

thus innumerable achievements said don quixote now set

don quixote amazed heard knight grove, a
 thousand times point telling lied, lie
 direct already tip tongue; restrained as
 well could, order force confess lie own
 lips; said quietly, “as say, sir knight, about
 vanquished knights spain, even whole
 world, say nothing; vanquished don quixote la
 mancha consider doubtful; may resembled
 him, although like him.”
 
“how! vanquished?” said grove; “by heaven is
 us fought don quixote overcame made yield; and
 man tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs, with
 hair turning grey, aquiline nose rather hooked, large black
 drooping moustaches; battle name ‘the

saying stood laid hand sword, waiting to
 see knight grove do, equally calm voice
 said reply, “pledges don’t distress good payer; has

“i satisfied conditions terms,” replied don
 quixote; saying, betook squires
 lay, found snoring, posture when
 sleep fell upon them. roused up, bade get horses
 ready, sunrise engage bloody arduous single
 combat; intelligence sancho aghast thunderstruck,
 trembling safety master mighty deeds he
 heard squire grove ascribe his; without word
 two squires went quest cattle; time the
 three horses ass smelt one another out, all
 together.
 
way, grove said sancho, “you must know, brother,
 custom fighting men andalusia, are
 godfathers quarrel, stand idle folded arms while
 godsons fight; say remind masters are
 fighting, we, too, fight, knock one another shivers.”
 
“that custom, sir squire,” replied sancho, “may hold good among those

 squires knights-errant; least, never heard master speak

“if that’s way, heart,” said sancho, “for that

“that will do,” said other, “for must put bags, to

“body father!” said sancho, “see marten sable, pads

“still,” returned grove, “we must fight, for

“by means,” said sancho; “i going discourteous so

 fight cold blood, without anger provocation?”
 
“i can remedy entirely,” said grove, “and way:

 softly, give three four buffets, shall stretch

“to match plan,” said sancho, “i another whit

“very good,” said grove; “god will send dawn shall

now gay-plumaged birds sorts began warble trees,
 varied gladsome notes seemed welcome salute
 fresh morn beginning show beauty countenance
 gates balconies east, shaking locks a
 profusion liquid pearls; dulcet moisture bathed, the
 plants, too, seemed shed shower pearly spray, willows
 distilled sweet manna, fountains laughed, brooks babbled, the
 woods rejoiced, meadows arrayed glory
 coming. hardly light day made possible see
 distinguish things, first object presented to
 eyes sancho panza squire grove’s nose, was
 big almost overshadowed whole body. is, fact,
 stated, enormous size, hooked middle, covered
 warts, mulberry colour like egg-plant; hung down
 two fingers’ length mouth, size, colour, the
 warts, bend it, made face hideous, sancho, he
 looked him, began tremble hand foot like child in
 convulsions, vowed heart let given two
 hundred buffets, sooner provoked fight monster. don
 quixote examined adversary, found already his
 helmet visor lowered, see face; he
 observed, however, sturdily built man, tall
 stature. armour wore surcoat cassock seemed
 finest cloth gold, bespangled glittering mirrors
 like little moons, gave extremely gallant splendid
 appearance; helmet fluttered great quantity plumes,
 green, yellow, white, lance, leaning a
 tree, long stout, steel point palm
 length.
 
don quixote observed all, took note all, saw
 observed concluded said knight must man great
 strength, give way fear, like sancho
 panza; contrary, composed dauntless air, said to
 knight mirrors, “if, sir knight, great eagerness to
 fight banished courtesy, entreat to
 raise visor little, order may see comeliness of
 countenance corresponds equipment.”
 
“whether come victorious vanquished emprise, sir
 knight,” replied mirrors, “you will enough
 time leisure see me; now comply your
 request, seems serious wrong to
 fair casildea vandalia wasting time stopped raise
 visor compelling confess already aware i
 maintain.”
 
“well then,” said don quixote, “while mounting can least
 tell don quixote said vanquished.”
 
“to answer you,” said mirrors, “that like
 knight vanquished one egg like another, say
 enchanters persecute you, will venture say positively whether
 said person not.”
 
“that,” said don quixote, “is enough convince under
 deception; however, entirely relieve it, let horses be
 brought, less time take raise visor,
 god, lady, arm stand good stead, shall see your
 face, shall see vanquished don quixote you
 take be.”
 
this, cutting short colloquy, mounted, don quixote
 wheeled rocinante round order take proper distance charge
 back upon adversary, mirrors same; don
 quixote moved away twenty paces heard called by
 other, and, returning half-way, mirrors said him,
 “remember, sir knight, terms combat are, the
 vanquished, said before, shall victor’s disposal.”
 
“i aware already,” said don quixote; “provided is
 commanded imposed upon vanquished things not
 transgress limits chivalry.”
 
“that understood,” replied mirrors.
 
moment extraordinary nose squire presented to
 don quixote’s view, less amazed sancho sight;
 insomuch set monster kind, human
 new species unearthly breed. sancho, seeing master
 retiring run course, like left alone nosy
 man, fearing one flap nose battle
 left stretched ground,
 either blow fright; ran master, holding
 rocinante’s stirrup-leather, seemed time to
 turn about, said, “i implore worship, señor, turn
 charge, help cork tree, will able
 witness gallant encounter worship going with
 knight, taste better ground.”
 
“it seems rather, sancho,” said don quixote, “that thou wouldst
 mount scaffold order see bulls without danger.”
 
“to tell truth,” returned sancho, “the monstrous nose that
 squire filled fear terror, dare stay near
 him.”
 
“it is,” said don quixote, “such one it
 terrify too; so, come, will help thee thou wilt.”
 
don quixote waited sancho mount cork tree of
 mirrors took much ground considered requisite, and,
 supposing don quixote done same, without waiting any
 sound trumpet signal direct them, wheeled horse,
 agile better-looking rocinante, his
 top speed, easy trot, proceeded charge enemy;
 seeing him, however, engaged putting sancho up, drew rein, and
 halted mid career, horse grateful, was
 already unable go. don quixote, fancying foe coming
 upon flying, drove spurs vigorously rocinante’s lean
 flanks made scud along style history tells us
 occasion known make something like running,
 others simple trot him; this
 unparalleled fury bore mirrors stood digging
 spurs horse buttons, without able make him
 stir finger’s length spot come standstill
 course. lucky moment crisis, don quixote came upon
 adversary, trouble horse, embarrassed his
 lance, either manage, time lay rest.
 don quixote, however, paid attention difficulties, in
 perfect safety without risk encountered the
 mirrors force brought ground spite of
 haunches horse, heavy fall that
 lay appearance dead, stirring hand foot. instant
 sancho saw fall slid cork tree, made haste
 master was, who, dismounting rocinante, went and
 stood mirrors, unlacing helmet see was
 dead, give air happen alive, saw—who
 can say saw, without filling hear astonishment,
 wonder, awe? saw, history says, countenance, the
 face, look, physiognomy, effigy, the
 image bachelor samson carrasco! soon saw he
 called loud voice, “make haste here, sancho, behold what
 thou art see believe; quick, son, learn magic
 can do, wizards enchanters capable of.”
 
sancho came up, saw countenance bachelor
 carrasco, fell crossing thousand times, blessing
 many more. time prostrate knight showed no
 signs life, sancho said don quixote, “it opinion,
 señor, case worship take thrust sword
 mouth one looks like bachelor samson
 carrasco; perhaps will kill one enemies, the
 enchanters.”
 
“thy advice bad,” said don quixote, “for enemies fewer
 better;” drawing sword carry effect sancho’s
 counsel suggestion, squire mirrors came up, now
 without nose made hideous, cried loud
 voice, “mind about, señor don quixote; your
 friend, bachelor samson carrasco, feet, am
 squire.”
 
“and nose?” said sancho, seeing without hideous feature he
 before; replied, “i pocket,” and
 putting hand right pocket, pulled masquerade nose
 varnished pasteboard make already described; sancho,
 examining closely, exclaimed aloud voice of
 amazement, “holy mary good me! isn’t tom cecial, neighbour
 gossip?”
 
“why, sure am!” returned now unnosed squire; “tom cecial i
 am, gossip friend sancho panza; i’ll tell presently the
 means tricks falsehoods brought here; but
 meantime, beg entreat master touch, maltreat,
 wound, slay knight mirrors feet;
 because, beyond dispute, rash ill-advised bachelor
 samson carrasco, fellow townsman.”
 
moment mirrors came himself, don quixote
 perceiving it, held naked point sword face, and
 said him, “you dead man, knight, unless confess the
 peerless dulcinea toboso excels casildea vandalia in
 beauty; addition must promise, survive
 encounter fall, go city toboso present
 behalf, deal according to
 good pleasure; leaves free yours, in
 like manner return seek (for trail mighty deeds
 will serve guide lead may be), tell me
 may passed her—conditions which, in
 accordance stipulated combat, transgress
 just limits knight-errantry.”
 
“i confess,” said fallen knight, “that dirty tattered shoe of
 lady dulcinea toboso better ill-combed though clean
 beard casildea; promise go return presence
 yours, give full particular account you
 demand me.”
 
“you must also confess believe,” added don quixote, “that the
 knight vanquished don quixote la
 mancha, someone else likeness, just confess believe
 you, though seem bachelor samson carrasco, not
 so, resembling him, enemies put before
 shape, order may restrain moderate the
 vehemence wrath, make gentle use glory my
 victory.”
 
“i confess, hold, think everything believe, hold, and
 think it,” crippled knight; “let rise, entreat you; if,
 indeed, shock fall will allow me, left a
 sorry plight enough.”
 
don quixote helped rise, assistance squire tom
 cecial; sancho never took eyes, put
 questions, replies furnished clear proof was
 really truly tom cecial said; impression made on
 sancho’s mind master said enchanters having
 changed face knight mirrors bachelor
 samson carrasco, permit believe saw his
 eyes. fine, master man remained delusion; and,
 mouth, luck, mirrors squire
 parted don quixote sancho, meaning go look some
 village plaster strap ribs. don quixote and
 sancho resumed journey saragossa, history leaves
 order may tell knight mirrors his
 long-nosed squire were.

 quixote vanquished, bachelor knight command to

don quixote pursued journey high spirits, satisfaction, and

 short, said discover means, mode, or
 way disenchanting lady dulcinea, envy highest
 fortune fortunate knight-errant yore ever reached or

going along entirely absorbed fancies, sancho said
 him, “isn’t odd, señor, still eyes that
 monstrous enormous nose gossip, tom cecial?”
 
“and dost thou, then, believe, sancho,” said don quixote, “that the
 knight mirrors bachelor carrasco, squire tom
 cecial thy gossip?”
 
“i don’t know say that,” replied sancho; “all know that
 tokens gave house, wife children, nobody
 else given me; face, nose was
 off, face tom cecial, seen many time in
 town next door house; sound voice was
 just same.”
 
“let us reason matter, sancho,” said don quixote. “come now, by
 process thinking can supposed bachelor samson
 carrasco come knight-errant, arms offensive and
 defensive, fight me? ever chance enemy?
 ever given occasion owe grudge? rival,
 profess arms, envy fame acquired

“well, say, señor,” returned sancho, “about that
 knight, whoever is, like bachelor carrasco, his
 squire like gossip, tom cecial? enchantment, as
 worship says, pair world to

“it all,” said don quixote, “a scheme plot malignant

“god knows what’s truth all,” said sancho; knowing he

traveller came saluted courteously, and
 spurring mare passing without stopping, don quixote
 called him, “gallant sir, worship going our

“in truth,” replied mare, “i pass hastily
 fear horse might turn restive company mare.”
 
“you may safely hold mare, señor,” said sancho reply to
 this, “for horse virtuous well-behaved horse the

 time misbehaved, master suffered sevenfold; say
 worship may pull like; offered to
 two plates horse hanker her.”
 
traveller drew rein, amazed trim features don

 examined don quixote closely, still closely don quixote

 high-road printed thirty thousand thousands times, heaven

 single one, may tell don quixote mancha,
 otherwise called ‘the knight rueful countenance;’ though
 self-praise degrading, must perforce sound sometimes, that
 say, one hand me. that,
 gentle sir, neither horse, lance, shield, nor
 squire, arms put together, sallowness my

words don quixote held peace, and, time took
 answer, man green seemed loss reply; a
 long pause, however, said him, “you right saw
 curiosity amazement, sir knight; succeeded in
 removing astonishment feel seeing you; although say,
 señor, knowing remove it, done so;
 contrary, now know, left amazed astonished
 before. what! possible knights-errant the
 world days, histories real chivalry printed? cannot
 realise fact can anyone earth now-a-days aids
 widows, protects maidens, defends wives, succours orphans; nor

 blessed heaven! means history noble and
 genuine chivalrous deeds, say printed, countless
 stories fictitious knights-errant world filled, so
 much injury morality prejudice discredit good

“there good deal said point,” said don quixote, “as
 whether histories knights-errant fiction not.”
 
“why, anyone doubts histories false?” said
 man green.
 
“i doubt it,” said don quixote, “but never mind just now; our
 journey lasts long enough, trust god shall show worship

last observation don quixote’s, traveller began to
 suspicion crazy being, waiting him
 confirm something further; turn any
 new subject don quixote begged tell was, since he
 rendered account station life. this, in

“let kiss,” said sancho, “for think worship first

“i saint,” replied gentleman, “but great sinner; you

sancho went back regained pack-saddle, extracted laugh

 observed one things wherein ancient philosophers, who

green gaban filled astonishment don quixote’s
 argument, much began abandon notion taken
 crazy. middle discourse, being
 much taste, sancho turned aside road to
 beg little milk shepherds, milking ewes hard
 by; just gentleman, highly pleased, renew the
 conversation, don quixote, raising head, perceived cart covered
 royal flags coming along road travelling; and
 persuaded must new adventure, called aloud to
 sancho come bring helmet. sancho, hearing himself
 called, quitted shepherds, and, prodding dapple vigorously, came up
 master, fell terrific desperate adventure.

history tells don quixote called sancho bring
 helmet, sancho buying curds shepherds agreed to
 sell him, flurried great haste master not
 know carry in; so, lose
 them, already paid them, thought best throw
 master’s helmet, acting bright idea went
 see master wanted him. he, approached, exclaimed
 him:
 
“give helmet, friend, either know little of
 adventures, observe yonder one will, does, call
 upon arm myself.”
 
green gaban, hearing this, looked directions, but
 perceive nothing, except cart coming towards two or
 three small flags, led conclude must carrying
 treasure king’s, said don quixote. he, however,
 believe him, always persuaded convinced all
 happened must adventures still adventures; so
 replied gentleman, “he prepared battle half
 fought; nothing lost preparing myself, know by
 experience enemies, visible invisible, know not
 when, where, moment, shapes will attack
 me;” turning sancho, called helmet; sancho, he
 time take curds, give just was. don
 quixote took it, without perceiving thrust down
 hot haste upon head; curds pressed squeezed
 whey began run face beard, whereat so
 startled cried sancho:
 
“sancho, what’s this? think head softening, brains are
 melting, sweating head foot! sweating not
 indeed fear. convinced beyond doubt adventure
 befall terrible one. give something to
 wipe with, thou hast it, profuse sweat blinding
 me.”
 
sancho held tongue, gave cloth, gave thanks god at
 time master found matter.
 don quixote wiped himself, took helmet see it
 made head feel cool, seeing white mash
 inside helmet put nose, soon smelt it
 exclaimed:
 
“by life lady dulcinea toboso, curds thou hast
 put here, thou treacherous, impudent, ill-mannered squire!”
 
which, great composure pretended innocence, sancho replied,
 “if curds let them, worship, i’ll eat them;
 let devil eat them, must put them
 there. dare dirty helmet! guessed offender
 finely! faith, sir, light god gives me, seems must have
 enchanters too, persecute creature limb your
 worship, must put nastiness order to
 provoke patience anger, make baste ribs are
 wont do. well, time, indeed, missed aim, i
 trust master’s good sense see got curds or
 milk, anything sort; stomach i
 put helmet.”
 
“may so,” said don quixote. gentleman observing,
 astonishment, especially when, wiped himself
 clean, head, face, beard, helmet, don quixote put on, and
 settling firmly stirrups, easing sword the
 scabbard, grasping lance, cried, “now, come will, here
 i, ready try conclusions satan person!”
 
time cart flags come up, unattended anyone
 except carter mule, man sitting front. don quixote
 planted said, “whither going, brothers?
 cart this? got it? flags those?”
 
carter replied, “the cart mine; pair
 wild caged lions, governor oran sending court as
 present majesty; flags lord king’s, to
 show property.”
 
“and lions large?” asked don quixote.
 
“so large,” replied man sat door cart, “that
 larger, large, never crossed africa spain; the
 keeper, brought others, never like these. they
 male female; male first cage female in
 one behind, hungry now, eaten nothing
 to-day, let worship stand aside, must make haste the
 place feed them.”
 
hereupon, smiling slightly, don quixote exclaimed, “lion-whelps me!
 whelps lions, time! then, god! those
 gentlemen send shall see man frightened
 lions. get down, good fellow, keeper open the
 cages, turn beasts, midst plain i
 will let know don quixote mancha is, spite the
 teeth enchanters send me.”
 
“so, so,” said gentleman this; “our worthy knight has
 shown sort is; curds, doubt, softened skull
 brought brains head.”
 
instant sancho came him, saying, “señor, god’s sake
 something keep master, don quixote, tackling lions;
 they’ll tear us pieces here.”
 
“is master mad,” asked gentleman, “that believe
 afraid will engage fierce animals?”
 
“he mad,” said sancho, “but venturesome.”
 
“i will prevent it,” said gentleman; going don quixote,
 insisting upon keeper’s opening cages, said him,
 “sir knight, knights-errant attempt adventures encourage
 hope successful issue, entirely withhold it;
 valour trenches upon temerity savours rather madness than
 courage; moreover, lions come oppose you, do
 dream thing; going presents majesty,
 will right stop delay journey.”
 
“gentle sir,” replied don quixote, “you go mind tame partridge
 bold ferret, leave everyone manage business;
 mine, know whether gentlemen lions come me
 not;” turning keeper exclaimed, “by that’s
 good, sir scoundrel, don’t open cages instant,
 i’ll pin cart lance.”
 
carter, seeing determination apparition armour, said
 him, “please worship, charity’s sake, señor, let unyoke
 mules place safety along lions
 turned out; kill ruined life, for
 possess cart mules.”
 
“o man little faith,” replied don quixote, “get unyoke; you
 will soon see exerting nothing, you
 might spared trouble.”
 
carter got speed unyoked mules, the
 keeper called top voice, “i call witness
 will compulsion open cages let the
 lions loose, warn gentleman will accountable
 harm mischief beasts may do, my
 salary dues well. you, gentlemen, place safety
 open, know will harm.”
 
gentleman strove persuade don quixote a
 mad thing, tempting god engage piece folly.
 this, don quixote replied knew about. the
 gentleman return entreated reflect, knew under
 delusion.
 
“well, señor,” answered don quixote, “if like a
 spectator tragedy, opinion will be, spur your
 flea-bitten mare, place safety.”
 
hearing this, sancho tears eyes entreated give an
 enterprise compared one windmills, awful
 one fulling mills, and, fact, feats attempted
 whole course life, cakes fancy bread. “look ye,
 señor,” said sancho, “there’s enchantment here, anything the
 sort, bars chinks cage seen paw
 real lion, judging reckon lion paw could
 belong must bigger mountain.”
 
“fear rate,” replied don quixote, “will make look bigger to
 thee half world. retire, sancho, leave me; die
 thou knowest old compact; thou wilt repair dulcinea—i say
 more.” added words banished hope
 giving insane project. green gaban have
 offered resistance, found ill-matched arms, and
 think prudent come blows madman, don
 quixote now showed every respect; latter,
 renewing commands keeper repeating threats, gave
 warning gentleman spur mare, sancho dapple, the
 carter mules, striving get away cart far they
 lions broke loose. sancho weeping his
 master’s death, time firmly believed store for
 claws lions; cursed fate called it
 unlucky hour thought taking service again; but
 tears lamentations forget thrash dapple
 put good space cart. keeper,
 seeing fugitives now distance off, more
 entreated warned before; replied heard him,
 need trouble warnings or
 entreaties, fruitless, bade make haste.
 
delay occurred keeper opening first
 cage, don quixote considering whether well do
 battle foot, instead horseback, finally resolved fight
 foot, fearing rocinante might take fright sight the
 lions; therefore sprang horse, flung lance aside, braced
 buckler arm, drawing sword, advanced slowly with
 marvellous intrepidity resolute courage, plant front
 cart, commending heart god his
 lady dulcinea.
 
observed, coming passage, author of
 veracious history breaks exclamations. “o doughty don
 quixote! high-mettled past extolling! mirror, wherein heroes of
 world may see themselves! second modern don manuel leon, once
 glory honour spanish knighthood! words shall i
 describe dread exploit, language shall make credible
 ages come, eulogies unmeet thee, though they
 hyperboles piled hyperboles! foot, alone, undaunted,
 high-souled, simple sword, trenchant blade of
 perrillo brand, shield, bright polished steel one, there
 stoodst thou, biding awaiting two fiercest lions africa’s
 forests ever bred! thy deeds thy praise, valiant manchegan, and
 leave stand, wanting words wherewith glorify
 them!”

author’s outburst came end, proceeded take up
 thread story, saying keeper, seeing don
 quixote taken position, impossible him
 avoid letting male without incurring enmity fiery
 daring knight, flung open doors first cage, containing,
 said, lion, now seen enormous size,
 grim hideous mien. first thing turn round in
 cage lay, protrude claws, stretch himself
 thoroughly; next opened mouth, yawned leisurely, and
 near two palms’ length tongue thrust forth, he
 licked dust eyes washed face; done this,
 put head cage looked round eyes like
 glowing coals, spectacle demeanour strike terror temerity
 itself. don quixote merely observed steadily, longing to
 leap cart come close quarters him, hoped
 hew pieces.
 
far unparalleled madness go; noble lion, more
 courteous arrogant, troubling silly bravado,
 looked round, said, turned and
 presented hind-quarters don quixote, coolly and
 tranquilly lay cage. seeing this, don quixote ordered
 keeper take stick provoke make come out.
 
“that won’t,” said keeper; “for anger him, first he’ll
 tear pieces will myself. satisfied, sir knight, you
 done, leaves nothing said score of
 courage, seek tempt fortune second time. lion has
 door open; free come come out; has
 come far, will come to-day. worship’s great
 courage fully manifested already; brave champion, it
 strikes me, bound challenge enemy wait for
 field; adversary come, lies the
 disgrace, waits carries crown victory.”
 
“that true,” said don quixote; “close door, friend, let
 have, best form thou canst, thou hast seen do, way
 certificate; wit, thou didst open lion, i
 waited him, come out, still waited him,
 still come out, lay again. bound
 more; enchantments avaunt, god uphold right, truth,
 true chivalry! close door bade thee, make signals
 fugitives left us, may learn exploit
 thy lips.”
 
keeper obeyed, don quixote, fixing point lance
 cloth wiped face deluge curds,
 proceeded recall others, still continued fly, looking
 back every step, body, gentleman bringing rear.
 sancho, however, happening observe signal white cloth,
 exclaimed, “may die, master overcome wild beasts,
 calling us.”
 
stopped, perceived don quixote making
 signals, shaking fears extent, approached
 slowly near enough hear distinctly don quixote’s
 voice calling them. returned length cart, they
 came up, don quixote said carter, “put mules more,
 brother, continue journey; thou, sancho, give two
 gold crowns keeper, compensate delay
 incurred me.”
 
“that will give heart,” said sancho; “but become
 lions? dead alive?”
 
keeper, then, full detail, bit bit, described end of
 contest, exalting best power ability valour
 don quixote, sight lion quailed, not
 dared come cage, although held door open
 ever long; showing how, consequence represented
 knight tempting god provoke lion order to
 force out, wished done, reluctantly, and
 altogether will, allowed door closed.
 
“what dost thou think this, sancho?” said don quixote. “are there
 enchantments can prevail true valour? enchanters
 may able rob good fortune, fortitude courage
 cannot.”
 
sancho paid crowns, carter put to, keeper kissed don
 quixote’s hands bounty bestowed upon him, promised give
 account valiant exploit king himself, soon he
 saw court.
 
“then,” said don quixote, “if majesty happen ask who
 performed it, must say knight lions; desire
 name hitherto borne knight rueful
 countenance time forward changed, altered, transformed,
 turned; follow ancient usage knights-errant,
 changed names pleased, suited their
 purpose.”
 
cart went way, don quixote, sancho, green
 gaban went theirs. time, don diego miranda spoken a
 word, entirely taken observing noting don
 quixote said, opinion formed man
 brains gone mad, madman verge rationality. first
 part history yet reached him, for, read it, the
 amazement words deeds filled have
 vanished, understood nature madness;
 knowing nothing it, took rational one moment, and
 crazy next, said sensible, elegant, well
 expressed, did, absurd, rash, foolish; said to
 himself, “what madder putting helmet full curds,
 persuading oneself enchanters softening one’s skull;
 greater rashness folly wanting fight lions
 tooth nail?”
 
don quixote roused reflections soliloquy by
 saying, “no doubt, señor don diego miranda, set your
 mind fool madman, wonder did, for
 deeds argue anything else. that, you
 take notice neither mad foolish must have
 seemed you. gallant knight shows advantage bringing lance
 bear adroitly upon fierce bull eyes sovereign, in
 midst spacious plaza; knight shows advantage arrayed in
 glittering armour, pacing lists ladies joyous
 tournament, knights show advantage entertain,
 divert, and, may say so, honour courts princes by
 warlike exercises, resemble them; greater advantage than
 knight-errant show traverses deserts,
 solitudes, cross-roads, forests, mountains, quest perilous
 adventures, bent bringing happy successful issue, all
 win glorious lasting renown. greater advantage, maintain,
 knight-errant show bringing aid widow lonely
 waste, court knight dallying city damsel. all
 knights special parts play; let courtier devote
 ladies, let add lustre sovereign’s court by
 liveries, let entertain poor gentlemen sumptuous fare
 table, let arrange joustings, marshal tournaments, prove
 noble, generous, magnificent, good
 christian, will fulfil duties especially
 his; let knight-errant explore corners earth and
 penetrate intricate labyrinths, step let attempt
 impossibilities, desolate heaths let endure burning rays of
 midsummer sun, bitter inclemency winter winds and
 frosts; let lions daunt him, monsters terrify him, dragons
 make quail; seek these, attack those, vanquish
 all, truth main duties. i, then, fallen lot
 member knight-errantry, avoid attempting to
 seems come within sphere duties; thus bounden
 duty attack lions just now attacked, although knew it
 height rashness; know well valour is, it
 virtue occupies place two vicious extremes,
 cowardice temerity; will lesser evil is
 valiant rise till reaches point rashness, sink
 reaches point cowardice; for, easier the
 prodigal miser become generous, easier a
 rash man prove truly valiant coward rise true
 valour; believe me, señor don diego, attempting adventures is
 better lose card many card few; hear
 said, ‘such knight rash daring,’ sounds better ‘such a
 knight timid cowardly.’”
 
“i protest, señor don quixote,” said don diego, “everything have
 said done proved correct test reason itself; i
 believe, laws ordinances knight-errantry lost,
 might found worship’s breast proper
 depository muniment-house; let us make haste, reach my
 village, shall take rest late exertions; if
 body spirit, these
 sometimes tend produce bodily fatigue.”
 
“i take invitation great favour honour, señor don diego,”
 replied don quixote; pressing forward better pace before,
 two afternoon reached village house don
 diego, or, don quixote called him, “the knight green gaban.”

student poet, don diego’s son, come mother to
 receive him, heard exclamation, mother were
 filled amazement extraordinary figure presented; he,
 however, dismounting rocinante, advanced great politeness to
 ask permission kiss lady’s hand, don diego said, “señora,
 pray receive wonted kindness señor don quixote mancha,
 see you, knight-errant, bravest wisest in
 world.”
 
lady, whose name doña christina, received every sign
 good-will great courtesy, don quixote placed her
 service abundance well-chosen polished phrases. almost
 civilities exchanged student, who
 listening don quixote, took sensible, clear-headed
 person.
 
author describes minutely everything belonging don diego’s
 mansion, putting us picture whole contents rich
 gentleman-farmer’s house; translator history thought it
 best pass details sort silence,
 harmony main purpose story, the
 strong point truth rather dull digressions.
 
led don quixote room, sancho removed armour,
 leaving loose walloon breeches chamois-leather doublet, all
 stained rust armour; collar falling one of
 scholastic cut, without starch lace, buskins buff-coloured, and
 shoes polished. wore good sword, hung baldric of
 sea-wolf’s skin, suffered many years, say, an
 ailment kidneys; threw long cloak good grey
 cloth. first all, five six buckets water (for as
 regard number buckets dispute), washed head
 face, still water remained whey-coloured, thanks to
 sancho’s greediness purchase unlucky curds turned his
 master white. thus arrayed, easy, sprightly, gallant
 air, don quixote passed another room, student was
 waiting entertain table laid; the
 arrival distinguished guest, doña christina anxious show
 knew able give becoming reception those
 came house.
 
don quixote taking armour, don lorenzo (for don
 diego’s called) took opportunity say father,
 “what make gentleman brought home us,
 sir? name, appearance, describing a
 knight-errant completely puzzled mother me.”
 
“i don’t know say, son,” replied. don diego; “all can tell
 thee seen act acts greatest madman the
 world, heard make observations sensible efface and
 undo does; thou talk feel pulse wits,
 thou art shrewd, form reasonable conclusion thou canst
 wisdom folly; though, tell truth, more
 inclined take mad sane.”
 
don lorenzo went away entertain don quixote been
 said, course conversation passed them
 don quixote said don lorenzo, “your father, señor don diego de
 miranda, told rare abilities subtle intellect you
 possess, and, all, great poet.”
 
“a poet, may be,” replied don lorenzo, “but great one, no
 means. true somewhat given poetry reading
 good poets, much justify title ‘great’ which
 father gives me.”
 
“i dislike modesty,” said don quixote; “for no
 poet conceited think best poet the
 world.”
 
“there rule without exception,” said don lorenzo; “there may
 poets yet think are.”
 
“very few,” said don quixote; “but tell me, verses which
 now hand, father tells keep somewhat
 restless absorbed? gloss, know something about
 glosses, like hear them; poetical
 tournament, contrive carry second prize; first
 always goes favour personal standing, second simple
 justice; third comes second, first,
 reckoning way, will third, way licentiate
 degrees conferred universities; but, that, title
 first great distinction.”
 
“so far,” said don lorenzo himself, “i take a
 madman; let us go on.” said him, “your worship has
 apparently attended schools; sciences studied?”
 
“that knight-errantry,” said don quixote, “which good that
 poetry, even finger two it.”
 
“i know science is,” said don lorenzo, “and now
 never heard it.”
 
“it science,” said don quixote, “that comprehends or
 sciences world, professes must a
 jurist, must know rules justice, distributive equitable,
 give one belongs due him. he
 must theologian, able give clear distinctive
 reason christian faith professes, wherever may asked
 him. must physician, herbalist, in

 turn occasion will present him; and, putting it
 aside must adorned virtues, cardinal and
 theological, come minor particulars, must, say, able

 goes; must know shoe horse, repair saddle and
 bridle; and, return higher matters, must faithful god
 lady; must pure thought, decorous words,
 generous works, valiant deeds, patient suffering,
 compassionate towards needy, and, lastly, upholder truth
 though defence cost life. qualities,
 great small, true knight-errant made up; judge then, señor don
 lorenzo, whether contemptible science knight who
 studies professes learn, whether may compare
 loftiest taught schools.”
 
“if so,” replied don lorenzo, “this science, protest,
 surpasses all.”
 
“how, so?” said don quixote.
 
“what mean say,” said don lorenzo, “is, doubt whether there
 now, ever were, knights-errant, adorned such
 virtues.”
 
“many time,” replied don quixote, “have said now say once
 more, majority world opinion never
 knights-errant it; opinion that, unless
 heaven miracle brings home truth were

 often proved me), will now stop disabuse error
 share multitude. shall pray heaven to
 deliver it, show beneficial necessary
 knights-errant days yore, useful in
 days vogue; now, sins people,
 sloth indolence, gluttony luxury triumphant.”
 
“our guest broken hands,” said don lorenzo at
 point; “but, that, glorious madman, should
 dull blockhead doubt it.”
 
here, summoned dinner, brought colloquy close.
 don diego asked able make the
 wits guest. replied, “all doctors clever
 scribes world will make sense scrawl madness;
 madman full streaks, full lucid intervals.”
 
went dinner, repast don diego said on
 road habit giving guests, neat, plentiful,
 tasty; pleased don quixote marvellous silence
 reigned throughout house, like carthusian
 monastery.
 
cloth removed, grace said hands washed, don
 quixote earnestly pressed don lorenzo repeat verses for
 poetical tournament, replied, “not like those
 poets who, asked recite verses, refuse, when
 asked vomit up, will repeat gloss, for
 expect prize, composed merely an
 exercise ingenuity.”
 
“a discerning friend mine,” said don quixote, “was opinion that
 one waste labour glossing verses; reason gave
 gloss can never come text, often or
 frequently wanders away meaning purpose aimed at
 glossed lines; besides, laws gloss too
 strict, allow interrogations, ‘said he,’ ‘i
 say,’ turning verbs nouns, altering construction, not
 speak restrictions limitations fetter
 gloss-writers, doubt know.”
 
“verily, señor don quixote,” said don lorenzo, “i wish catch
 worship tripping stretch, cannot, slip through
 fingers like eel.”
 
“i don’t understand say, mean slipping,” said don
 quixote.
 
“i will explain another time,” said don lorenzo; “for the
 present pray attend glossed verses gloss, run
 thus:

don lorenzo finished reciting gloss, don quixote stood up,
 loud voice, almost shout, exclaimed grasped don
 lorenzo’s right hand his, “by highest heavens, noble youth, but
 best poet earth, deserve crowned laurel,

need say don lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself
 praised don quixote, albeit looked upon madman? power of
 flattery, far-reaching art thou, wide bounds thy
 pleasant jurisdiction! don lorenzo gave proof it, complied
 don quixote’s request entreaty, repeated this
 sonnet fable story pyramus thisbe.
 
sonnet

“blessed god,” said don quixote heard don lorenzo’s
 sonnet, “that among hosts irritable poets found
 one consummate one, which, señor, art sonnet proves me
 are!”
 
four days don quixote sumptuously entertained don
 diego’s house, end time asked permission to
 depart, telling thanked kindness hospitality he
 received house, that, become

don diego commended laudable resolution, bade him
 furnish wanted house belongings, as
 gladly service him; which, indeed, his
 personal worth honourable profession made incumbent upon them.
 
day departure came length, welcome don quixote as
 sad sorrowful sancho panza, well satisfied
 abundance don diego’s house, objected return the
 starvation woods wilds short-commons his
 ill-stocked alforjas; these, however, filled packed he
 considered needful. taking leave, don quixote said don lorenzo,
 “i know whether told already, tell you
 more, wish spare fatigue toil in

 nothing turn aside somewhat narrow path of
 poetry take still narrower one knight-errantry, wide enough,
 however, make emperor twinkling eye.”
 
speech don quixote wound evidence madness, but
 still better added said, “god knows, gladly

father amazed afresh strange medley don
 quixote talked, one moment sense, another nonsense, the

“for excellence alone,” said don quixote this, “the youth
 deserves marry, merely fair quiteria, queen guinevere
 herself, alive now, spite launcelot would

“say wife,” said sancho, now listened in
 silence, “for won’t hear anything one marrying his
 equal, holding proverb ‘each ewe like.’ would
 like good basilio (for beginning take fancy to
 already) marry lady quiteria; blessing good
 luck—i meant say opposite—on people prevent who
 love one another marrying.”
 
“if love one another marry,” said don quixote,
 “it deprive parents right choose, marry their
 children proper person proper time; was
 left daughters choose husbands pleased, one for
 choosing father’s servant, another, someone seen

“god will guide better,” said sancho, “for god gives wound

“what art thou driving at, sancho? curses thee!” said don quixote;
 “for thou takest stringing proverbs sayings together, no
 one can understand thee judas himself, wish thee. tell
 me, thou animal, dost thou know nails wheels, anything

“oh, don’t understand me,” replied sancho, “it wonder my
 words taken nonsense; matter; understand myself, i
 know said anything foolish said; only
 worship, señor, always gravelling everything say, nay,

“cavilling, gravelling,” said don quixote, “thou prevaricator of

“don’t find fault me, worship,” returned sancho, “for you
 know bred court trained salamanca, know

 comes, don’t mistake, quarter arcade steam and
 smell great deal like fried rashers galingale thyme; a
 wedding begins smells like that, faith, be
 plentiful unstinting.”
 
“have done, thou glutton,” said don quixote; “come, let us go and
 witness bridal, see rejected basilio does.”
 
“let likes,” returned sancho; “be poor, would
 marry quiteria. make grand match himself, without a
 farthing; nothing else? faith, señor, it’s opinion poor
 man content can get, go looking for

 accomplishments can’t turned money, let count dirlos have

“for god’s sake, sancho,” said don quixote here, “stop harangue;
 belief, thou wert allowed continue thou beginnest
 every instant, thou wouldst time left eating sleeping;
 thou wouldst spend talking.”
 
“if worship good memory,” replied sancho, “you would
 remember articles agreement started home this

 long neighbour worship’s authority;
 far, seems me, broken said article.”
 
“i remember article, sancho,” said don quixote; “and even it
 so, desire hold tongue come along; the

sancho fared thus, don quixote watching entrance, one

 trappings number little bells attached petrals, who,
 marshalled regular order, ran one several courses the

hearing this, don quixote said himself, “it easy see these
 folk never seen dulcinea toboso; would

shortly this, several bands dancers various sorts began to

 sword-dancers composed four-and-twenty lads gallant and

don quixote asked one nymphs composed and
 arranged it. replied beneficiary town had
 nice taste devising things sort. “i will lay wager,” said
 don quixote, “that bachelor beneficiary greater friend
 camacho’s basilio’s, better satire at
 vespers; introduced accomplishments basilio the
 riches camacho neatly dance.” sancho panza, was
 listening this, exclaimed, “the king cock; stick to
 camacho.” “it easy see thou art clown, sancho,” said don
 quixote, “and one sort cry ‘long life conqueror.’”
 
“i don’t know sort am,” returned sancho, “but know very
 well i’ll never get elegant skimmings basilio’s pots these
 got camacho’s;” showed bucketful geese and
 hens, seizing one began eat great gaiety appetite,
 saying, “a fig accomplishments basilio! much thou hast
 much art thou worth, much thou art worth much hast

 bountiful skimmings whose pots geese hens, hares and
 rabbits; basilio’s, ever come hand, even foot,

“hast thou finished thy harangue, sancho?” said don quixote. “of course
 finished it,” replied sancho, “because see worship takes
 offence it; that, work enough cut
 three days.”
 
“god grant may see thee dumb die, sancho,” said don quixote.
 
“at rate going,” said sancho, “i’ll chewing clay before
 worship dies; then, maybe, i’ll dumb i’ll say a
 word end world, or, least, till day of
 judgment.”
 
“even happen, sancho,” said don quixote, “thy silence
 will never come thou hast talked, art talking, wilt talk

 will come thine; never expect see thee dumb, even
 thou art drinking sleeping, utmost can say.”
 
“in good faith, señor,” replied sancho, “there’s trusting that
 fleshless one, mean death, devours lamb soon sheep,

 “he preaches well lives well,” said sancho, “and know more

don quixote sancho engaged discussion set forth
 last chapter, heard loud shouts great noise, were
 uttered made men mares went full gallop,
 shouting, receive bride bridegroom, approaching
 musical instruments pageantry sorts around them, and
 accompanied priest relatives both, most
 distinguished people surrounding villages. sancho saw the
 bride, exclaimed, “by faith, dressed like country
 girl, like fine court lady; egad, well can make out,
 patena wears rich coral, green cuenca stuff is
 thirty-pile velvet; white linen trimming—by oath, but
 it’s satin! look hands—jet rings them! may never luck
 they’re gold rings, real gold, set pearls white
 curdled milk, every one worth eye one’s head!
 whoreson baggage, hair has! it’s wig, never saw
 longer fairer days life. see bravely bears
 herself—and shape! wouldn’t say like walking palm
 tree loaded clusters dates? trinkets hanging
 hair neck look just like them. swear heart is
 brave lass, fit ‘to pass banks flanders.’”
 
don quixote laughed sancho’s boorish eulogies thought that,
 saving lady dulcinea toboso, never seen beautiful
 woman. fair quiteria appeared somewhat pale, was, doubt,
 bad night brides always pass dressing for
 wedding morrow. advanced towards theatre stood
 one side meadow decked carpets boughs, they
 plight troth, behold the
 dances plays; moment arrival spot they
 heard loud outcry behind them, voice exclaiming, “wait a
 little, ye, inconsiderate ye hasty!” words all
 turned round, perceived speaker man clad what
 seemed loose black coat garnished crimson patches like
 flames. crowned (as presently seen) crown gloomy
 cypress, hand held long staff. approached was
 recognised everyone gay basilio, waited anxiously to
 see come words, dread catastrophe in
 consequence appearance moment. came last
 weary breathless, planting front bridal pair,
 drove staff, steel spike end, ground,
 and, pale face eyes fixed quiteria, thus addressed her
 hoarse, trembling voice:
 
“well dost thou know, ungrateful quiteria, according holy
 law acknowledge, long live thou canst take husband; art
 thou ignorant either that, hopes time exertions
 improve fortunes, never failed observe respect
 due thy honour; thou, casting behind thee thou owest my
 true love, wouldst surrender mine another whose wealth
 serves bring good fortune supreme happiness; and
 now complete (not think deserves it, inasmuch as
 heaven pleased bestow upon him), will, hands, do
 away obstacle may interfere it, remove myself
 you. long live rich camacho! many happy year may he
 live ungrateful quiteria! let poor basilio die,
 basilio whose poverty clipped wings happiness, brought
 grave!”
 
saying, seized staff driven ground, and
 leaving one half fixed there, showed sheath that
 concealed tolerably long rapier; and, may called hilt
 planted ground, swiftly, coolly, deliberately threw
 upon it, instant bloody point half steel
 blade appeared back, unhappy man falling earth bathed
 blood, transfixed weapon.
 
friends ran aid, filled grief misery and
 sad fate, don quixote, dismounting rocinante, hastened to
 support him, took arms, found yet ceased
 breathe. draw rapier, priest who
 standing objected withdrawn confessed
 him, instant withdrawal death.
 basilio, however, reviving slightly, said weak voice, though in
 pain, “if thou wouldst consent, cruel quiteria, give thy hand as
 bride last fatal moment, might still hope rashness
 find pardon, means attained bliss being
 thine.”
 
hearing priest bade think welfare soul
 rather cravings body, earnestness implore
 god’s pardon sins rash resolve; basilio
 replied determined confess unless quiteria first
 gave hand marriage, happiness compose his
 mind give courage make confession.
 
don quixote hearing wounded man’s entreaty, exclaimed aloud that
 basilio asked just reasonable, moreover request that
 might easily complied with; much señor
 camacho’s honour receive lady quiteria widow brave
 basilio received direct father.
 
“in case,” said he, “it will say ‘yes,’ no
 consequences can follow utterance word, nuptial
 couch marriage must grave.”
 
camacho listening this, perplexed bewildered not
 knowing say do; urgent entreaties of
 basilio’s friends, imploring allow quiteria give her
 hand, soul, quitting life despair, be
 lost, moved, nay, forced him, say quiteria were
 willing give satisfied, putting the
 fulfillment wishes moment. assailed quiteria
 pressed her, prayers, others tears, others
 persuasive arguments, give hand poor basilio; she,

 unwilling utter word, given reply not

fair quiteria, appearance distressed, grieved, and
 repentant, advanced without word basilio lay, eyes
 already turned head, breathing short painful, murmuring
 name quiteria teeth, apparently die
 like heathen like christian. quiteria approached him, and
 kneeling, demanded hand signs without speaking. basilio opened
 eyes gazing fixedly her, said, “o quiteria, hast thou
 turned compassionate moment thy compassion will serve a
 dagger rob life, now strength left either
 bear happiness thou givest accepting thine, to
 suppress pain rapidly drawing dread shadow death
 eyes? entreat thee, thou fatal star me, that
 hand thou demandest wouldst give me, given of
 complaisance deceive afresh, thou confess declare
 without constraint upon thy will thou givest to
 thy lawful husband; meet thou shouldst trifle with
 moment this, recourse falsehoods one
 dealt truly thee.”
 
uttering words showed weakness bystanders
 expected return faintness take life it. then
 quiteria, overcome modesty shame, holding right hand
 hand basilio, said, “no force bend will; freely,
 therefore, possible so, give thee hand a
 lawful wife, take thine thou givest thine free
 will, untroubled unaffected calamity thy hasty act has
 brought upon thee.”
 
“yes, give it,” said basilio, “not agitated distracted, with
 unclouded reason heaven pleased grant me, thus give
 thy husband.”
 
“and give thy wife,” said quiteria, “whether thou livest
 many years, carry thee arms grave.”
 
“for one badly wounded,” observed sancho point, “this young
 man great deal say; make leave billing and
 cooing, attend soul; thinking on
 tongue teeth.”
 
basilio quiteria thus joined hands, priest, deeply moved
 tears eyes, pronounced blessing upon them, and
 implored heaven grant easy passage soul newly
 wedded man, who, instant received blessing, started nimbly
 feet unparalleled effrontery pulled rapier that
 sheathed body. bystanders astounded, and
 some, simple inquiring, began shouting, “a miracle, a
 miracle!” basilio replied, “no miracle, miracle; trick, a
 trick!” priest, perplexed amazed, made haste examine the
 wound hands, found blade passed, through
 basilio’s flesh ribs, hollow iron tube full blood,
 adroitly fixed place, blood, afterwards
 ascertained, prepared congeal. short, the
 priest camacho present saw tricked and
 made fools of. bride showed signs displeasure the
 deception; contrary, hearing say marriage, being
 fraudulent, valid, said confirmed afresh,
 whence concluded affair planned agreement
 understanding pair, whereat camacho supporters
 mortified proceeded revenge by
 violence, great number drawing swords attacked
 basilio, whose protection many swords instant
 unsheathed, don quixote taking lead horseback, his
 lance arm well covered shield, made give way
 him. sancho, never found pleasure enjoyment such
 doings, retreated wine-jars taken his
 delectable skimmings, considering that, holy place, spot
 respected.
 
“hold, sirs, hold!” cried don quixote loud voice; “we no
 right take vengeance wrongs love may us: remember
 love war thing, war allowable and
 common make use wiles stratagems overcome enemy, in
 contests rivalries love tricks devices employed to
 attain desired end justifiable, provided the
 discredit dishonour loved object. quiteria belonged to
 basilio basilio quiteria just beneficent disposal of
 heaven. camacho rich, can purchase pleasure when, where, and
 pleases him. basilio ewe-lamb, one, however
 powerful may be, shall take him; two god hath

 dexterously overawed know him.

 pacified tranquillised, prove put swords again,
 inveighing pliancy quiteria rather craftiness
 basilio; camacho maintaining that, quiteria maiden such

camacho following, therefore, consoled and
 pacified, basilio’s side appeased; rich camacho,
 show felt resentment trick, care

 take part it, withdrew basilio’s village; for

 quixote, regarding man worth stout one. sancho alone
 cloud soul, found debarred waiting for
 camacho’s splendid feast festival, lasted night; and
 thus dragged away, moodily followed master, accompanied
 basilio’s party, left behind flesh-pots egypt; though in
 heart took him, now nearly finished

 so, vexed dejected though hungry, without dismounting from

sancho muttered somewhat aloud, master overheard him, and
 asked, “what art thou muttering there, sancho?”
 
“i’m saying anything muttering anything,” said sancho; “i was
 saying wish heard worship has
 said just now married; perhaps i’d say now, ‘the ox that’s
 loose licks well.’”
 
“is thy teresa bad then, sancho?”
 
“she bad,” replied sancho; “but good; at
 least good wish.”
 
“thou dost wrong, sancho,” said don quixote, “to speak ill thy wife;
 mother thy children.” “we quits,”
 returned sancho; “for speaks ill whenever takes into
 head, especially jealous; satan not
 put then.”
 
fine, remained three days newly married couple, by
 entertained treated like kings. don quixote begged
 fencing licentiate find guide show way the
 cave montesinos, great desire enter see with
 eyes wonderful tales told the
 country true. licentiate said get cousin his
 own, famous scholar, one much given reading books of
 chivalry, great pleasure conducting mouth
 cave, show lakes ruidera, were
 likewise famous mancha, even spain; he
 assured find entertaining, youth who
 write books good enough printed dedicated princes.
 cousin arrived last, leading ass foal, pack-saddle
 covered parti-coloured carpet sackcloth; sancho saddled
 rocinante, got dapple ready, stocked alforjas, along which
 went cousin, likewise well filled; so, commending
 god bidding farewell all, set out, taking the
 road famous cave montesinos.
 
way don quixote asked cousin sort character his
 pursuits, avocations, studies were, replied was
 profession humanist, pursuits studies making
 books press, great utility less entertainment to
 nation. one called “the book liveries,” he
 described seven hundred three liveries, colours,
 mottoes, ciphers, gentlemen court might pick and
 choose fancied festivals revels, without go
 a-begging anyone, puzzling brains, saying
 is, appropriate objects purposes; “for,” said
 he, “i give jealous, rejected, forgotten, absent, what

sancho, attentive cousin’s words, said him,
 “tell me, señor—and god give luck printing books—can you
 tell (for course know, know everything) the
 first man scratched head? thinking must been
 father adam.”
 
“so must,” replied cousin; “for doubt adam a
 head hair; first man world have
 scratched sometimes.”
 
“so think,” said sancho; “but now tell me, first tumbler

“really, brother,” answered cousin, “i moment say
 positively without investigated it; will look go
 back books, will satisfy next time we
 meet, will last time.”
 
“look here, señor,” said sancho, “don’t give trouble about
 it, just minute hit upon asked you. first
 tumbler world, must know, lucifer, cast or
 pitched heaven; came tumbling bottomless
 pit.”
 
“you right, friend,” said cousin; said don quixote,
 “sancho, question answer thine own; thou hast heard
 someone else.”
 
“hold peace, señor,” said sancho; “faith, take asking
 questions answering, i’ll go till to-morrow morning.
 nay! ask foolish things answer nonsense needn’t go looking for
 help neighbours.”
 
“thou hast said thou art aware of, sancho,” said don quixote;
 “for weary learning proving
 things that, known proved, worth farthing
 understanding memory.”
 
pleasant conversation day went by, night
 put small hamlet whence two leagues

 bent upon entering it, requisite to
 provide ropes, might tied lowered into
 depths. don quixote said even reached bottomless

coming within sight cousin, sancho, don quixote

 him, “mind about, master mine; don’t go burying

“tie hold thy peace,” said don quixote, “for emprise like

 hundred eyes everything within there; perhaps may some
 things put book ‘transformations.’”
 
“the drum hands will know beat well enough,” said
 sancho panza.

 found asleep thoroughly awake. nevertheless, felt my
 head breast satisfy whether there
 empty delusive phantom; touch, feeling, collected

 sight stately royal palace castle, walls seemed
 built clear transparent crystal; two great doors that
 opened wide therein, saw coming forth advancing towards a
 venerable old man, clad long gown mulberry-coloured serge that
 trailed upon ground. shoulders breast green

“that poniard must made ramon hoces sevillian,”

“i understand, señor don quixote,” remarked cousin here,
 “how worship, short space time have

“how long since went down?” asked don quixote.
 
“little better hour,” replied sancho.
 
“that be,” returned don quixote, “because night overtook me

 cousin.
 
“i never touched morsel,” answered don quixote, “nor feel

“and enchanted eat?” said cousin.
 
“they neither eat,” said don quixote; “nor subject the

“and enchanted sleep, now, señor?” asked sancho.
 
“certainly not,” replied don quixote; “at least, three

“don’t wait that,” said don quixote; “i’ll help everything,”
 did, sifting barley cleaning manger;
 degree humility made feel bound tell a
 good grace asked; seating bench, don
 quixote beside him, cousin, page, sancho panza, the
 landlord, senate audience, began story way:
 
“you must know village four leagues half inn,

 ‘it’s excellent plan, declare, gossip, worthy great

 ‘if abbot sings well, acolyte much behind him.’ they
 returned disconsolate hoarse village, told
 friends, neighbours, acquaintances befallen in

 villages neighbourhood; devil, never sleeps, with
 love sowing dissensions scattering discord everywhere,

 two leagues away ours, one persecute us most; and
 may turn well prepared bought lances and
 halberds seen. curious things told had
 tell, don’t think so, got others;” and
 worthy fellow brought story close.
 
just moment came gate inn man entirely
 clad chamois leather, hose, breeches, doublet, said a
 loud voice, “señor host, room? here’s divining ape the
 show release melisendra just coming.”
 
“ods body!” said landlord, “why, it’s master pedro! we’re a
 grand night!” forgot mention said master pedro his
 left eye nearly half cheek covered patch green
 taffety, showing something ailed side. “your worship is
 welcome, master pedro,” continued landlord; “but ape
 show, don’t see them?” “they close hand,” said he
 chamois leather, “but came first know any
 room.” “i’d make duke alva clear make room for
 master pedro,” said landlord; “bring ape show;
 there’s company inn to-night will pay see the
 cleverness ape.” “so means,” said man the
 patch; “i’ll lower price, well satisfied pay my
 expenses; now i’ll go back hurry cart ape and
 show;” went inn.
 
don quixote asked landlord master pedro was, and
 show ape him; the
 landlord replied, “this famous puppet-showman, time
 past going mancha aragon, exhibiting show of
 release melisendra famous don gaiferos, one best
 best-represented stories seen part the
 kingdom many year; also ape most
 extraordinary gift ever seen ape imagined human being;
 ask anything, listens attentively question,
 jumps master’s shoulder, pressing close ear
 tells answer master pedro delivers. says great
 deal things past things come; though he
 always hit truth every case, times far
 wrong, makes us fancy got devil him. gets
 two reals every question ape answers; mean master
 answers whispered ear; is
 believed master pedro rich. ‘gallant
 man’ say italy, good company, leads finest life
 world; talks six, drinks dozen, by
 tongue, ape, show.”
 
master pedro now came back, cart followed show the
 ape—a big one, without tail buttocks bare felt, but
 vicious-looking. soon don quixote saw him, asked him, “can
 tell me, sir fortune-teller, fish catch, will it
 us? see, two reals,” bade sancho give them
 master pedro; answered ape said, “señor, this
 animal give answer information touching things are
 come; things past knows something, less things
 present.”
 
“gad,” said sancho, “i give farthing told what’s past
 me, knows better myself? pay for
 told know mighty foolish. know things
 present, two reals, tell me, excellent sir ape,
 wife teresa panza now, diverting
 with?”
 
master pedro refused take money, saying, “i will receive
 payment advance service first rendered;” and
 right hand gave couple slaps left
 shoulder, one spring ape perched upon it, and
 putting mouth master’s ear began chattering teeth
 rapidly; kept long one saying a
 credo, another spring brought ground, the
 instant master pedro ran great haste fell upon knees
 don quixote, embracing legs exclaimed, “these legs i
 embrace embrace two pillars hercules, illustrious
 reviver knight-errantry, long consigned oblivion! never yet
 duly extolled knight, don quixote mancha, courage the
 faint-hearted, prop tottering, arm fallen, staff and
 counsel unfortunate!”

don quixote thunderstruck, sancho astounded, cousin staggered,
 page astonished, man braying town agape, landlord
 perplexity, and, short, everyone amazed words the
 puppet-showman, went say, “and thou, worthy sancho panza, the
 best squire squire best knight world! good
 cheer, thy good wife teresa well, moment
 hackling pound flax; token left hand a
 jug broken spout holds good drop wine, she
 solaces work.”
 
“that can well believe,” said sancho. “she lucky one, it
 jealousy change giantess
 andandona, master’s account clever worthy
 woman; teresa one won’t let want for
 anything, though heirs may pay it.”
 
“now declare,” said don quixote, “he reads much travels much
 sees knows great deal. say amount persuasion
 persuaded apes world can
 divine seen now eyes? don
 quixote mancha worthy animal refers to, though gone
 rather far praise; whatever may be, thank heaven that
 endowed tender compassionate heart, always
 disposed good harm none.”
 
“if money,” said page, “i ask señor ape will
 happen peregrination making.”
 
master pedro, time risen don quixote’s
 feet, replied, “i already said little beast gives no
 answer future; did, money no
 consequence, oblige señor don quixote, present, would
 give profits world. now, promised
 it, afford pleasure, will set show offer
 entertainment inn, without charge whatever.”
 soon heard this, landlord, delighted beyond measure,
 pointed place show might fixed, done at
 once.
 
don quixote well satisfied divinations the
 ape, think proper ape divine anything,
 either past future; master pedro arranging show, he
 retired sancho corner stable, where, without being
 overheard anyone, said him, “look here, sancho, been
 seriously thinking ape’s extraordinary gift, come to
 conclusion beyond doubt master pedro, master, a
 pact, tacit express, devil.”
 
“if packet express devil,” said sancho, “it must a
 dirty packet doubt; good can master pedro to
 packets?”
 
“thou dost understand me, sancho,” said don quixote; “i mean
 must made compact devil infuse power into
 ape, may get living, grown rich he
 will give soul, enemy mankind wants; this
 led believe observing ape answers things
 past present, devil’s knowledge extends further; the
 future knows guesswork, always; is
 reserved god alone know times seasons, him
 neither past future; present. is,
 clear ape speaks spirit devil; am
 astonished denounced holy office, put him

 saturday; things turned out, two days bitch died

“still,” said sancho, “i glad worship make
 master pedro ask ape whether happened worship cave
 montesinos true; for, begging worship’s pardon, i, my
 part, take flam lies, rate something
 dreamt.”
 
“that may be,” replied don quixote; “however, will you
 suggest; though scruples it.”
 
point master pedro came quest don quixote, tell him
 show now ready come see it, worth seeing.
 don quixote explained wish, begged ask ape once
 tell whether certain things happened the
 cave montesinos dreams realities, appeared
 partake both. upon master pedro, without answering, went
 back fetch ape, and, placed front don quixote
 sancho, said: “see here, señor ape, gentleman wishes know
 whether certain things happened cave called the
 cave montesinos false true.” making usual sign
 ape mounted left shoulder seemed whisper ear,
 master pedro said once, “the ape says things saw or
 happened cave are, part false, part true;
 knows regards question; but
 worship wishes know more, friday next will answer all
 may asked him, virtue present exhausted, will
 return till friday, said.”
 
“did say, señor,” said sancho, “that bring to
 believe worship said adventures cave was
 true, even half it?”
 
“the course events will tell, sancho,” replied don quixote; “time,
 discloses things, leaves nothing drag into
 light day, though buried bosom earth. but
 enough present; let us go see master pedro’s show,
 sure must something novel it.”
 
“something!” said master pedro; “this show mine sixty thousand
 novel things it; let tell you, señor don quixote, one of
 best-worth-seeing things world day; _operibus
 credite et non verbis_, now let’s get work, growing
 late, great deal say show.”

 said master pedro within, “boy, stick text the
 gentleman bids you; it’s best plan; keep plain song, and

“nay, nay,” said don quixote this; “on point bells

don quixote, however, seeing swarm moors hearing a
 din, thought right aid fugitives, standing he
 exclaimed loud voice, “never, live, will permit foul
 play practised presence famous knight and
 fearless lover don gaiferos. halt! ill-born rabble, follow not
 pursue him, ye will reckon battle!” and
 suiting action word, drew sword, one bound
 placed close show, unexampled rapidity fury
 began shower blows puppet troop moors, knocking over
 some, decapitating others, maiming one demolishing that; and
 among many delivered one stroke which, master pedro had
 ducked, made small, got way, have
 sliced head easily made almond-paste.
 master pedro kept shouting, “hold hard! señor don quixote! can’t you
 see they’re real moors you’re knocking killing and
 destroying, little pasteboard figures! look—sinner i
 am!—how you’re wrecking ruining i’m worth!” spite
 this, don quixote leave discharging continuous rain of
 cuts, slashes, downstrokes, backstrokes, length, less
 space two credos, brought whole show ground,
 fittings figures shivered knocked pieces, king
 marsilio badly wounded, emperor charlemagne crown and
 head split two. whole audience thrown confusion, the
 ape fled roof inn, cousin frightened, even
 sancho panza mighty fear, for, swore the
 storm over, never seen master furious passion.
 
complete destruction show thus accomplished, don
 quixote became little calmer, said, “i wish now
 will believe useful knights-errant are
 world; just think, present, would
 become brave don gaiferos fair melisendra! depend
 upon it, time dogs overtaken and
 inflicted outrage upon them. so, then, long live knight-errantry
 beyond everything living earth day!”
 
“let live, welcome,” said master pedro feeble
 voice, “and let die, unfortunate can say with
 king don rodrigo—
 
yesterday lord spain
 to-day i’ve turret left
 may call mine own.
 

half hour, nay, barely minute ago, saw lord kings
 emperors, stables filled countless horses, my
 trunks bags gay dresses unnumbered; now find myself
 ruined laid low, destitute beggar, without my

 caught; reckless fury sir knight here, who,
 say, protects fatherless, rights wrongs, other
 charitable deeds; whose generous intentions found wanting
 case only, blessed praised highest heavens! verily,
 knight rueful figure must disfigured mine.”
 
sancho panza touched master pedro’s words, said him,
 “don’t weep lament, master pedro; break heart; let tell
 master, don quixote, catholic scrupulous christian
 that, can make done wrong, will own
 it, willing pay make good, something over
 above.”
 
“only let señor don quixote pay part work has
 destroyed,” said master pedro, “and content, worship
 ease conscience, saved keeps is
 another’s owner’s will, makes restitution.”
 
“that true,” said don quixote; “but present aware i
 got anything yours, master pedro.”
 
“what!” returned master pedro; “and relics lying bare
 hard ground—what scattered shattered invincible
 strength mighty arm? whose bodies belonged to
 mine? get living them?”
 
“now fully convinced,” said don quixote, “of many a
 time believed; enchanters persecute nothing

 gentlemen now hear me, everything taken place

 result opposite intended, fault of
 mine, wicked beings persecute me; but, that,
 willing condemn costs error mine, though
 proceed malice; let master pedro see wants for
 spoiled figures, agree pay good current
 money castile.”
 
master pedro made bow, saying, “i expected less rare
 christianity valiant don quixote mancha, true helper and
 protector destitute needy vagabonds; master landlord here
 great sancho panza shall arbitrators appraisers
 worship dilapidated figures worth
 may worth.”
 
landlord sancho consented, master pedro picked from
 ground king marsilio saragossa head off, said,
 “here see impossible restore king former
 state, think, saving better judgments, death,
 decease, demise, four reals half may given me.”
 
“proceed,” said don quixote.
 
“well then, cleavage top bottom,” continued master
 pedro, taking split emperor charlemagne, “it much
 ask five reals quarter.”
 
“it’s little,” said sancho.
 
“nor much,” said landlord; “make even, say five
 reals.”
 
“let whole five quarter,” said don quixote; “for the
 sum total notable disaster stand quarter or
 less; make end quickly, master pedro, it’s getting on
 supper-time, hints hunger.”
 
“for figure,” said master pedro, “that without nose, and
 wants eye, fair melisendra, ask, reasonable in
 charge, two reals twelve maravedis.”
 
“the devil must it,” said don quixote, “if melisendra and
 husband time least french border, the
 horse rode seemed fly rather gallop; you
 needn’t try sell cat hare, showing noseless
 melisendra now, may be, enjoying ease with
 husband france. god help every one own, master pedro, and
 let us proceed fairly honestly; now go on.”
 
master pedro, perceiving don quixote beginning wander, and
 return original fancy, disposed let escape, he
 said him, “this melisendra, must one damsels
 waited her; i’m given sixty maravedis her, i’ll be
 content sufficiently paid.”
 
went on, putting values ever many smashed figures,
 which, two arbitrators adjusted satisfaction
 parties, came forty reals three-quarters; and
 sum, sancho disbursed, master pedro asked for
 two reals trouble catching ape.
 
“let them, sancho,” said don quixote; “not catch ape,
 get drunk; two hundred give minute good
 news, anyone tell positively, lady doña
 melisandra señor don gaiferos now france own
 people.”
 
“no one tell us better ape,” said master pedro; “but
 there’s devil catch now; suspect, however, that
 affection hunger will drive come looking to-night;
 to-morrow will soon shall see.”
 
short, puppet-show storm passed off, supped peace and
 good fellowship don quixote’s expense, height of
 generosity. daylight man lances halberds
 took departure, soon daybreak cousin page
 came bid don quixote farewell, former returning home, latter
 resuming journey, towards which, help him, don quixote gave him
 twelve reals. master pedro care engage palaver
 don quixote, knew right well; rose sun,
 got together remains show caught ape, he
 went seek adventures. landlord, know don
 quixote, much astonished mad freaks generosity.
 conclude, sancho, master’s orders, paid liberally,
 taking leave quitted inn eight the
 morning took road, will leave pursue their
 journey, necessary order allow certain matters

don quixote stopped take breath, and, observing silence was
 still preserved, mind continue discourse, have
 done sancho interposed smartness; he, seeing

thus proceeding, then, discovered small boat,

 seeing nobody, once, without ado, dismounted rocinante

 reason sudden dismounting tying. don quixote made answer,
 “thou must know, sancho, bark plainly, without the

 god’s hand guide us; hold back from

“as that’s case,” said sancho, “and worship chooses give in

“i don’t understand logiquous,” said sancho, “nor ever

“longinquous,” replied don quixote, “means far off; wonder
 thou dost understand it, thou art bound know latin, like

“now tied,” said sancho; “what next?”
 
“what?” said don quixote, “cross weigh anchor; mean,

 angrily, “what art thou afraid of, cowardly creature? art thou

“and come line worship speaks of,” said sancho,
 “how far shall gone?”
 
“very far,” said don quixote, “for three hundred sixty

 greatest cosmographer known, shall travelled one-half when

“by god,” said sancho, “your worship gives nice authority what

don quixote laughed interpretation sancho put upon “computed,”

“try test told thee of, sancho,” said don quixote, “and don’t

sancho felt, passing hand gently carefully the

“why, so?” asked don quixote; “hast thou come upon aught?”
 
“ay, aughts,” replied sancho; shaking fingers washed his
 whole hand river along boat quietly gliding in
 midstream, moved occult intelligence invisible enchanter,
 simply current, just smooth gentle.
 
now came sight large water mills stood the
 middle river, instant don quixote saw cried out,
 “seest thou there, friend? stands castle fortress,

 infanta, princess, whose aid brought hither.”
 
“what devil city, fortress, castle worship talking
 about, señor?” said sancho; “don’t see mills that
 stand river grind corn?”
 
“hold thy peace, sancho,” said don quixote; “though look like
 mills so; already told thee enchantments

time, boat, reached middle stream, began
 move less slowly hitherto. millers belonging mills,
 saw boat coming river, point being

“did tell thee, sancho,” said don quixote this, “that had

“what persons castle art thou talking of, madman? art thou for

“that’s enough,” said don quixote himself, “it preaching in

 quixote, “cannot unfortunate, even fall stopped short
 depths bottomless pit, glory seen you
 lifted delivered it. squire, god’s
 curse upon him, better unloosing tongue talking
 impertinence tightening girths saddle keep it
 steady; however may be, fallen raised up, foot on
 horseback, shall always service lady the
 duchess, worthy consort, worthy queen beauty paramount
 princess courtesy.”
 
“gently, señor don quixote mancha,” said duke; “where lady
 doña dulcinea toboso is, right beauties should
 praised.”
 
sancho, time released entanglement, standing by,
 master answer said, “there denying, and
 must maintained, lady dulcinea toboso very
 beautiful; hare jumps one least expects it; have
 heard say call nature like potter makes vessels
 clay, makes one fair vessel can well make two, or
 three, hundred; say because, faith, lady duchess
 way behind mistress lady dulcinea toboso.”
 
don quixote turned duchess said, “your highness may conceive
 never knight-errant world talkative a
 droller squire have, will prove truth say,
 highness pleased accept services days.”
 
duchess made answer, “that worthy sancho droll i
 consider good thing, sign shrewd; for
 drollery sprightliness, señor don quixote, well know,
 take abode dull wits; good sancho droll
 sprightly set shrewd.”
 
“and talkative,” added don quixote.
 
“so much better,” said duke, “for many droll things be
 said words; lose time talking, come, great knight
 rueful countenance—”
 
“of lions, highness must say,” said sancho, “for no
 rueful countenance character now.”
 
“he lions it,” continued duke; “i say, let sir knight of
 lions come castle mine close by, shall given
 reception due exalted personage, the
 duchess wont give knights-errant come there.”
 
time sancho fixed girthed rocinante’s saddle, don
 quixote got back duke mounted fine horse, they
 placed duchess middle set castle. the
 duchess desired sancho come side, found infinite
 enjoyment listening shrewd remarks. sancho required no
 pressing, pushed duke, thought
 rare good fortune receive knight-errant homely
 squire castle.

don quixote obeyed, great bandying compliments followed between
 two matter; end duchess’s determination
 carried day, refused get dismount her
 palfrey except arms duke, saying consider
 worthy impose unnecessary burden great knight.
 length duke came take down, entered a
 spacious court two fair damsels came forward threw don
 quixote’s shoulders large mantle finest scarlet cloth, at
 instant galleries court lined the
 men-servants women-servants household, crying, “welcome,
 flower cream knight-errantry!” flung
 pellets filled scented water don quixote duke and
 duchess; don quixote greatly astonished, was
 first time thoroughly felt believed a
 knight-errant reality merely fancy, now saw
 treated way read knights being
 treated days yore.
 
sancho, deserting dapple, hung duchess entered the
 castle, feeling twinges conscience left ass
 alone, approached respectable duenna come the
 rest receive duchess, low voice said her, “señora
 gonzalez, however grace may called—”
 
“i called doña rodriguez grijalba,” replied duenna; “what is
 will, brother?” sancho made answer, “i glad if
 worship favour go castle gate, where
 will find grey ass mine; make them, please, put in
 stable, put yourself, poor little beast is
 rather easily frightened, bear alone all.”
 
“if master wise man,” said duenna, “we got a
 fine bargain. you, brother, bad luck who
 brought here; go, look ass, we, duennas this
 house, used work sort.”
 
“well then, troth,” returned sancho, “i heard master, is
 treasure-finder stories, telling story lancelot when
 came britain, say ladies waited upon duennas upon
 hack; and, comes ass, wouldn’t change señor
 lancelot’s hack.”
 
“if jester, brother,” said duenna, “keep drolleries
 place they’ll pass muster paid for; you’ll
 get nothing fig.”
 
“at rate, will ripe one,” said sancho, “for won’t
 lose trick years point little.”
 
“son bitch,” said duenna, aglow anger, “whether i’m
 old not, it’s god reckon, you, you
 garlic-stuffed scoundrel!” said loud, duchess
 heard it, turning round seeing duenna state of
 excitement, eyes flaming so, asked wrangling with.
 
“with good fellow here,” said duenna, “who particularly
 requested go put ass castle gate
 stable, holding example the
 don’t know where—that ladies waited one lancelot, and
 duennas hack; more, wind with, called me
 old.”
 
“that,” said duchess, “i considered greatest
 affront offered me;” addressing sancho, said to
 him, “you must know, friend sancho, doña rodriguez very
 youthful, wears hood authority custom’s
 sake years.”
 
“may rest mine unlucky,” said sancho, “if meant that
 way; spoke affection ass great,
 thought commend kind-hearted person
 lady doña rodriguez.”
 
don quixote, listening, said him, “is proper
 conversation place, sancho?”
 
“señor,” replied sancho, “every one must mention wants wherever
 may be; thought dapple here, spoke here; had
 thought stable spoken there.”
 
duke observed, “sancho quite right, no
 reason find fault him; dapple shall fed his
 heart’s content, sancho may rest easy, shall treated like
 himself.”
 
conversation, amusing except don quixote, was
 proceeding, ascended staircase ushered don quixote a
 chamber hung rich cloth gold brocade; six damsels relieved
 armour waited like pages, prepared
 instructed duke duchess do, and
 treat don quixote, might see believe
 treating like knight-errant. armour was
 removed, stood don quixote tight-fitting breeches and
 chamois doublet, lean, lanky, long, cheeks seemed be
 kissing inside; figure, damsels waiting
 taken care check merriment (which one of
 particular directions master mistress given them),
 burst laughter. asked let be
 stripped might put shirt him, any
 account, saying modesty became knights-errant just much as
 valour. however, said might give shirt sancho; and
 shutting room sumptuous bed,
 undressed put shirt; then, finding alone with
 sancho, said him, “tell me, thou new-fledged buffoon old
 booby, dost thou think right offend insult duenna so
 deserving reverence respect one just now? a
 time bethink thee thy dapple, noble personages
 likely let beasts fare badly treat owners in
 elegant style? god’s sake, sancho, restrain thyself, don’t
 show thread let see coarse, boorish texture
 thou art of. remember, sinner thou art, master more
 esteemed respectable well-bred servants are; that
 one greatest advantages princes men that
 servants good wait them. dost thou not
 see—shortsighted thou art, unlucky mortal i
 am!—that perceive thee coarse clown dull
 blockhead, will suspect impostor swindler? nay,
 nay, sancho friend, keep clear, oh, keep clear these
 stumbling-blocks; falls way chatterbox
 droll, drops wretched buffoon first time trips;
 bridle thy tongue, consider weigh thy words escape thy
 mouth, bear mind now quarters whence, god’s help,
 strength arm, shall come forth mightily advanced in
 fame fortune.”
 
sancho promised much earnestness keep mouth shut, and
 bite tongue uttered word altogether
 purpose well considered, told might make mind
 easy point, never discovered what
 were.
 
don quixote dressed himself, put baldric sword, threw
 scarlet mantle shoulders, placed head montera of
 green satin damsels given him, thus arrayed passed out
 large room, found damsels drawn double
 file, number side, appliances washing
 hands, presented profuse obeisances and
 ceremonies. came twelve pages, together seneschal, to
 lead dinner, hosts already waiting him. they
 placed midst them, much pomp stateliness
 conducted another room, sumptuous table
 laid four covers. duchess duke came the
 door room receive him, grave ecclesiastic,
 one rule noblemen’s houses; one who, being
 born magnates themselves, never know teach to
 behave such; one greatness great folk
 measured narrowness mind; one who, they
 try introduce economy household rule, lead into
 meanness. one sort, say, must grave churchman
 came duke duchess receive don quixote.
 
vast number polite speeches exchanged, length, taking
 don quixote them, proceeded sit table. duke
 pressed don quixote take head table, and, though he
 refused, entreaties duke urgent to
 accept it.
 
ecclesiastic took seat opposite him, duke and
 duchess sides. time sancho stood by, gaping with
 amazement honour saw shown master illustrious
 persons; observing ceremonious pressing passed
 duke don quixote induce take seat the
 head table, said, “if worship will give leave will
 tell story happened village matter of
 seats.”
 
moment sancho said don quixote trembled, making sure he
 say something foolish. sancho glanced him, guessing
 thoughts, said, “don’t afraid going astray, señor, or
 saying anything won’t pat purpose; haven’t forgotten
 advice worship gave just now talking much little,
 well ill.”
 
“i recollection anything, sancho,” said don quixote; “say
 thou wilt, say quickly.”
 
“well then,” said sancho, “what going say true my
 master don quixote, present, will keep lying.”
 
“lie much thou wilt care, sancho,” said don quixote,
 “for going stop thee, consider thou art going to
 say.”
 
“i considered reconsidered,” said sancho, “that the
 bell-ringer’s safe berth; will seen follows.”
 
“it well,” said don quixote, “if highnesses order
 turn idiot, will talk heap nonsense.”
 
“by life duke, sancho shall taken away a
 moment,” said duchess; “i fond him, know is
 discreet.”
 
“discreet days holiness,” said sancho, “for good
 opinion wit, though there’s none me; story i
 want tell this. invitation given gentleman of
 town, rich one, one quality, one the
 alamos medina campo, married doña mencia quiñones, the
 daughter don alonso marañon, knight order santiago,

 best belief, tomasillo scapegrace, of
 balbastro smith, wounded in.—isn’t true, master mine?
 live, say so, gentlefolk may take some
 lying chatterer.”
 
“so far,” said ecclesiastic, “i take chatterer
 liar; don’t know shall take by-and-by.”
 
“thou citest many witnesses proofs, sancho,” said don quixote,
 “that choice say thou must telling truth; go
 on, cut story short, thou art taking way make an
 end two days come.”
 
“he cut short,” said duchess; “on contrary, my
 gratification, tell knows it, though not
 finish six days; took many me
 pleasantest ever spent.”
 
“well then, sirs, say,” continued sancho, “that gentleman,
 know well hands, it’s bowshot from
 house his, invited poor respectable labourer—”
 
“get on, brother,” said churchman; “at rate going you
 will stop story short next world.”
 
“i’ll stop less half-way, please god,” said sancho; “and say
 labourer, coming house gentleman spoke that
 invited him—rest soul, now dead; token died
 death angel, say; there, just at
 time gone reap tembleque—”
 
“as live, son,” said churchman, “make haste back from
 tembleque, finish story without burying gentleman, unless
 want make funerals.”
 
“well then, happened,” said sancho, “that pair them
 going sit table—and think can see now plainer
 ever—”
 
great enjoyment duke duchess derived the
 irritation worthy churchman showed long-winded, halting way
 sancho telling story, don quixote chafing with
 rage vexation.
 
“so, saying,” continued sancho, “as pair were
 going sit table, said, labourer insisted upon the
 gentleman’s taking head table, gentleman insisted
 upon labourer’s taking it, orders obeyed his
 house; labourer, plumed politeness good
 breeding, account, gentleman, of
 patience, putting hands shoulders, compelled force to
 sit down, saying, ‘sit down, stupid lout, wherever sit will
 head you; that’s story, and, troth, think hasn’t
 brought amiss here.”
 
don quixote turned colours, which, sunburnt face, mottled it
 till looked like jasper. duke duchess suppressed their
 laughter altogether mortify don quixote, saw
 sancho’s impertinence; change conversation, keep
 sancho uttering absurdities, duchess asked don quixote
 news lady dulcinea, sent any
 presents giants miscreants lately, have
 vanquished good many.
 
don quixote replied, “señora, misfortunes, though had
 beginning, will never end. vanquished giants i
 sent caitiffs miscreants; find her
 enchanted turned ill-favoured peasant wench
 can imagined?”
 
“i don’t know,” said sancho panza; “to seems fairest
 creature world; rate, nimbleness jumping won’t
 give tumbler; faith, señora duchess, leaps the
 ground back ass like cat.”
 
“have seen enchanted, sancho?” asked duke.
 
“what, seen her!” said sancho; “why, devil myself
 first thought enchantment business? much
 enchanted father.”
 
ecclesiastic, heard talking giants caitiffs and
 enchantments, began suspect must don quixote la
 mancha, whose story duke always reading; himself
 often reproved it, telling foolish read such
 fooleries; becoming convinced suspicion correct,
 addressing duke, said angrily him, “señor, your
 excellence will give account god good man
 does. don quixote, don simpleton, whatever name is,
 cannot, imagine, blockhead excellence have
 him, holding encouragement go vagaries and
 follies.” turning address don quixote said, “and you,
 num-skull, put head knight-errant, and
 vanquish giants capture miscreants? go ways good hour,
 good hour said you. go home bring your
 children any, attend business, give over
 going wandering world, gaping making laughing-stock of
 know don’t. where, heaven’s
 name, discovered ever knights-errant?

 enchanted dulcineas, rest silly things tell
 you?”
 
don quixote listened attentively reverend gentleman’s words, and
 soon perceived done speaking, regardless the
 presence duke duchess, sprang feet angry
 looks agitated countenance, said—but reply deserves a
 chapter itself.

“good, god!” cried sancho; “say defence, master
 mine, there’s nothing world said, thought, or
 insisted on; besides, gentleman denies, has, that
 ever knights-errant world, any
 wonder knows nothing talking about?”
 
“perhaps, brother,” said ecclesiastic, “you sancho panza
 mentioned, master promised island?”
 
“yes, am,” said sancho, “and what’s more, one deserves as
 much anyone; one sort—‘attach thyself good, and
 thou wilt one them,’ those, ‘not thou art bred,

 tree, good shade covers him;’ leant upon good master, i

“no, sancho friend, certainly not,” said duke, “for name
 señor don quixote confer upon government one no
 small importance disposal.”
 
“go thy knees, sancho,” said don quixote, “and kiss feet of
 excellence favour bestowed upon thee.”
 
sancho obeyed, seeing ecclesiastic stood table
 completely temper, exclaiming, “by gown wear, almost
 inclined say excellence great fool these
 sinners. wonder mad, people senses
 sanction madness! leave excellence them, long
 house, will remain own, spare the
 trouble reproving remedy;” without uttering
 another word, eating another morsel, went off, entreaties of
 duke duchess entirely unavailing stop him; that
 duke said much him, not, laughter
 uncalled-for anger provoked.
 
done laughing, said don quixote, “you replied on
 behalf stoutly, sir knight lions, no
 occasion seek satisfaction this, which, though may
 look like offence, all, for, women can give no
 offence, can ecclesiastics, well know.”
 
“that true,” said don quixote, “and reason is, is
 liable offence give offence anyone. women, children,
 ecclesiastics, defend themselves, though may
 receive offence insulted, offence the
 insult is, excellence well knows, difference:
 insult comes one capable offering it, so,
 maintains it; offence may come quarter without
 carrying insult. take example: man standing unsuspectingly
 street ten others come armed beat him; draws his
 sword quits like man, number antagonists
 makes impossible effect purpose avenge himself;
 man suffers offence insult. another example will
 make thing plain: man standing back turned,
 another comes strikes him, striking takes to
 flight, without waiting instant, pursues does
 overtake him; received blow received offence, not
 insult, insult must maintained. struck him,
 though sneakingly treacherously, drawn sword and
 stood faced him, struck received
 offence insult time; offence struck
 treacherously, insult struck maintained had
 done, standing ground without taking flight. so, according
 laws accursed duel, may received offence, not
 insult, neither women children can maintain it, can they
 wound, way standing ground, just
 connected religion; three sorts of
 persons without arms offensive defensive, so, though
 naturally bound defend themselves, right to
 offend anybody; though said just now might received
 offence, say now certainly not, receive insult
 can still less give one; reasons feel, do
 feel, aggrieved good man said me; wish had
 stayed little longer, might shown mistake he
 makes supposing maintaining never have
 knights-errant world; amadis his
 countless descendants heard say much, sure not
 gone well worship.”
 
“i will take oath that,” said sancho; “they given him
 slash slit top toe like a
 pomegranate ripe melon; likely fellows put with
 jokes sort! faith, i’m certain reinaldos montalvan
 heard little man’s words given spank
 mouth wouldn’t spoken next three years; ay,
 let tackle them, he’ll see he’ll get hands!”
 
duchess, listened sancho, ready die laughter,
 mind set droller madder his
 master; good many just same
 opinion.
 
don quixote finally grew calm, dinner came end, the
 cloth removed four damsels came in, one silver
 basin, another jug also silver, third two fine white
 towels shoulder, fourth arms bared the
 elbows, white hands (for white certainly were) round
 ball naples soap. one basin approached, arch
 composure impudence, thrust don quixote’s chin, who,
 wondering ceremony, said never word, supposing the
 custom country wash beards instead hands; therefore
 stretched far could, instant jug
 began pour damsel soap rubbed beard briskly,
 raising snow-flakes, soap lather less white, only
 beard, face, eyes the
 submissive knight, perforce obliged keep shut. the
 duke duchess, known anything this, waited see
 came strange washing. barber damsel, him
 hand’s breadth deep lather, pretended more
 water, bade one jug go fetch some, señor don
 quixote waited. so, don quixote left strangest and
 ludicrous figure imagined. present, and
 good many, watching him, saw there
 half yard neck, uncommonly brown, eyes shut, and
 beard full soap, great wonder, great
 discretion, able restrain laughter. the
 damsels, concocters joke, kept eyes down, daring
 look master mistress; them, laughter and
 anger struggled within them, knew do, whether to
 punish audacity girls, reward amusement
 received seeing don quixote plight.
 
length damsel jug returned made end of
 washing don quixote, one carried towels very
 deliberately wiped dried him; four together making him
 profound obeisance curtsey, go, duke,
 lest don quixote see joke, called one
 basin saying, “come wash me, take care is
 water enough.” girl, sharp-witted prompt, came placed the
 basin duke done don quixote, soon had
 well soaped washed, wiped dry made their
 obeisance retired. appeared afterwards duke sworn
 washed don quixote have
 punished impudence, adroitly atoned by
 soaping well.
 
sancho observed ceremony washing attentively, said
 himself, “god bless me, custom country
 wash squires’ beards well knights’. god upon my
 soul want badly; gave scrape razor besides
 i’d take still greater kindness.”
 
“what saying yourself, sancho?” asked duchess.
 
“i saying, señora,” replied, “that courts other
 princes, cloth taken away, always heard say they
 give water hands, lye beard; shows it
 good live long may see much; sure, say too
 lives long life must undergo much evil, though undergo
 washing sort pleasure rather pain.”
 
“don’t uneasy, friend sancho,” said duchess; “i will take care
 damsels wash you, even put tub necessary.”
 
“i’ll content beard,” said sancho, “at rate the
 present; future, god decreed be.”
 
“attend worthy sancho’s request, seneschal,” said duchess, “and
 exactly wishes.”
 
seneschal replied señor sancho obeyed everything;
 went away dinner took sancho along him,
 duke duchess don quixote remained table discussing
 great variety things, bearing calling arms and
 knight-errantry.
 
duchess begged don quixote, seemed retentive
 memory, describe portray beauty features the
 lady dulcinea toboso, for, judging fame trumpeted abroad of
 beauty, felt sure must fairest creature the
 world, nay, mancha.
 
don quixote sighed hearing duchess’s request, said, “if i
 pluck heart, lay plate table here
 highness’s eyes, spare tongue pain of
 telling can hardly thought of, excellence would
 see portrayed full. attempt depict and
 describe detail, feature feature, beauty peerless
 dulcinea, burden one worthy shoulders mine, an
 enterprise wherein pencils parrhasius, timantes, apelles,
 graver lysippus employed, paint in
 pictures carve marble bronze, ciceronian and
 demosthenian eloquence sound praises?”
 
“what demosthenian mean, señor don quixote?” said duchess; “it
 word never heard life.”
 
“demosthenian eloquence,” said don quixote, “means eloquence of
 demosthenes, ciceronian means cicero, two most
 eloquent orators world.”
 
“true,” said duke; “you must lost wits ask a
 question. nevertheless, señor don quixote greatly gratify us if
 depict us; never fear, even outline sketch
 will something make fairest envious.”
 
“i certainly,” said don quixote, “had blurred
 mind’s eye misfortune fell upon short time
 since, one nature ready weep than
 describe it. highnesses must know that, going days
 back kiss hands receive benediction, approbation, and
 permission third sally, found altogether different
 one sought; found enchanted changed a
 princess peasant, fair foul, angel devil,
 fragrant pestiferous, refined clownish, a
 dignified lady jumping tomboy, and, word, dulcinea del
 toboso coarse sayago wench.”
 
“god bless me!” said duke aloud this, “who can done the
 world injury? can robbed beauty that
 gladdened it, grace gaiety charmed it, modesty
 shed lustre upon it?”
 
“who?” replied don quixote; “who malignant
 enchanter many persecute envy—that accursed race
 born world obscure bring naught achievements of
 good, glorify exalt deeds wicked? enchanters
 persecuted me, enchanters persecute still, enchanters will
 continue persecute sunk lofty chivalry
 deep abyss oblivion; injure wound they
 know feel most. deprive knight-errant lady to
 deprive eyes sees with, sun gives light,
 food whereby lives. many time said it, i
 say now more, knight-errant without lady like tree
 without leaves, building without foundation, shadow without
 body causes it.”
 
“there denying it,” said duchess; “but still, to
 believe history don quixote come lately with
 general applause, inferred it, mistake not, that
 never saw lady dulcinea, said lady nothing in
 world imaginary lady, one begot gave
 birth brain, adorned whatever charms and
 perfections chose.”
 
“there good deal said point,” said don quixote; “god
 knows whether dulcinea world, whether she
 imaginary imaginary; things proof must
 pushed extreme lengths. begotten given birth
 lady, though behold needs must be, lady who
 contains qualities make famous throughout the
 world, beautiful without blemish, dignified without haughtiness, tender
 yet modest, gracious courtesy courteous good
 breeding, lastly, exalted lineage, beauty shines forth
 excels higher degree perfection upon good blood in
 fair lowly birth.”
 
“that true,” said duke; “but señor don quixote will give me
 leave say constrained say story exploits
 read, inferred that, granting there
 dulcinea toboso, it, the
 highest degree beautiful described us, regards
 loftiness lineage par orianas,
 alastrajareas, madasimas, others sort, whom, you
 well know, histories abound.”
 
“to may reply,” said don quixote, “that dulcinea daughter
 works, virtues rectify blood, lowly virtue
 regarded esteemed exalted vice. dulcinea,
 besides, within may raise crowned and
 sceptred queen; merit fair virtuous woman capable
 performing greater miracles; virtually, though formally, she
 higher fortunes.”
 
“i protest, señor don quixote,” said duchess, “that say,
 go cautiously lead hand, saying is; henceforth i

 advantage island govern.”
 
duke, duchess, don quixote reached point their
 conversation, heard voices great hubbub palace,
 sancho burst abruptly room glowing anger, a
 straining-cloth way bib, followed several servants, or,
 properly speaking, kitchen-boys underlings, one whom
 carried small trough full water, colour impurity
 plainly dishwater. one trough pursued followed
 everywhere went, endeavouring utmost persistence to
 thrust chin, another kitchen-boy seemed anxious to
 wash beard.
 
“what this, brothers?” asked duchess. “what it? do
 want good man? forget governor-elect?”
 
barber kitchen-boy replied, “the gentleman will let
 washed customary, lord señor his
 master been.”
 
“yes, will,” said sancho, great rage; “but i’d like be
 cleaner towels, clearer lye, dirty hands; there’s
 much difference master be
 washed angels’ water devil’s lye. customs of
 countries princes’ palaces good long give no
 annoyance; way washing worse doing
 penance. clean beard, don’t require refreshed in
 fashion, whoever comes wash touch hair head,
 mean say beard, due respect said, i’ll give him
 punch will leave fist sunk skull; cirimonies and
 soapings sort like jokes polite attentions of
 one’s host.”
 
duchess ready die laughter saw sancho’s rage
 heard words; pleasure don quixote see him
 sorry trim, dingy towel him, the
 hangers-on kitchen round him; making low bow the
 duke duchess, ask permission speak, addressed
 rout dignified tone: “holloa, gentlemen! let youth
 alone, go back came from, anywhere else you
 like; squire clean person, troughs are
 bad narrow thin-necked jars him; take advice leave him
 alone, neither understand joking.”
 
sancho took word mouth went on, “nay, let come
 try jokes country bumpkin, it’s likely
 i’ll stand it’s now midnight! let bring comb
 here, please, curry beard mine, they
 get anything offends cleanliness, let clip
 skin.”
 
upon this, duchess, laughing while, said, “sancho panza is
 right, always will says; clean, and, says
 himself, require washed; ways not
 please him, free choose. besides, promoters cleanliness
 excessively careless thoughtless, don’t know ought
 say audacious, bring troughs wooden utensils kitchen
 dishclouts, instead basins jugs pure gold towels of
 holland, person beard; but, all, are
 ill-conditioned ill-bred, spiteful are, help
 showing grudge squires knights-errant.”
 
impudent servitors, even seneschal came them, took
 duchess speaking earnest, removed the
 straining-cloth sancho’s neck, something like shame and
 confusion face went left him; whereupon he,
 seeing safe extreme danger, seemed him,
 ran fell knees duchess, saying, “from great
 ladies great favours may looked for; grace done
 to-day requited less wishing dubbed a
 knight-errant, devote days life service
 exalted lady. labouring man, name sancho panza, i
 married, children, serving squire; any
 one ways can serve highness, will longer in
 obeying grace commanding.”
 
“it easy see, sancho,” replied duchess, “that have
 learned polite school politeness itself; mean say
 easy see nursed bosom señor don
 quixote, is, course, cream good breeding flower of

 master servant, one cynosure of
 knight-errantry, star squirely fidelity! rise, sancho,
 friend; will repay courtesy taking care lord the
 duke makes good promised gift government soon as
 possible.”
 
this, conversation came end, don quixote retired to
 take midday sleep; duchess begged sancho, unless a
 great desire go sleep, come spend afternoon with
 damsels cool chamber. sancho replied that, though
 certainly habit sleeping four five hours heat
 day summer, serve excellence try his
 might sleep even one day, come in
 obedience command, went off. duke gave
 fresh orders respect treating don quixote knight-errant,
 without departing even smallest particular style which,
 stories tell us, used treat knights old.

duchess begged tell enchantment deception,
 sancho told whole story exactly happened, his

 said, “in consequence worthy sancho told me, doubt starts

duchess help laughing simplicity duenna, or

“you right, sancho,” said duchess, “for one born ready

“all that’s possible,” said sancho panza; “and now i’m willing to

“that true,” said duchess; “but tell me, sancho, this

sancho upon related her, word word, said
 already touching adventure, heard duchess said,
 “from occurrence may inferred that, great don quixote

great pleasure duke duchess took conversation of
 don quixote sancho panza; and, bent ever upon plan
 practising jokes upon look
 appearance adventures, took basis action what
 don quixote already told cave montesinos, in
 order play famous one. duchess marvelled above
 sancho’s simplicity great make him
 believe absolute truth dulcinea enchanted, was
 enchanter trickster business.
 having, therefore, instructed servants everything to
 do, six days afterwards took hunt, great a
 retinue huntsmen beaters crowned king.
 
presented don quixote hunting suit, sancho another
 finest green cloth; don quixote declined put on,
 saying must soon return hard pursuit arms, could
 carry wardrobes stores him. sancho, however, took they
 gave him, meaning sell first opportunity.
 
appointed day arrived, don quixote armed himself, sancho
 arrayed himself, mounted dapple (for give him
 though offered horse), placed midst of
 troop huntsmen. duchess came splendidly attired, don
 quixote, pure courtesy politeness, held rein palfrey,
 though duke wanted allow him; last reached a
 wood lay two high mountains, where, occupying
 various posts, ambushes, paths, distributing party in
 different positions, hunt began great noise, shouting, and
 hallooing, that, baying hounds blowing of
 horns, hear one another. duchess dismounted, and
 sharp boar-spear hand posted knew the
 wild boars habit passing. duke don quixote
 likewise dismounted placed one side her.
 sancho took position rear without dismounting from
 dapple, dared desert lest mischief befall him.
 scarcely taken stand line several their
 servants, saw huge boar, closely pressed hounds and
 followed huntsmen, making towards them, grinding teeth and
 tusks, scattering foam mouth. soon saw don
 quixote, bracing shield arm, drawing sword, advanced
 meet him; duke boar-spear same; duchess
 gone front duke prevented her.
 sancho alone, deserting dapple sight mighty beast, took
 heels hard strove vain mount tall
 oak. clinging branch, however, half-way his
 struggle reach top, bough, ill-luck hard
 fate, gave way, caught fall broken limb oak, he
 hung suspended air unable reach ground. finding himself
 position, green coat beginning tear, and
 reflecting fierce animal came way might able to
 get him, began utter cries, call help so
 earnestly, heard see felt sure must
 teeth wild beast. end tusked boar fell
 pierced blades many spears held front him; and
 don quixote, turning round cries sancho, knew them
 he, saw hanging oak head downwards, with
 dapple, forsake distress, close beside him; and
 cide hamete observes seldom saw sancho panza without seeing
 dapple, dapple without seeing sancho panza; their
 attachment loyalty one other. don quixote went and
 unhooked sancho, who, soon found ground, looked
 rent huntingcoat grieved heart, he
 thought got patrimonial estate suit.
 
meanwhile slung mighty boar across back mule, and
 covered sprigs rosemary branches myrtle, they
 bore away spoils victory large field-tents which
 pitched middle wood, found tables
 laid dinner served, grand sumptuous style was
 easy see rank magnificence provided it.
 sancho, showed rents torn suit duchess,
 observed, “if hunting hares, small birds, coat
 safe plight it’s in; don’t know
 pleasure one can find lying wait animal may take
 life tusk gets you. recollect heard an
 old ballad sung says,
 
bears thou devoured, erst
 famous favila.”
 

“that,” said don quixote, “was gothic king, who, going a-hunting, was
 devoured bear.”
 
“just so,” said sancho; “and kings princes expose
 dangers sake pleasure which, my
 mind, one, consists killing animal has
 done harm whatever.”
 
“quite contrary, sancho; wrong there,” said duke; “for
 hunting suitable requisite kings princes for
 anybody else. chase emblem war; stratagems, wiles,
 crafty devices overcoming enemy safety; extreme
 cold intolerable heat borne, indolence sleep are
 despised, bodily powers invigorated, limbs who
 engages made supple, and, word, pursuit which
 may followed without injury anyone enjoyment many;
 best is, everybody, field-sports of
 sorts are, except hawking, also kings great
 lords. reconsider opinion therefore, sancho, are
 governor take hunting, will find good it.”
 
“nay,” said sancho, “the good governor broken leg and
 keep home;” nice thing if, people at
 trouble coming look business, governor to
 away forest enjoying himself; government go on
 badly fashion. faith, señor, hunting amusements are
 fit idlers governors; intend amuse myself
 playing fours eastertime, bowls sundays and
 holidays; huntings don’t suit condition agree my
 conscience.”
 
“god grant may turn so,” said duke; “because it’s long
 step saying doing.”
 
“be may,” said sancho, “‘pledges don’t distress good
 payer,’ ‘he god helps better gets early,’
 ‘it’s tripes carry feet feet tripes;’
 mean say god gives help duty honestly, no
 doubt i’ll govern better gerfalcon. nay, let put a
 finger mouth, they’ll see whether can bite not.”
 
“the curse god saints upon thee, thou accursed sancho!”
 exclaimed don quixote; “when will day come—as often said to
 thee—when shall hear thee make one single coherent, rational remark
 without proverbs? pray, highnesses, leave fool alone, he
 will grind souls between, say two, two thousand
 proverbs, dragged much season, much purpose
 as—may god grant much health him, want listen to
 them!”
 
“sancho panza’s proverbs,” said duchess, “though number
 greek commander’s, therefore less esteemed for
 conciseness maxims. part, can say give me
 pleasure others may better brought more
 seasonably introduced.”
 
pleasant conversation sort passed tent into
 wood, day spent visiting posts and
 hiding-places, night closed in, not, however, brilliantly
 tranquilly might expected season, was
 midsummer; bringing kind haze greatly aided
 project duke duchess; thus, night began fall,
 little twilight set in, suddenly whole wood four
 sides seemed fire, shortly after, here, there, all
 sides, vast number trumpets military instruments were
 heard, several troops cavalry passing wood.
 blaze fire noise warlike instruments almost
 blinded eyes deafened ears stood by, and
 indeed wood. heard repeated
 lelilies fashion moors rush battle;
 trumpets clarions brayed, drums beat, fifes played, unceasingly
 fast senses lose them
 confused din many instruments. duke astounded,
 duchess amazed, don quixote wondering, sancho panza trembling, and
 indeed, even aware cause frightened. their
 fear, silence fell upon them, postillion, guise a
 demon, passed front them, blowing, lieu bugle, huge
 hollow horn gave horrible hoarse note.
 
“ho there! brother courier,” cried duke, “who you? are
 going? troops seem passing the
 wood?”
 
courier replied harsh, discordant voice, “i the
 devil; search don quixote mancha; coming
 way six troops enchanters, bringing triumphal
 car peerless dulcinea toboso; comes enchantment,
 together gallant frenchman montesinos, give instructions to
 don quixote how, said lady, may disenchanted.”
 
“if devil, say appearance indicates,”
 said duke, “you known said knight don quixote la
 mancha, you.”
 
“by god upon conscience,” said devil, “i never observed it,
 mind occupied many different things was
 forgetting main thing came about.”
 
“this demon must honest fellow good christian,” said
 sancho; “for wasn’t wouldn’t swear god conscience;
 feel sure now must good souls even hell itself.”
 
without dismounting, demon turned don quixote said,
 “the unfortunate valiant knight montesinos sends thee, the
 knight lions (would saw thee claws), bidding me
 tell thee wait wherever may find thee, brings with
 call dulcinea toboso, may show thee what
 needful order disenchant her; came need
 stay longer; demons sort thee, good angels with
 gentles;” saying blew huge horn, turned and
 went without waiting reply anyone.
 
felt fresh wonder, particularly sancho don quixote;
 sancho see how, defiance truth, that
 dulcinea enchanted; don quixote feel sure
 whether happened cave montesinos true or
 not; deep cogitations duke said him, “do
 mean wait, señor don quixote?”
 
“why not?” replied he; “here will wait, fearless firm, though all
 hell come attack me.”
 
“well then, see another devil hear another horn like last,
 i’ll wait much flanders,” said sancho.
 
night now closed completely, many lights began flit
 wood, just fiery exhalations earth, that
 look like shooting-stars eyes, flit heavens; a
 frightful noise, too, heard, like made solid wheels the
 ox-carts usually have, harsh, ceaseless creaking which, they
 say, bears wolves put flight, happen any
 passing. addition commotion, came a
 disturbance increase tumult, now seemed in
 truth, four sides wood, four encounters battles were
 going time; one quarter resounded dull noise a
 terrible cannonade, another numberless muskets being
 discharged, shouts combatants sounded almost close hand,
 farther away moorish lelilies raised again. a

 cannon, musketry, tremendous noise carts,

 eyes see again. soon cart came opposite the
 spot old man rose lofty seat, standing said a
 loud voice, “i sage lirgandeo,” without another word the
 cart passed on. behind came another form, with
 another aged man enthroned, who, stopping cart, said voice no

 devilish, “i enchanter archelaus, mortal enemy amadis of

 distance three carts halted monotonous noise their
 wheels ceased, soon heard another, noise, sound

“nor lights bright,” said duchess; to
 sancho replied, “fire gives light, it’s bright there

“that remains seen,” said don quixote, listening all

don quixote hearing felt throat, turning duke he
 said, “by god, señor, dulcinea says true, soul stuck in
 throat like nut crossbow.”
 
“what say this, sancho?” said duchess.
 
“i say, señora,” returned sancho, “what said before; the
 lashes, abernuncio!”
 
“abrenuncio, say, sancho, do,” said duke.
 
“let alone, highness,” said sancho. “i’m humour now to
 look niceties letter less, lashes are
 given me, i’m give myself, upset me, don’t

“well then, fact is, friend sancho,” said duke, “that unless

 cruel governor flinty bowels, won’t yield tears of
 afflicted damsels prayers wise, magisterial, ancient

“señor,” said sancho, “won’t two days’ grace given to

“no, certainly not,” said merlin; “here, minute, spot,

“now then, sancho!” said duchess, “show courage, gratitude for

sancho replied irrelevant remark, which, addressing
 merlin, made him, “will worship tell me, señor merlin—when
 courier devil came gave master message señor
 montesinos, charging wait here, coming to
 arrange lady doña dulcinea toboso disenchanted;
 present seen montesinos, anything like

merlin made answer, “the devil, sancho, blockhead a

“there great many doctors world; even enchanters are

“hush, friend sancho,” said don quixote; “since lady duenna comes

 serve duennas service queens empresses, in

doña rodriguez, present, made answer, “my lady the

“for that,” said sancho, “there’s much clipped about
 duennas, barber said, ‘it will better stir the
 rice even though sticks.’”
 
“these squires,” returned doña rodriguez, “are always enemies; and
 haunting spirits antechambers watch us at

twelve duennas lady came procession pace, faces

 band duennas fully sight, duke, duchess, and
 don quixote stood up, well watching slow-moving
 procession. twelve duennas halted formed lane, along which
 distressed one advanced, trifaldin still holding hand. on
 seeing duke, duchess, don quixote went twelve
 paces forward meet her. then, kneeling ground, said a
 voice hoarse rough, rather fine delicate, “may please
 highnesses offer courtesies servant, i
 say handmaid, distress i

 unparalleled misfortune carried wits, know not

 less find them.”
 
“he wanting wits, señora countess,” said duke, “who did
 perceive worth person, glance may seen
 deserves cream courtesy flower polite usage;” and
 raising hand led seat beside duchess, who
 likewise received great urbanity. don quixote remained silent,
 sancho dying see features trifaldi one two
 many duennas; possibility they
 displayed accord free will.
 
kept still, waiting see break silence, the
 distressed duenna words: “i confident, mighty

“the panza here,” said sancho, anyone reply, “and don
 quixotissimus too; so, distressedest duenissima, may say
 willissimus, readissimus any

don quixote rose, addressing distressed duenna, said,
 “if sorrows, afflicted lady, can indulge hope relief

 feeble limited though be, shall entirely devoted your
 service. don quixote mancha, whose calling give aid
 needy sorts; so, necessary for

 tell woes plainly straightforwardly: have

hearing this, distressed duenna made though throw
 don quixote’s feet, actually fall and
 said, strove embrace them, “before feet legs cast

 turning don quixote sancho panza, grasping hands, she
 said, “o thou, loyal squire ever served knight-errant this

 thyself that, serving great don quixote, thou art serving,
 summed one, whole host knights ever borne arms
 world. conjure thee, thou owest thy loyal
 goodness, thou wilt become kind intercessor thy master,
 speedily give aid humble unfortunate

sancho made answer, “as goodness, señora, long

 life, that’s point; beards care little or
 nothing; without blandishments prayers, will beg my
 master (for know loves me, and, besides, need just

“i will pluck land moors,” said don quixote,
 “if don’t cure yours.”
 
instant trifaldi recovered swoon said, “the

 swoon, means reviving bringing back my
 senses; implore you, illustrious errant, indomitable
 sir, let gracious promises turned deeds.”
 
“there shall delay part,” said don quixote. “bethink you,

“the fact is,” replied distressed one, “it five thousand

“for going smoothly easily,” said sancho this, “give my

laughed, distressed one continued: “and same

“and many room horse?” asked sancho.
 
“two,” said distressed one, “one saddle, on
 croup; generally two knight squire, is
 damsel that’s carried off.”
 
“i’d like know, señora distressed one,” said sancho, “what the

“his name,” said distressed one, “is bellerophon’s

 bucephalus, orlando furioso’s, name brigliador, nor

“i’ll bet,” said sancho, “that given none these
 famous names well-known horses, given name

“that true,” said bearded countess, “still fits very
 well, called clavileño swift, name accordance
 made wood, peg forehead, and
 swift pace travels; so, far name goes,

“i nothing say name,” said sancho; “but what

“i said already,” said trifaldi, “that peg, by
 turning one side knight rides makes

“i’d like see him,” said sancho; “but fancy i’m going mount

“yes, can, friend,” replied trifaldi; “and much, that
 without you, understand, shall able nothing.”
 
“in king’s name!” exclaimed sancho, “what squires got do
 adventures masters? fame such

 say, ‘such knight finished an
 adventure, help so, squire, without it
 impossible accomplish it;’ write
 curtly, “don paralipomenon three stars accomplished the
 adventure six monsters;’ without mentioning person his
 squire, time, just being.
 more, sirs, say master may go alone, much good may do
 him; i’ll stay company lady duchess; and
 maybe comes back, will find lady dulcinea’s affair ever
 much advanced; mean leisure hours, idle moments, to

“for must go necessary, good sancho,” said the
 duchess, “for worthy folk ask you; faces these
 ladies must remain overgrown way idle

“in king’s name, more!” said sancho; “if charitable work
 done sake damsels confinement or
 charity-girls, man might expose hardships; to
 bear sake stripping beards duennas! devil take it!
 i’d sooner see bearded, highest lowest, and

“you hard duennas, sancho friend,” said duchess;
 “you incline much opinion toledo apothecary. but
 indeed wrong; duennas house may serve as
 patterns duennas; doña rodriguez, will allow
 say otherwise.”
 
“your excellence may say like,” said rodriguez; “for god
 knows truth everything; whether duennas good bad,
 bearded smooth, mothers’ daughters like women; and
 god sent us world, knows did, mercy i
 rely, anybody’s beard.”
 
“well, señora rodriguez, señora trifaldi, present company,” said
 don quixote, “i trust heaven will look kindly eyes upon

 let find face face malambruno, certain
 razor will shave easily sword shall shave
 malambruno’s head shoulders; ‘god bears wicked,

“ah!” exclaimed distressed one this, “may stars the

now night came, appointed time arrival of
 famous horse clavileño, non-appearance already
 beginning make don quixote uneasy, struck that, as
 malambruno long sending it, either the
 knight adventure reserved, else malambruno not
 dare meet single combat. lo! suddenly came the
 garden four wild-men clad green ivy bearing shoulders a
 great wooden horse. placed feet ground, one
 wild-men said, “let knight heart mount this
 machine.”
 
sancho exclaimed, “i don’t mount, neither heart nor
 knight.”
 
“and let squire, one,” continued wild-man, “take his
 seat croup, let trust valiant malambruno; no
 sword save his, malice other, shall assailed.
 turn peg horse neck, will bear
 air malambruno awaits them; lest vast
 elevation course make giddy, eyes must be
 covered horse neighs, will sign having
 completed journey.”
 
words, leaving clavileño behind them, retired easy
 dignity way came. soon distressed one saw horse,
 almost tears exclaimed don quixote, “valiant knight, the
 promise malambruno proved trustworthy; horse come, our
 beards growing, every hair us implore thee to
 shave shear us, mounting thy squire and
 making happy beginning new journey.”
 
“that will, señora countess trifaldi,” said don quixote, “most gladly
 right goodwill, without stopping take cushion put on
 spurs, lose time, desire see all
 duennas shaved clean.”
 
“that won’t,” said sancho, “with good-will bad-will, way at
 all; shaving can’t done without mounting the
 croup, master better look another squire go him,
 ladies way making faces smooth; i’m
 witch taste travelling air. my
 islanders say heard governor going, strolling about
 winds? another thing, three thousand odd
 leagues kandy, horse tires, giant takes
 huff, we’ll half dozen years getting back, won’t isle
 island world will know me: so, common
 saying ‘in delay there’s danger,’ ‘when offer thee heifer
 run halter,’ ladies’ beards must excuse me; ‘saint peter
 well rome;’ mean well house so
 much made me, hope good thing master as
 see governor.”
 
“friend sancho,” said duke this, “the island have
 promised moving one, one will run away; has
 roots deeply buried bowels earth will no
 easy matter pluck shift is; know as
 well sort office importance is
 obtained bribe kind, great small; well then, that
 look receive government go your
 master don quixote, bring memorable adventure conclusion;
 whether return clavileño quickly speed seems to
 promise, adverse fortune brings back foot travelling a
 pilgrim hostel hostel inn inn, will always find
 island return left it, islanders with
 eagerness always receive their
 governor, good-will will remain same; doubt truth of
 this, señor sancho, grievously wronging my
 disposition serve you.”
 
“say more, señor,” said sancho; “i poor squire equal to
 carrying much courtesy; let master mount; bandage eyes and
 commit god’s care, tell may commend our
 lord call upon angels protect go towering up
 there.”
 
trifaldi made answer, “sancho, may freely commend
 god will; malambruno though enchanter is
 christian, works enchantments great circumspection,
 taking good care fall anyone.”
 
“well then,” said sancho, “god holy trinity gaeta give
 help!”
 
“since memorable adventure fulling mills,” said don quixote,
 “i never seen sancho fright now; as
 superstitious others abject fear cause little
 trepidation spirit. come here, sancho, leave of
 gentles say word two thee private;” and
 drawing sancho aside among trees garden seizing his
 hands said, “thou seest, brother sancho, long journey have
 us, god knows shall return, leisure or
 opportunities business will allow us; wish thee therefore to
 retire now thy chamber, though thou wert going fetch something
 required road, trice give thyself five
 hundred lashes account three thousand three hundred which
 thou art bound; will good, make beginning
 thing half finished.”
 
“by god,” said sancho, “but worship must senses!
 like common saying, ‘you see child, want me
 virgin.’ just i’m go sitting bare board, your
 worship score backside! indeed, worship not
 reasonable. let us shave duennas; return i
 promise word make haste wipe that’s due as
 will satisfy worship; can’t say more.”
 
“well, will comfort promise, good sancho,”
 replied don quixote, “and believe thou wilt keep it; indeed
 though stupid thou art veracious.”
 
“i’m voracious,” said sancho, “only peckish; even a
 little, still i’d keep word.”
 
went back mount clavileño, to
 don quixote said, “cover thine eyes, sancho, mount; one
 sends us lands far distant mean deceive us
 sake paltry glory derived deceiving persons
 trust him; though turn contrary i
 hope, malice will able dim glory undertaken this
 exploit.”
 
“let us off, señor,” said sancho, “for taken beards and
 tears ladies deeply heart, shan’t eat bit relish
 seen restored former smoothness. mount,
 worship, blindfold yourself, go croup,
 plain rider saddle must mount first.”
 
“that true,” said don quixote, and, taking handkerchief his
 pocket, begged distressed one bandage eyes very
 carefully; bandaged uncovered again,
 saying, “if memory deceive me, read virgil the
 palladium troy, wooden horse greeks offered goddess
 pallas, big armed knights, afterwards the
 destruction troy; well see, first all, what
 clavileño stomach.”
 
“there occasion,” said distressed one; “i will bail for
 him, know malambruno nothing tricky treacherous about
 him; may mount without fear, señor don quixote; head be
 harm befalls you.”
 
don quixote thought say anything regard his
 safety putting courage unfavourable light; so,
 without words, mounted clavileño, tried peg, which
 turned easily; stirrups legs hung down, he
 looked like nothing much figure roman triumph painted
 embroidered flemish tapestry.
 
much grain, slowly, sancho proceeded mount,
 and, settling well croup, found it
 rather hard, soft, asked duke be
 possible oblige pad kind, cushion; even if
 couch lady duchess, bed one the
 pages; haunches horse like marble wood.
 trifaldi observed clavileño bear kind of
 harness trappings, best plan sit sideways
 like woman, way feel hardness much.
 
sancho so, and, bidding farewell, allowed eyes be
 bandaged, immediately afterwards uncovered again, looking
 tenderly tearfully garden, bade help in
 present strait plenty paternosters ave marias, god
 might provide someone say many them, whenever found
 similar emergency.
 
don quixote exclaimed, “art thou gallows, thief, at
 thy last moment, use pitiful entreaties sort? cowardly,
 spiritless creature, art thou place fair magalona
 occupied, descended, grave, to
 become queen france; unless histories lie? here
 beside thee, may put par valiant pierres,
 pressed spot now press? cover thine eyes, cover
 thine eyes, abject animal, let thy fear escape thy lips, at
 least presence.”
 
“blindfold me,” said sancho; “as won’t let commend be
 commended god, wonder afraid region of
 devils will carry us peralvillo?”
 
blindfolded, don quixote, finding settled to
 satisfaction, felt peg, instant placed his
 fingers it, duennas stood lifted their
 voices exclaiming, “god guide thee, valiant knight! god thee,
 intrepid squire! now, now ye go cleaving air swiftly an
 arrow! now ye begin amaze astonish gazing you
 earth! take care wobble about, valiant sancho! mind
 thou fall not, thy fall will worse rash youth’s who
 tried steer chariot father sun!”
 
sancho heard voices, clinging tightly master winding
 arms round him, said, “señor, make going
 high, voices reach us seem speaking
 quite close us?”
 
“don’t mind that, sancho,” said don quixote; “for affairs this
 sort, flights like common course things, you
 can see hear much like thousand leagues off; don’t
 squeeze tight thou wilt upset me; really know what
 thou hast uneasy frightened at, can safely swear never
 mounted smoother-going steed days life; one fancy
 never stirred one place. banish fear, friend, indeed
 everything going ought, wind astern.”
 
“that’s true,” said sancho, “for strong wind comes on
 side, seems people blowing a
 thousand pair bellows;” case; puffing him
 great pair bellows; whole adventure well
 planned duke, duchess, majordomo, nothing was
 omitted make perfectly successful.
 
don quixote now, feeling blast, said, “beyond doubt, sancho, we
 must already reached second region air, hail
 snow generated; thunder, lightning, the
 thunderbolts engendered third region, go on
 ascending rate, shall shortly plunge region of
 fire, know regulate peg, mount up
 shall burned.”
 
now began warm faces, distance, tow that
 easily set fire extinguished again, fixed end of
 cane. feeling heat sancho said, “may die not
 already fire place, near it, good part my
 beard singed, mind, señor, uncover see
 whereabouts are.”
 
“do nothing kind,” said don quixote; “remember true story of
 licentiate torralva devils carried flying air
 riding stick eyes shut; twelve hours reached rome
 dismounted torre di nona, street city, saw
 whole sack storming death bourbon, back in
 madrid next morning, gave account seen;
 said moreover going air, devil
 bade open eyes, so, saw near body
 moon, seemed him, laid hold it
 hand, dare look earth lest he
 seized giddiness. that, sancho, will us
 uncover ourselves, us charge will responsible
 us; perhaps gaining altitude mounting to
 enable us descend one swoop kingdom kandy, saker
 falcon heron, seize however high may
 soar; though seems us half hour since left the
 garden, believe must travelled great distance.”
 
“i don’t know may be,” said sancho; “all know the
 señora magallanes magalona satisfied croup, could
 tender flesh.”
 
duke, duchess, garden listening the
 conversation two heroes, beyond measure amused it;
 now, desirous putting finishing touch rare and
 well-contrived adventure, applied light clavileño’s tail with
 tow, horse, full squibs crackers, immediately
 blew prodigious noise, brought don quixote sancho
 panza ground half singed. time bearded band of
 duennas, trifaldi all, vanished garden, those
 remained lay stretched ground swoon. don quixote
 sancho got rather shaken, and, looking them, filled
 amazement finding garden they
 started, seeing number people stretched the
 ground; astonishment increased one side the
 garden perceived tall lance planted ground, hanging
 two cords green silk smooth white parchment which
 following inscription large gold letters: “the
 illustrious knight don quixote mancha has, merely attempting
 it, finished concluded adventure countess trifaldi,
 otherwise called distressed duenna; malambruno now satisfied on
 every point, chins duennas now smooth clean, and
 king don clavijo queen antonomasia original form; when
 squirely flagellation shall completed, white dove
 shall find delivered pestiferous gerfalcons that
 persecute her, arms beloved mate; the
 decree sage merlin, arch-enchanter enchanters.”
 
soon don quixote read inscription parchment he
 perceived clearly referred disenchantment dulcinea,
 returning hearty thanks heaven little danger
 achieved grand exploit restore former complexion
 countenances venerable duennas, advanced towards the
 duke duchess, yet come themselves, taking the
 duke hand said, “be good cheer, worthy sir, good
 cheer; it’s nothing all; adventure now without any
 harm done, inscription fixed post shows plainly.”
 
duke came slowly like one recovering consciousness
 heavy sleep, duchess fallen prostrate
 garden same, demonstrations wonder and
 amazement almost persuaded one they
 pretended adroitly jest happened reality. duke
 read placard half-shut eyes, ran embrace don
 quixote open arms, declaring best knight had
 ever seen age. sancho kept looking distressed
 one, see face like without beard, as
 fair elegant person promised; told that, the
 instant clavileño descended flaming air came the
 ground, whole band duennas trifaldi vanished, that
 already shaved without stump left.
 
duchess asked sancho fared long journey, to
 sancho replied, “i felt, señora, flying the
 region fire, master told me, wanted uncover eyes
 bit; master, asked leave uncover myself, would
 let me; little bit curiosity me, a
 desire know forbidden kept me, quietly without
 anyone seeing drew aside handkerchief covering eyes ever so
 little, close nose, underneath looked towards earth,

 mustard seed, men walking little bigger than
 hazel nuts; may see high must got then.”
 
duchess said, “sancho, friend, mind saying;
 seems seen earth, men walking on
 it; earth looked like grain mustard seed, and
 man like hazel nut, one man alone covered whole
 earth.”
 
“that true,” said sancho, “but got glimpse bit
 one side it, saw all.”
 
“take care, sancho,” said duchess, “with bit one side one does
 see whole one looks at.”
 
“i don’t understand way looking things,” said sancho; “i
 know ladyship will well bear mind we

“and good sancho amusing goats,” said
 duke, “how señor don quixote amuse himself?”
 
don quixote replied, “as things like

“i neither lying dreaming,” said sancho; “only ask tokens

“tell us then, sancho,” said duchess.
 
“two them,” said sancho, “are green, two blood-red, two blue, and
 one mixture colours.”
 
“an odd sort goat, that,” said duke; “in earthly region of

“that’s plain,” said sancho; “of course must difference

“tell me, sancho,” said duke, “did see he-goat among those

“no, señor,” said sancho; “but heard say none ever passed

sancho made obeisance, said, “ever since came from

“recollect, sancho,” said duke, “i give bit heaven, no

 uncommonly fertile fruitful, where, know use your

“well then,” said sancho, “let island come; i’ll try be

“if make trial it, sancho,” said duke, “you’ll eat your

“go ungirt loose, sancho; disordered attire sign an
 unstable mind, unless indeed slovenliness slackness be

 cæsar.
 
“ascertain cautiously thy office may worth; will
 allow thee give liveries thy servants, give respectable and
 serviceable, rather showy gay ones, divide between
 thy servants poor; say, thou canst clothe six
 pages, clothe three three poor men, thus thou wilt pages
 heaven pages earth; vainglorious never think this
 new mode giving liveries.
 
“eat garlic onions, lest find thy boorish origin by

 make seem thou art listening thyself, affectation is
 bad.
 
“dine sparingly sup sparingly still; health the
 whole body forged workshop stomach.
 
“be temperate drinking, bearing mind wine excess keeps
 neither secrets promises.
 
“take care, sancho, chew sides, eruct in
 anybody’s presence.”
 
“eruct!” said sancho; “i don’t know means.”
 
“to eruct, sancho,” said don quixote, “means belch, one
 filthiest words spanish language, though very
 expressive one; therefore nice folk recourse latin,
 instead belch say eruct, instead belches say eructations;
 understand terms matters little, custom
 will bring use course time, will be
 readily understood; way language enriched; custom and
 public all-powerful there.”
 
“in truth, señor,” said sancho, “one counsels cautions i
 mean bear mind shall this, belch, i’m constantly
 it.”
 
“eruct, sancho, belch,” said don quixote.
 
“eruct, shall say henceforth, swear forget it,” said
 sancho.
 
“likewise, sancho,” said don quixote, “thou must mingle a
 quantity proverbs thy discourse thou dost; though proverbs
 short maxims, thou dost drag often head and
 shoulders savour nonsense maxims.”
 
“god alone can cure that,” said sancho; “for proverbs me

 tongue lets fly first come, though may pat the
 purpose. i’ll take care henceforward use befit the
 dignity office; ‘in house there’s plenty, supper is
 soon cooked,’ ‘he binds wrangle,’ ‘the
 bell-ringer’s safe berth,’ ‘giving keeping require
 brains.’”
 
“that’s it, sancho!” said don quixote; “pack, tack, string proverbs
 together; nobody hindering thee! ‘my mother beats me, go on
 tricks.’ bidding thee avoid proverbs, second
 thou hast shot whole litany them, much do
 talking ‘over hills Úbeda.’ mind,
 sancho, say proverb aptly brought objectionable;
 pile string together proverbs random makes

“when thou ridest horseback, go lolling thy body the

“be moderate thy sleep; rise early get

“the last counsel will give thee now, though tend to

“thy attire shall hose full length, long jerkin, cloak a
 trifle longer; loose breeches means, becoming
 neither gentlemen governors.
 
“for present, sancho, occurred advise
 thee; time goes occasions arise instructions shall follow,

“señor,” said sancho, “i see well enough things your
 worship said good, holy, profitable; use

 letting nails grow, marrying the
 chance, will slip head; hash, muddle,
 jumble—i don’t can’t recollect last

“ah, sinner am!” said don quixote, “how bad looks in
 governors know read write; let tell thee,
 sancho, man knows read, left-handed, argues
 one two things; either exceedingly mean and
 lowly parents, incorrigible and
 ill-conditioned neither good company good teaching make
 impression him. great defect thou labourest under,
 therefore thee learn rate sign thy name.”
 
“i can sign name well enough,” said sancho, “for steward

 like marks bales goods, told made name.
 besides can pretend right hand disabled make someone else

 time generous, mean be, fault will seen me.
 ‘only make honey flies will suck you;’ ‘as much as
 thou hast much art thou worth,’ grandmother used say; and
 ‘thou canst revenge man substance.’”
 
“oh, god’s curse upon thee, sancho!” exclaimed don quixote; “sixty
 thousand devils fly away thee thy proverbs! last hour
 thou hast stringing together inflicting pangs of
 torture every one them. proverbs will bring thee to
 gallows one day, promise thee; thy subjects will take the
 government thee, will revolts among them. tell me,
 dost thou pick up, thou booby? dost thou apply them,
 thou blockhead? me, utter one make apply properly, i
 sweat labour digging.”
 
“by god, master mine,” said sancho, “your worship making fuss
 little. devil vexed make use of
 own? got nothing else, stock in
 trade except proverbs proverbs; three just this
 instant come head, pat purpose like pears a
 basket; won’t repeat them, ‘sage silence called sancho.’”
 
“that, sancho, thou art not,” said don quixote; “for art thou
 sage silence, thou art pestilent prate perversity; still i
 like know three proverbs just now come thy
 memory, turning mine own—and good one—and
 none occurs me.”
 
“what can better,” said sancho, “than ‘never put thy thumbs between
 two back teeth;’ ‘to “_get house_” “_what want
 wife?_” answer;’ ‘whether pitcher hits the
 stone, stone pitcher, it’s bad business pitcher;’
 fit hair? one quarrel governor,
 authority him, will come worst, he
 puts finger two back back
 teeth makes difference, long teeth; to
 whatever governor may say there’s answer, ‘get
 house’ ‘what want wife?’ then, for
 stone pitcher, blind man see that. so
 ‘who sees mote another’s eye need see beam in
 own,’ said himself, ‘the dead woman was
 frightened one throat cut;’ worship knows well
 ‘the fool knows house wise man in
 another’s.’”
 
“nay, sancho,” said don quixote, “the fool knows nothing, either his
 house anybody else’s, wise structure sort can
 stand foundation folly; let us say it,
 sancho, thou governest badly, thine will fault mine
 shame; comfort done duty advising
 thee earnestly wisely could; thus released from
 obligations promise. god guide thee, sancho, govern thee
 thy government, deliver misgiving thou
 wilt turn whole island upside down, thing might easily prevent
 explaining duke thou art telling that
 fat little person thine nothing else sack full proverbs
 sauciness.”
 
“señor,” said sancho, “if worship thinks i’m fit this
 government, give spot; mere black nail of
 soul dearer whole body; can live just as
 well, simple sancho, bread onions, governor, partridges
 capons; what’s more, we’re asleep we’re equal, great
 small, rich poor. worship looks it, will
 see worship alone put business of
 governing; know government islands a
 buzzard; there’s reason think a
 governor devil will get hold me, i’d rather go sancho heaven
 governor hell.”
 
“by god, sancho,” said don quixote, “for last words thou hast
 uttered alone, consider thou deservest governor thousand
 islands. thou hast good natural instincts, without knowledge
 worth anything; commend thyself god, try swerve the
 pursuit thy main object; mean, always make thy aim fixed
 purpose right matters come thee, heaven
 always helps good intentions; now let us go dinner, think
 lord lady waiting us.”

recorded, then, soon sancho gone, don quixote felt
 loneliness, possible revoke mandate
 take away government done so. the
 duchess observed dejection asked melancholy;
 because, said, loss sancho, were
 squires, duennas, damsels house wait upon to

“the truth is, señora,” replied don quixote, “that feel loss
 sancho; main cause looking sad; all
 offers excellence makes me, accept good-will with

“indeed, señor don quixote,” said duchess, “that must be; four
 damsels, beautiful flowers, shall wait upon you.”
 
“to me,” said don quixote, “they will flowers, thorns to
 pierce heart. they, anything like them, shall soon enter my
 chamber fly. highness wishes gratify still further,
 though deserve not, permit please myself, wait upon

 generosity highness disposed display towards me; and, in
 short, will sleep clothes, sooner allow anyone undress

“say more, señor don quixote, say more,” said duchess; “i

don quixote replied, “your highness spoken like you

 will fortunate, better known world praise of
 highness eulogies greatest orators earth
 bestow upon her.”
 
“well, well, señor don quixote,” said duchess, nearly
 supper-time, duke probably waiting; come let us go to
 supper, retire rest early, journey made yesterday

“i feel none, señora,” said don quixote, “for go far to

“probably,” said duchess, “repenting evil done the

don quixote renewed thanks duchess; supped,

come point, then—sancho attendants arrived a
 village thousand inhabitants, one largest duke
 possessed. informed called island of
 barataria, either name village baratario, or
 joke way government conferred
 upon him. reaching gates town, walled one,
 municipality came forth meet him, bells rang peal, and
 inhabitants showed every sign general satisfaction; with
 great pomp conducted principal church give thanks to
 god, burlesque ceremonies presented the
 keys town, acknowledged perpetual governor the
 island barataria. costume, beard, fat squat figure
 new governor astonished secret,
 even were, few. finally, leading him
 church carried judgment seat seated him

 island, señor governor, comes take possession of
 famous island bound answer question shall put to
 him, must somewhat knotty difficult one; his
 answer people take measure new governor’s wit, and
 hail joy deplore arrival accordingly.”
 
majordomo making speech sancho gazing several
 large letters inscribed wall opposite seat, could
 read asked painted wall. the
 answer was, “señor, written recorded day your
 lordship took possession island, inscription says,
 ‘this day, so-and-so such-and-such month year, señor don
 sancho panza took possession island; many years may enjoy
 it.’”
 
“and call don sancho panza?” asked sancho.
 
“your lordship,” replied majordomo; “for panza one
 now seated chair ever entered island.”
 
“well then, let tell you, brother,” said sancho, “i haven’t got the
 ‘don,’ anyone family ever it; name plain sancho
 panza, sancho father’s name, sancho grandfather’s
 panzas, without dons doñas tacked on; i
 suspect island dons stones; never
 mind; god knows mean, maybe government lasts four days
 i’ll weed dons doubt great nuisance the
 midges, they’re plenty. let majordomo go question,
 i’ll give best answer can, whether people deplore or
 not.”
 
instant came court two old men, one carrying cane
 way walking-stick, one stick said, “señor,

 whenever ask them. long time passed asked
 them, put greater straits return them

 careless payment asked several times; not
 will give back, denies owes them, and
 says never lent crowns; did, repaid

 never paid me; want worship put oath, he
 swears returned forgive debt before

“what say this, good old man, stick?” said sancho.
 
old man replied, “i admit, señor, lent me;
 let worship lower staff, leaves oath,
 i’ll swear gave back, paid really truly.”
 
governor lowered staff, old man had
 stick handed old man hold he
 swore, found way; laid hand the
 cross staff, saying true ten crowns were
 demanded lent him; hand
 given back hand other, he, not
 recollecting it, always asking them.
 
seeing great governor asked creditor answer to
 make opponent said. said doubt debtor had
 told truth, believed honest man good
 christian, must forgotten given
 back crowns; time forth make no
 demand upon him.
 
debtor took stick again, bowing head left court.
 observing this, how, without another word, made off, and
 observing resignation plaintiff, sancho buried head
 bosom remained short space deep thought, the
 forefinger right hand brow nose; raised his
 head bade call back old man stick, had
 already taken departure. brought back, soon as
 sancho saw said, “honest man, give stick, want
 it.”
 
“willingly,” said old man; “here señor,” put into
 hand.
 
sancho took and, handing old man, said him, “go,
 god you; now paid.”
 
“i, señor!” returned old man; “why, cane worth ten
 gold-crowns?”
 
“yes,” said governor, “or greatest dolt the
 world; now will see whether got headpiece govern a
 whole kingdom;” ordered cane broken two, there, in
 presence all. done, middle found
 ten gold-crowns. filled amazement, looked upon their
 governor another solomon. asked come the
 conclusion ten crowns cane; replied, that
 observing old man swore gave stick opponent
 taking oath, swore really truly
 given crowns, soon done swearing asked
 stick again, came head sum demanded must
 inside it; said might seen god sometimes
 guides govern judgments, even though may be
 fools; besides heard curate village mention
 just another case, good memory, not
 forgot everything wished remember, be

 crestfallen, high contentment, present
 astonished, recording words, deeds, and
 movements sancho make mind whether look
 upon set fool man sense.
 
soon case disposed of, came court woman
 holding tight grip man dressed like well-to-do cattle
 dealer, came forward making great outcry exclaiming,
 “justice, señor governor, justice! don’t get earth i’ll

 brambles, good fellow come now clean hands handle
 me!”
 
“it remains proved whether gallant clean hands not,”
 said sancho; turning man asked say in
 answer woman’s charge.
 
confusion made answer, “sirs, poor pig dealer, and
 morning left village sell (saving presence) four
 pigs, dues cribbings got little less
 worth them. returning village fell on

 governor bade take hand complainant; obeyed
 trembling; woman took it, making thousand salaams and
 praying god long life health señor governor who

soon gone sancho said cattle dealer, whose tears
 already starting whose eyes heart following his
 purse, “good fellow, go woman take purse her,
 force even, come back here;” say to
 one fool deaf, man like flash of
 lightning, ran bid.
 
bystanders waited anxiously see end case, and
 presently man woman came back even closer grips than
 before, petticoat purse lap it, and
 struggling hard take her, purpose, stout
 woman’s defence, crying out, “justice from
 god world! see here, señor governor, shamelessness and
 boldness villain, middle town, middle
 street, wanted take purse worship bade him
 give me.”
 
“and take it?” asked governor.
 
“take it!” said woman; “i’d let life taken sooner
 purse. pretty child i’d be! it’s another sort cat they
 must throw face, poor scurvy knave. pincers and
 hammers, mallets chisels get grip; no, nor
 lions’ claws; soul body first!”
 
“she right,” said man; “i beaten powerless; i
 confess haven’t strength take her;” let go his

upon governor said woman, “let see purse, my
 worthy sturdy friend.” handed once, the
 governor returned man, said unforced mistress of
 force, “sister, shown much, half much, spirit

woman cowed went disconsolately, hanging head; and
 governor said man, “honest man, go home money, and
 god speed you; future, don’t want lose it, see
 don’t take head yoke anybody.” man
 thanked clumsily went way, the
 bystanders filled admiration new governor’s

next, two men, one apparently farm labourer, tailor,
 pair shears hand, presented before
 him, tailor said, “señor governor, labourer come

 following ballad, day composed:
 
mighty love hearts maidens

sewing, stitching, labour,

 poison love instilleth

proper-minded maidens

men prudence discretion,

 wanton damsels dally,
 modest take wife.

history says justice court carried sancho a
 sumptuous palace, spacious chamber table laid
 royal magnificence. clarions sounded sancho entered the
 room, four pages came forward present water his
 hands, sancho received great dignity. music ceased, and
 sancho seated head table, that
 seat placed, one cover laid. personage, it
 appeared afterwards physician, placed standing his
 side whalebone wand hand. lifted fine
 white cloth covering fruit great variety dishes different
 sorts; one looked like student said grace, page put laced
 bib sancho, another played part head carver placed
 dish fruit him. hardly tasted morsel the
 man wand touched plate it, took away from
 utmost celerity. carver, however, brought him
 another dish, sancho proceeded try it; get
 it, say taste it, already wand touched page
 carried promptitude fruit. sancho
 seeing puzzled, looking one another asked this
 dinner eaten fashion jugglery trick.
 
wand replied, “it eaten, señor
 governor, except usual customary islands there
 governors. i, señor, physician, paid salary this
 island serve governors such, much greater regard
 health own, studying day night making
 acquainted governor’s constitution, order able
 cure falls sick. chief thing to
 attend dinners suppers allow eat appears to
 fit him, keep think will harm
 injurious stomach; therefore ordered plate of
 fruit removed moist, dish ordered
 removed hot containing many spices that
 stimulate thirst; drinks much kills consumes radical
 moisture wherein life consists.”
 
“well then,” said sancho, “that dish roast partridges that
 seems savoury will harm.”
 
physician replied, “of lord governor shall not
 eat long live.”
 
“why so?” said sancho.
 
“because,” replied doctor, “our master hippocrates, polestar
 beacon medicine, says one aphorisms _omnis saturatio
 mala, perdicis autem pessima_, means ‘all repletion bad, but
 partridge worst all.”
 
“in case,” said sancho, “let señor doctor see among dishes
 table will good least harm, let
 eat it, without tapping stick; life the
 governor, may god suffer enjoy it, i’m dying of
 hunger; spite doctor may say, deny food
 way take life instead prolonging it.”
 
“your worship right, señor governor,” said physician; “and
 therefore worship, consider, eat stewed
 rabbits there, furry kind food; veal were
 roasted served pickles, might try it; of
 question.”
 
“that big dish smoking farther off,” said sancho, “seems me
 olla podrida, diversity things such
 ollas, can’t fail light upon something tasty good me.”

“_absit_,” said doctor; “far us base thought!
 nothing world less nourishing olla podrida; to
 canons, rectors colleges, peasants’ weddings ollas
 podridas, let us none tables governors,
 everything present delicate refined; and
 reason is, always, everywhere everybody, simple
 medicines esteemed compound ones, go wrong
 simple, compound may, merely
 altering quantity things composing them. of
 opinion governor eat now order preserve fortify
 health hundred wafer cakes thin slices of
 conserve quinces, will settle stomach help his
 digestion.”
 
sancho hearing threw back chair surveyed the
 doctor steadily, solemn tone asked name and
 studied.
 
replied, “my name, señor governor, doctor pedro recio aguero i
 native place called tirteafuera lies caracuel
 almodóvar campo, right-hand side, degree
 doctor university osuna.”
 
sancho, glowing rage, returned, “then let doctor
 pedro recio malaguero, native tirteafuera, place that’s the
 right-hand side go caracuel almodóvar campo, graduate
 osuna, get presence once; swear sun i’ll
 take cudgel, dint blows, beginning him, i’ll leave
 doctor whole island; least know ignorant;
 learned, wise, sensible physicians, will reverence and
 honour divine persons. say let pedro recio get of
 i’ll take chair sitting break his
 head. call account it, i’ll clear by
 saying served god killing bad doctor—a general executioner. and
 now give something eat, else take government; trade
 feed master worth two beans.”
 
doctor dismayed saw governor passion, and
 made tirteafuera room same
 instant post-horn sounded street; carver putting his
 head window turned round said, “it’s courier my
 lord duke, doubt despatch importance.”
 
courier came sweating flurried, taking paper from
 bosom, placed governor’s hands. sancho handed the
 majordomo bade read superscription, ran thus:
 
_to don sancho panza, governor island barataria, own
 hands secretary._
 
sancho heard said, “which secretary?” “i am,
 señor,” said one present, “for can read write, a
 biscayan.” “with addition,” said sancho, “you might secretary
 emperor himself; open paper see says.” the
 new-born secretary obeyed, read contents said matter
 one discussed private. sancho ordered chamber be
 cleared, majordomo carver remaining; doctor and
 others withdrew, secretary read letter, was
 follows:
 
come knowledge, señor don sancho panza, certain
 enemies mine island make furious attack

 keep watch, surprise not. also know trustworthy
 spies four persons entered town disguise order to

 august, four morning.
 

friend,
 duke
 

sancho astonished, stood made believe so
 too, turning majordomo said him, “what got to
 first, must done once, put doctor recio the
 lock-up; anyone wants kill he, slow death
 worst all, hunger.”
 
“likewise,” said carver, “it opinion worship not
 eat anything table, whole present from
 nuns; say, ‘behind cross there’s devil.’”
 
“i don’t deny it,” said sancho; “so present give piece of
 bread four pounds grapes; poison can come them; for
 fact can’t go without eating; prepared
 battles threatening us must well provisioned;
 tripes carry heart heart tripes.
 you, secretary, answer lord duke tell his
 commands shall obeyed letter, directs; say me
 lady duchess kiss hands, beg not
 forget send letter bundle wife teresa panza a
 messenger; will take great favour will fail to

 may enclose kiss hand master don quixote may
 see grateful bread; good secretary good biscayan
 may add whatever like whatever will come best; now
 take away cloth give something eat, i’ll ready to
 meet spies assassins enchanters may come against
 island.”
 
instant page entered saying, “here farmer business,
 wants speak lordship matter great importance, he
 says.”
 
“it’s odd,” said sancho, “the ways men business; it
 possible can fools see hour like is
 hour coming business? govern judges—are
 men flesh blood, allowed time
 required taking rest, unless they’d us made marble? god
 conscience, government remains hands (which i
 notion won’t), i’ll bring one man business to
 order. however, tell good man come in; take care first of
 spy one assassins.”
 
“no, lord,” said page, “for looks like simple fellow, and
 either know little good good bread.”
 
“there nothing afraid of,” said majordomo, “for all
 here.”
 
“would possible, carver,” said sancho, “now doctor pedro
 recio here, let eat something solid substantial, it
 even piece bread onion?”
 
“to-night supper,” said carver, “the shortcomings dinner
 shall made good, lordship shall fully contented.”
 
“god grant it,” said sancho.
 
farmer now came in, well-favoured man one might see a
 thousand leagues honest fellow good soul. first
 thing said was, “which lord governor here?”
 
“which be,” said secretary, “but seated the
 chair?”
 
“then humble him,” said farmer; going his
 knees asked hand, kiss it. sancho refused it, bade
 stand say wanted. farmer obeyed, said,
 “i farmer, señor, native miguelturra, village two leagues
 ciudad real.”
 
“another tirteafuera!” said sancho; “say on, brother; know
 miguelturra well can tell you, it’s far own
 town.”
 
“the case this, señor,” continued farmer, “that god’s mercy i
 married leave licence holy roman catholic
 church; two sons, students, younger studying to
 become bachelor, elder licentiate; widower, my
 wife died, properly speaking, bad doctor killed my
 hands, giving purge child; had
 pleased god child born, boy, have
 put study doctor, might envy brothers the
 bachelor licentiate.”
 
“so wife died, killed, would
 now widower,” said sancho.
 
“no, señor, certainly not,” said farmer.
 
“we’ve got much settled,” said sancho; “get on, brother, it’s
 bed-time business-time.”
 
“well then,” said farmer, “this mine going a
 bachelor, fell love said town damsel called clara
 perlerina, daughter andres perlerino, rich farmer; this
 name perlerines come ancestry descent, but
 family paralytics, better name call

 fine thin that, lips might reeled, one might make skein
 them; different colour ordinary lips are
 wonderful, mottled, blue, green, purple—let lord
 governor pardon painting minutely charms who

 find amiss.”
 
“paint will,” said sancho; “i enjoy painting, i
 dined dessert taste your

“that still furnish,” said farmer; “but time will come
 may able now; can tell you, señor, i
 paint gracefulness tall figure, astonish
 you; impossible bent double knees

 stand she’d knock head ceiling; have
 given hand bachelor ere this, can’t stretch it
 out, it’s contracted; still one can see elegance fine
 make long furrowed nails.”
 
“that will do, brother,” said sancho; “consider painted her
 head foot; want now? come point without
 beating bush, scraps additions.”
 
“i want worship, señor,” said farmer, “to favour of
 giving letter recommendation girl’s father, begging him
 good let marriage take place, not
 ill-matched either gifts fortune nature; tell
 truth, señor governor, possessed devil, is
 day evil spirits torment three four times; and
 fallen fire, face puckered like
 piece parchment, eyes watery always running; he
 disposition angel, belabouring and
 pummelling he’d saint.”
 
“is anything else want, good man?” said sancho.
 
“there’s another thing i’d like,” said farmer, “but i’m afraid to
 mention it; however, must; can’t let be
 rotting breast, come may. mean, señor, i’d like your
 worship give three hundred six hundred ducats help my
 bachelor’s portion, help setting house; must, in
 short, live themselves, without subject interferences
 fathers-in-law.”
 
“just see there’s anything else you’d like,” said sancho, “and don’t
 hold back mentioning bashfulness modesty.”
 
“no, indeed not,” said farmer.
 
moment said governor started feet, seizing
 chair sitting exclaimed, “by that’s good, you
 ill-bred, boorish don bumpkin, don’t get and
 hide sight, i’ll lay head open chair.
 whoreson rascal, devil’s painter, hour

 government half day, want six hundred ducats
 already!”
 
carver made signs farmer leave room, did
 head down, appearance terror lest governor
 carry threats effect, rogue knew well how
 play part.
 
let us leave sancho wrath, peace all; and
 let us return don quixote, left face bandaged and

“for heaven’s sake, doña rodriguez, ails lady duchess?”
 asked don quixote.
 
“adjured way,” replied duenna, “i help answering the
 question telling whole truth. señor don quixote, you
 observed comeliness lady duchess, smooth complexion

don quixote hardly said this, chamber door flew open with
 loud bang, start noise gave doña rodriguez let
 candle fall hand, room left dark a
 wolf’s mouth, saying is. suddenly poor duenna felt two hands
 seize throat, tightly croak, while
 someone else, without uttering word, briskly hoisted her
 petticoats, seemed slipper began lay so
 heartily anyone felt pity her; although don
 quixote felt never stirred bed, lay quiet and
 silent, nay apprehensive turn drubbing might coming.
 apprehension idle one; leaving duenna (who did

“of truth, señor governor,” said carver, “your worship the
 right everything said; promise name
 inhabitants island will serve worship

“that believe,” said sancho; “and great fools they

“there much worship says, señor governor,” said the
 majordomo, “that filled wonder see man like your

 all), say things, full sound maxims sage remarks,
 different expected worship’s intelligence by

 new world; jokes become realities, jokers find the
 tables turned upon them.”
 
night came, permission doctor pedro recio, governor
 supper. got ready go rounds, started with
 majordomo, secretary, head-carver, chronicler charged
 recording deeds, alguacils notaries enough form a
 fair-sized squadron. midst marched sancho staff, as
 fine sight one wish see, streets the
 town traversed heard noise clashing of
 swords. hastened spot, found combatants were
 two, seeing authorities approaching stood still, one of
 exclaimed, “help, name god king! men be
 allowed rob middle town, rush attack
 people streets?”
 
“be calm, good man,” said sancho, “and tell cause of
 quarrel is; governor.”
 
said combatant, “señor governor, will tell very
 words. worship must know gentleman just now won

“what say this?” asked sancho. replied his

 expected presents civil take given them
 cheerful countenance, make claim winners

 honest man refused give anything; for
 sharpers always pay tribute lookers-on know them.
 
“that true,” said majordomo; “let worship consider is
 done men.”
 
“what done,” said sancho, “is this; you, winner, you
 good, bad, indifferent, give assailant hundred reals
 once, must disburse thirty poor prisoners; and
 neither profession property, hang island

 to-morrow quit island sentence banishment ten years,
 pain completing another life violate the
 sentence, i’ll hang gibbet, least hangman will

one paid money took it, latter
 quitted island, went home; governor
 said, “either good much, i’ll get rid gambling
 houses, strikes mischievous.”
 
“this one least,” said one notaries, “your worship will not
 able get rid of, great man owns it, loses every
 year beyond comparison makes cards. on
 minor gambling houses worship may exercise power, it
 harm shelter barefaced practices; for
 houses lords gentlemen quality notorious sharpers
 dare attempt play tricks; vice gambling has
 become common, better men play houses repute
 tradesman’s, catch unlucky fellow the
 small hours morning skin alive.”
 
“i know already, notary, good deal said that
 point,” said sancho.
 
now tipstaff came young man grasp, said,
 “señor governor, youth coming towards us, soon he
 saw officers justice turned ran like deer, sure
 proof must evil-doer; ran him, not
 stumbled fell, never caught him.”
 
“what run for, fellow?” said sancho.
 
young man replied, “señor, avoid answering all
 questions officers justice put.”
 
“what trade?”
 
“a weaver.”
 
“and weave?”
 
“lance heads, worship’s good leave.”
 
“you’re facetious me! plume wag? very
 good; going just now?”
 
“to take air, señor.”
 
“and one take air island?”
 
“where blows.”
 
“good! answers much point; smart youth;
 take notice air, blow upon a-stern,
 send gaol. ho there! lay hold take off; i’ll
 make sleep to-night without air.”
 
“by god,” said young man, “your worship will make sleep gaol
 just soon make king.”
 
“why shan’t make thee sleep gaol?” said sancho. “have the
 power arrest thee release thee whenever like?”
 
“all power worship has,” said young man, “won’t able to
 make sleep gaol.”
 
“how? able!” said sancho; “take away he’ll see
 mistake eyes, even gaoler willing exert
 interested generosity behalf; i’ll lay penalty two
 thousand ducats allows stir step the
 prison.”
 
“that’s ridiculous,” said young man; “the fact is, men on
 earth will make sleep prison.”
 
“tell me, devil,” said sancho, “have got angel will
 deliver you, take irons going order put
 upon you?”
 
“now, señor governor,” said young man sprightly manner, “let
 us reasonable come point. granted worship may order
 taken prison, irons chains put me, and
 shut cell, may lay heavy penalties gaoler if
 lets out, obeys orders; still, don’t choose
 sleep, choose remain awake night without closing eye,
 will worship power able make sleep i
 don’t choose?”
 
“no, truly,” said secretary, “and fellow made point.”
 
“so then,” said sancho, “it entirely choice you
 keep sleeping; opposition will?”
 
“no, señor,” said youth, “certainly not.”
 
“well then, go, god you,” said sancho; “be home to
 sleep, god give sound sleep, don’t want rob it;
 future, let advise don’t joke authorities,
 may come across someone will bring joke on
 skull.”
 
young man went way, governor continued round, and
 shortly afterwards two tipstaffs came man custody, and
 said, “señor governor, person, seems man, so,
 woman, ill-favoured one, man’s clothes.” they
 raised two three lanterns face, light they

 ornamented dagger, fingers several handsome rings.
 short, girl seemed fair look eyes all, none
 beheld knew her, people town said they

 jokes practised upon sancho ones were
 surprised, incident discovery arranged by
 them; watched anxiously see affair end.
 
sancho fascinated girl’s beauty, asked she

 garb. eyes fixed ground answered modest
 confusion, “i tell you, señor, many people is
 consequence kept secret; one thing wish be
 known, thief evildoer, unhappy maiden whom
 power jealousy led break respect due
 modesty.”
 
hearing majordomo said sancho, “make people stand back,
 señor governor, lady may say wishes less
 embarrassment.”
 
sancho gave order, except majordomo, head-carver,
 secretary fell back. finding presence no
 more, damsel went say, “i daughter, sirs, pedro
 perez mazorca, wool-farmer town, habit of
 coming often father’s house.”
 
“that won’t do, señora,” said majordomo; “for know pedro perez
 well, know child all, either daughter;
 besides, though say father, add he
 comes often father’s house.”
 
“i already noticed that,” said sancho.
 
“i confused just now, sirs,” said damsel, “and don’t know what
 saying; truth daughter diego la

“ay, will do,” said majordomo; “for know diego llana,

“it true,” said damsel, “and daughter; whether report

seeing secretary leant head-carver’s ear, and
 said low voice, “something serious doubt happened
 poor maiden, goes wandering home dress and
 hour, one rank too.” “there can doubt about
 it,” returned carver, “and moreover tears confirm your
 suspicion.” sancho gave best comfort could, entreated
 tell without fear happened her, would
 earnestly every means power endeavour relieve

“the fact is, sirs,” said she, “that father kept shut up

“proceed, señora,” said majordomo, “and finish story what

“i little say, though many tear shed,” said the
 damsel; “for ill-placed desires can paid way.”
 
maiden’s beauty made deep impression head-carver’s
 heart, raised lantern another look her, and
 thought tears shedding, seed-pearl dew of

 patience length time girl taking tell story,
 told keep waiting longer; late, and
 still remained good deal town gone over.
 
she, broken sobs half-suppressed sighs, went say, “my

“nothing happened me,” said she, “nor jealousy brought

sancho made answer, “indeed gentlemen judges that

querist repeated said before, then
 sancho said, “it seems can set matter right moment,

sancho complied, ricote spoken pilgrims they
 withdrew grove saw, turning considerable distance of
 road. threw staves, took pilgrim’s cloaks
 remained under-clothing; good-looking young
 fellows, except ricote, man somewhat advanced years. they
 carried alforjas them, apparently well filled, least
 things provocative thirst, summon two
 leagues off. stretched ground, making a
 tablecloth grass spread upon bread, salt, knives,
 walnut, scraps cheese, well-picked ham-bones were
 past gnawing past sucking. also put black dainty

 thirst-wakener. lack olives, dry, true, and
 without seasoning, toothsome pleasant. but

 leisurely, making morsel—very small ones of
 everything—they took point knife; the
 moment raised arms botas aloft, mouths placed in
 mouths, eyes fixed heaven just taking
 aim it; attitude remained ever long, wagging
 heads side side acknowledgment pleasure
 enjoying decanted bowels bottles into
 stomachs.
 
sancho beheld all, “and nothing gave pain;” far that,
 acting proverb knew well, “when thou art rome as
 thou seest,” asked ricote bota took aim like rest of
 them, less enjoyment. four times botas bear being
 uplifted, fifth vain, drier and
 sapless rush time, made jollity had

every now someone grasp sancho’s right hand in

 answer, “bon compaño, jur di!” go fit of

 anything befallen government; cares very
 little sway us eating drinking. length, the
 wine come end them, drowsiness began come over
 them, dropped asleep table tablecloth.
 ricote sancho alone remained awake, eaten and
 drunk less, ricote drawing sancho aside, seated at
 foot beech, leaving pilgrims buried sweet sleep; and
 without falling morisco tongue ricote spoke as
 follows pure castilian:
 
“thou knowest well, neighbour friend sancho panza, the
 proclamation edict majesty commanded issued those
 nation filled us terror dismay; least did,
 insomuch think time granted us quitting spain was
 out, full force penalty already fallen upon upon
 children. decided, then, think wisely (just like one who
 knows certain date house lives will taken from
 him, looks beforehand another change into), decided, i
 say, leave town myself, alone without family, go to
 seek place remove comfortably the
 hurried way others took departure; saw very
 plainly, older men among us, proclamations
 mere threats, said, positive enactments which
 enforced appointed time; made believe this
 knew base extravagant designs people
 harboured, designs nature think divine
 inspiration moved majesty carry resolution so
 spirited; guilty, true and

 not; prudent cherish viper
 bosom enemies house. short just
 cause visited penalty banishment, mild and
 lenient one eyes some, us terrible could

 reception unhappy condition needs; barbary the
 parts africa counted upon received, succoured, and
 welcomed, insult ill-treat us most. knew not
 good fortune lost it; longing almost

 know language, many do, come back leave
 wives children forsaken yonder, great love for
 it; now know experience meaning saying, sweet is
 love one’s country.
 
“i left village, said, went france, though they
 gave us kind reception anxious see could. i
 crossed italy, reached germany, seemed we
 might live freedom, inhabitants pay any
 attention trifling points; everyone lives likes, most
 parts enjoy liberty conscience. took house town near
 augsburg, joined pilgrims, habit of

 away treasure left buried, which, outside town,
 shall able without risk, write, cross from
 valencia, daughter wife, know algiers, find
 means bringing french port thence germany,
 await may god’s will us; for, all,
 sancho, know well ricota daughter francisca ricota my
 wife catholic christians, though much so, still i
 christian moor, always prayer god
 will open eyes understanding show to
 serve him; amazes understand wife
 daughter gone barbary rather france, where
 live christians.”
 
sancho replied, “remember, ricote, may open

 true moor went go easily; another thing i
 can tell thee, belief thou art going vain look what
 thou hast left buried, heard took thy brother-in-law

“that may be,” said ricote; “but know touch hoard,
 tell was, fear accidents; so, if
 thou wilt come me, sancho, help take away conceal
 it, will give thee two hundred crowns wherewith thou mayest relieve
 thy necessities, and, thou knowest, know many.”
 
“i it,” said sancho; “but covetous, gave
 office morning which, was, might made the
 walls house gold dined silver plates six months
 over; reason, feel guilty
 treason king helped enemies, go thee
 instead promising two hundred crowns thou wert give four
 hundred hand.”
 
“and office thou hast given up, sancho?” asked ricote.
 
“i given governor island,” said sancho, “and a
 one, faith, won’t find like easily.”
 
“and island?” said ricote.
 
“where?” said sancho; “two leagues here, called the
 island barataria.”
 
“nonsense! sancho,” said ricote; “islands away sea;
 islands mainland.”
 
“what? islands!” said sancho; “i tell thee, friend ricote, left it
 morning, yesterday governing pleased like a
 sagittarius; gave up, seemed a
 dangerous office, governor’s.”
 
“and hast thou gained government?” asked ricote.
 
“i gained,” said sancho, “the knowledge good for
 governing, unless drove cattle, riches are
 got governments got cost one’s rest and
 sleep, ay even one’s food; islands governors must eat
 little, especially doctors look health.”
 
“i don’t understand thee, sancho,” said ricote; “but seems all
 nonsense thou art talking. give thee islands govern? is
 scarcity world cleverer men thou art for
 governors? hold thy peace, sancho, come back thy senses, and
 consider whether thou wilt come said help take
 away treasure left buried (for indeed may called treasure, it
 large), will give thee wherewithal keep thee, told
 thee.”
 
“and told thee already, ricote, will not,” said sancho;
 “let content thee thou shalt betrayed, go thy
 way god’s name let go mine; know well-gotten gain
 may lost, ill-gotten gain lost, owner
 likewise.”
 
“i will press thee, sancho,” said ricote; “but tell me, wert thou
 village wife daughter brother-in-law left it?”
 
“i so,” said sancho; “and can tell thee thy daughter left it
 looking lovely village turned see her, and
 everybody said fairest creature world. wept as
 went, embraced friends acquaintances who
 came see her, begged commend god and
 lady mother, touching way made me
 weep myself, though i’m much given tears commonly; and, faith,
 many one liked hide her, go carry on
 road; fear going king’s command kept them
 back. one showed moved don pedro gregorio, the
 rich young heir thou knowest of, say deep love with
 her; since left seen village again, and
 suspect gone steal away, far
 nothing heard it.”
 
“i always suspicion gentleman passion my
 daughter,” said ricote; “but felt sure ricota’s virtue it
 gave uneasiness know loved her; thou must have
 heard said, sancho, morisco women seldom never engage in
 amours old christians; daughter, fancy thought
 christian lovemaking, trouble herself
 attentions heir.”
 
“god grant it,” said sancho, “for bad business both
 them; now let off, friend ricote, want reach
 master don quixote to-night.”
 
“god thee, brother sancho,” said ricote; “my comrades are
 beginning stir, time, too, us continue our
 journey;” embraced, sancho mounted dapple, and
 ricote leant upon staff, parted.

struck don quixote voice sancho panza heard,
 whereat taken aback amazed, raising voice as
 much could, cried out, “who there? that
 complaining?”
 
“who here, complain,” answer, “but the
 forlorn sancho panza, sins ill-luck governor the
 island barataria, squire famous knight don quixote
 mancha?”
 
don quixote heard amazement redoubled his
 perturbation grew greater ever, suggested his
 mind sancho must dead, soul torment down
 there; carried away idea exclaimed, “i conjure thee by
 everything catholic christian can conjure thee by, tell me
 thou art; thou art soul torment, tell thou

“in case,” answered voice, “your worship speaks must
 master don quixote mancha; nay, tone voice
 plain can nobody else.”
 
“don quixote am,” replied don quixote, “he whose profession to
 aid succour living dead necessities; wherefore
 tell thou art, thou art keeping suspense; because, if
 thou art squire sancho panza, art dead, since devils have
 carried thee off, thou art god’s mercy purgatory, our
 holy mother roman catholic church intercessory means sufficient
 release thee pains thou art in; part will
 plead end, far substance will go; without

“by that’s good,” answer, “and birth whomsoever

 squire sancho panza, never died life;
 that, given government reasons require
 time explain, fell last night pit now,
 dapple witness won’t let lie, token is

“famous testimony!” exclaimed don quixote; “i know bray well as
 mother, thy voice too, sancho. wait go to

 thee pit thy sins doubt brought thee.”
 
“go, worship,” said sancho, “and come back quick god’s sake;
 bear buried alive longer, i’m dying of

don quixote left him, hastened castle tell duke and
 duchess happened sancho, little astonished

 confirmatory circumstance cave existence there

 government without receiving intimation coming. be
 brief, fetched ropes tackle, saying is, dint of
 many hands much labour drew dapple sancho panza of
 darkness light day. student saw remarked,
 “that’s way bad governors come governments,
 sinner comes depths pit, dead hunger,
 pale, suppose without farthing.”
 
sancho overheard said, “it eight ten days, brother
 growler, since entered upon government island gave
 me, time never bellyful victuals, an
 hour; doctors persecuted enemies crushed bones; any
 opportunity taking bribes levying taxes; case,
 is, don’t deserve, think, come fashion; but
 ‘man proposes god disposes;’ god knows best, what
 suits one best; ‘as occasion, behaviour;’ ‘let
 nobody say “i won’t drink water;”’ ‘where one thinks there
 flitches, pegs;’ god knows meaning that’s
 enough; say more, though could.”
 
“be angry annoyed thou hearest, sancho,” said don
 quixote, “or will never end it; keep safe conscience
 let say like; trying stop slanderers’ tongues
 like trying put gates open plain. governor comes out
 government rich, say thief; comes
 poor, noodle blockhead.”
 
“they’ll pretty sure time,” said sancho, “to set a
 fool rather thief.”
 
thus talking, surrounded boys crowd people, they
 reached castle, one corridors duke duchess
 stood waiting them; sancho go see duke
 first put dapple stable, said had
 passed bad night last quarters; went upstairs to
 see lord lady, kneeling said, “because it
 highnesses’ pleasure, desert own, i
 went govern island barataria, ‘i entered naked, and
 naked find myself; neither lose gain.’ whether governed

 answered questions, decided causes, always dying of
 hunger, doctor pedro recio tirteafuera, island governor
 doctor, so. enemies attacked us night put us a
 great quandary, people island say came safe and
 victorious might arm; may god give much health
 there’s truth say. short, time have
 weighed cares responsibilities governing brings it, by
 reckoning find shoulders can’t bear them, load
 loins arrows quiver; so, government

 try fill pocket; though meant make useful laws, i
 made hardly any, afraid kept; that

 trembling, rate take fill; part, long i’m

sancho brought long speech end, don quixote been

 found leave few, thanked heaven heart. the
 duke embraced sancho told heartily sorry given up
 government soon, see provided with
 post estate less onerous profitable. the
 duchess also embraced him, gave orders taken good

 fixed battle arrived, duke, having
 repeatedly instructed lacquey tosilos deal don quixote
 vanquish without killing wounding him, gave orders to
 heads removed lances, telling don quixote that
 christian charity, plumed himself, suffer the
 battle fought much risk danger life; he
 must content offer battlefield territory

 prohibits challenges sort) push arduous
 venture extreme limits. don quixote bade excellence arrange

 duke ordered spacious stand erected facing court

 apportioned sun them, stationed them, spot where

 full anxiety, hoping happy issue, apprehensive an
 untoward ending affair, lastly, don quixote, commending
 heart god lord lady dulcinea del
 toboso, stood waiting give necessary signal the

 thought now going mention.
 
seems stood contemplating enemy struck the
 beautiful woman ever seen life; little
 blind boy streets commonly call love mind to
 let slip chance triumphing lacquey heart, adding it
 list trophies; so, stealing gently upon unseen,
 drove dart two yards long poor lacquey’s left side and
 pierced heart through; able quite at
 ease, love invisible, comes goes likes,
 without anyone calling account does. well then, when
 gave signal onset lacquey ecstasy,
 musing upon beauty already made mistress his
 liberty, paid attention sound trumpet,
 unlike don quixote, instant heard it, and, the
 highest speed rocinante capable of, set meet enemy, his
 good squire sancho shouting lustily saw start, “god guide
 thee, cream flower knights-errant! god give thee victory,
 thou hast right thy side!” though tosilos saw don
 quixote coming never stirred step spot he
 posted; instead called loudly marshal the
 field, came see wanted said, “señor,
 battle decide whether marry marry that
 lady?” “just so,” answer. “well then,” said lacquey, “i
 feel qualms conscience, lay heavy burden upon i
 proceed combat; therefore declare i
 yield vanquished, willing marry lady at

marshal field lost astonishment words of
 tosilos; one privy arrangement
 affair knew say reply. don quixote pulled up
 mid career saw enemy coming the
 attack. duke make reason battle not
 go on; marshal field hastened let know
 tosilos said, amazed extremely angry it. the
 meantime tosilos advanced doña rodriguez sat said a
 loud voice, “señora, willing marry daughter, no

 without risk life.”
 
valiant don quixote heard him, said, “as case am
 released absolved promise; let marry means, and
 ‘god lord given her, may saint peter add blessing.’”
 
duke now descended courtyard castle, going up
 tosilos said him, “is true, sir knight, yield
 vanquished, moved scruples conscience wish
 marry damsel?”
 
“it is, señor,” replied tosilos.
 
“and well,” said sancho, “for thou hast give the

tosilos meanwhile trying unlace helmet, begged them
 come help once, power breathing failing him,
 remain long shut confined space. they
 removed haste, lacquey features revealed to
 public gaze. sight doña rodriguez daughter raised a
 mighty outcry, exclaiming, “this trick! trick! have
 put tosilos, lord duke’s lacquey, upon us place real
 husband. justice god king trickery, to
 say roguery!”
 
“do distress yourselves, ladies,” said don quixote; “for no
 trickery roguery; is, duke the
 bottom it, wicked enchanters persecute me, who,
 jealous reaping glory victory, turned your
 husband’s features person, say lacquey
 duke’s; take advice, notwithstanding malice my
 enemies marry him, beyond doubt one wish a

duke heard anger near vanishing fit of
 laughter, said, “the things happen señor don quixote are
 extraordinary ready believe lacquey mine not

“oh, señor,” said sancho, “those scoundrels well used changing
 whatever concerns master one thing another. knight that

rodriguez’s daughter exclaimed, “let may, this
 man claims wife; thankful same, i
 rather lawful wife lacquey cheated mistress of

duchess gave wife’s letters sancho panza, shed tears
 them, saying, “who thought grand hopes the
 news government bred wife teresa panza’s breast end
 going back now vagabond adventures master don

 good turn done show gratitude, it’s only
 trifle. went government naked, come
 naked; can say safe conscience—and that’s no
 small matter—‘naked born, naked find myself, neither lose nor

thus sancho soliloquise day departure, don
 quixote, night taken leave duke duchess,
 coming made appearance early hour full armour the
 courtyard castle. whole household castle were
 watching corridors, duke duchess, too, came
 see him. sancho mounted dapple, alforjas,
 valise, proven supremely happy duke’s majordomo, the
 acted part trifaldi, given little
 purse two hundred gold crowns meet necessary expenses of
 road, don quixote knew nothing yet. were,
 said, observing him, suddenly among duennas and
 handmaidens impudent witty altisidora lifted voice and
 said pathetic tones:

unhappy altisidora bewailing above
 strain don quixote stood staring her; without uttering word in
 reply turned round sancho said, “sancho friend, i
 conjure thee life thy forefathers tell truth; say,
 hast thou chance taken three kerchiefs garters this
 love-sick maid speaks of?”
 
sancho made answer, “the three kerchiefs have; the
 garters, much ‘over hills Úbeda.’”
 
duchess amazed altisidora’s assurance; knew was
 bold, lively, impudent, much venture make
 free fashion; prepared joke, her
 astonishment greater. duke mind keep the
 sport, said, “it seem well done you, sir
 knight, received hospitality been
 offered castle, ventured carry off
 even three kerchiefs, say handmaid’s garters. shows bad
 heart tally reputation. restore garters, or
 else defy mortal combat, afraid rascally
 enchanters changing altering features changed who
 encountered lacquey, tosilos.”
 
“god forbid,” said don quixote, “that draw sword against
 illustrious person received great favours.
 kerchiefs will restore, sancho says them; the
 garters impossible, got them, neither he;
 handmaiden will look hiding-places, depend upon
 will find them. never thief, lord duke, do
 mean long live, god cease his
 keeping. damsel confession speaks one love, for
 blame, therefore need ask pardon, either of
 excellence, entreat better opinion of
 me, give leave pursue journey.”
 
“and may god prosper it, señor don quixote,” said duchess, “that
 may always hear good news exploits; god speed you; the
 longer stay, inflame hearts damsels who
 behold you; one mine, will chastise that
 will transgress again, either eyes words.”
 
“one word more, valiant don quixote, ask hear,” said

don quixote saw open country, free, relieved from
 attentions altisidora, felt ease, fresh spirits
 take pursuit chivalry more; turning sancho, he
 said, “freedom, sancho, one precious gifts heaven
 bestowed upon men; treasures earth holds buried the
 conceals can compare it; freedom, honour, life may
 ventured; hand, captivity the
 greatest evil can fall lot man. say this, sancho,
 thou hast seen good cheer, abundance enjoyed in
 castle leaving; well then, amid dainty banquets and
 snow-cooled beverages felt though undergoing straits of
 hunger, enjoy freedom they
 mine own; sense obligation return
 benefits favours received restraint checks the
 independence spirit. happy he, heaven given piece
 bread bound give thanks heaven
 itself!”
 
“for worship says,” said sancho, “it becoming that
 thanks part two hundred gold crowns that
 duke’s majordomo given little purse carry next
 heart, like warming plaster comforter, meet chance
 calls; shan’t always find castles they’ll entertain us;
 now may light upon roadside inns they’ll cudgel us.”
 
conversation sort knight squire errant pursuing
 journey, when, gone little half a
 league, perceived dozen men dressed like labourers stretched
 upon cloaks grass green meadow eating dinner.
 beside seemed white sheets concealing some
 objects them, standing upright lying flat, arranged at
 intervals. don quixote approached diners, and, saluting them
 courteously first, asked cloths covered.
 “señor,” answered one party, “under cloths images
 carved relief intended retablo putting our
 village; carry covered may soiled, on
 shoulders may broken.”
 
“with good leave,” said don quixote, “i like see them;
 images carried carefully doubt must fine ones.”
 
“i think were!” said other; “let money cost
 speak that; matter fact one that
 stand us fifty ducats; worship may
 judge; wait moment, shall see eyes;” and
 getting dinner went uncovered first image, which
 proved one saint george horseback serpent writhing
 feet lance thrust throat that
 fierceness usually depicted. whole group one blaze of
 gold, saying is. seeing don quixote said, “that knight was
 one best knights-errant army heaven ever owned; was
 called don saint george, moreover defender maidens. let
 us see next one.”
 
man uncovered it, seen saint martin his
 horse, dividing cloak beggar. instant don quixote saw
 said, “this knight one christian adventurers, but
 believe generous rather valiant, thou mayest perceive,
 sancho, dividing cloak beggar giving half
 it; doubt winter time, otherwise have
 given whole it, charitable he.”
 
“it that, likely,” said sancho, “but held the
 proverb says, ‘for giving keeping there’s need brains.’”
 
don quixote laughed, asked take next cloth,
 underneath seen image patron saint spains
 seated horseback, sword stained blood, trampling moors
 treading heads underfoot; seeing don quixote exclaimed,
 “ay, knight, squadrons christ! one is
 called don saint james moorslayer, one bravest saints and
 knights world ever heaven now.”
 
raised another cloth appeared covered saint paul
 falling horse, details usually given in
 representations conversion. don quixote saw it, rendered in
 lifelike style one said christ speaking and
 paul answering, “this,” said, “was time greatest enemy
 church god lord had, greatest champion will
 ever have; knight-errant life, steadfast saint death, an
 untiring labourer lord’s vineyard, teacher gentiles,
 whose school heaven, whose instructor master jesus
 christ himself.”
 
images, don quixote bade cover up
 again, said brought them, “i take happy
 omen, brothers, seen have; saints knights
 profession myself, calling arms;
 difference me, were
 saints, fought divine weapons, sinner fight
 human ones. won heaven force arms, heaven suffereth
 violence; i, far, know won dint my
 sufferings; dulcinea toboso released from
 hers, perhaps mended fortunes mind restored i
 might direct steps better path following present.”
 
“may god hear deaf,” said sancho this.
 
men filled wonder, well figure words
 don quixote, though understand one half he
 meant them. finished dinner, took images their
 backs, bidding farewell don quixote resumed journey.
 
sancho amazed afresh extent master’s knowledge, as
 much never known him, seemed was
 story event world fingers’ ends and
 fixed memory, said him, “in truth, master mine, if
 happened us to-day called adventure, it
 one sweetest pleasantest befallen us in
 whole course travels; come unbelaboured
 undismayed, neither drawn sword smitten the
 earth bodies, left famishing; blessed god
 let see thing eyes!”
 
“thou sayest well, sancho,” said don quixote, “but remember times
 alike always run way; things the
 vulgar commonly call omens, based upon natural
 reason, will wise esteemed reckoned happy
 accidents merely. one believers omens will get a
 morning, leave house, meet friar order blessed
 saint francis, and, met griffin, will turn and
 go home. another mendoza salt spilt table, gloom
 spilt heart, nature obliged give warning of
 coming misfortunes means trivial things these. wise
 man christian trifle may please heaven
 do. scipio coming africa stumbled leaped shore; his
 soldiers took bad omen; he, clasping soil his
 arms, exclaimed, ‘thou canst escape me, africa, hold thee
 tight arms.’ thus, sancho, meeting images to
 happy occurrence.”
 
“i can well believe it,” said sancho; “but wish worship would
 tell reason spaniards, to
 give battle, calling saint james moorslayer, say
 ‘santiago close spain!’ spain, then, open, needful
 close it; meaning form?”
 
“thou art simple, sancho,” said don quixote; “god, look you, gave
 great knight red cross spain patron saint and
 protector, especially hard struggles spaniards with
 moors; therefore invoke call upon their
 defender battles; many time
 seen beating down, trampling foot, destroying slaughtering
 hagarene squadrons sight all; fact give
 thee many examples recorded truthful spanish histories.”
 
sancho changed subject, said master, “i marvel, señor,
 boldness altisidora, duchess’s handmaid; they
 call love must cruelly pierced wounded her; say a
 little blind urchin who, though blear-eyed, properly speaking
 sightless, aims heart, ever small, hits and
 pierces arrows. heard said
 arrows love blunted robbed points by
 maidenly modesty reserve; altisidora seems they
 sharpened rather blunted.”
 
“bear mind, sancho,” said don quixote, “that love influenced by
 consideration, recognises restraints reason, the
 nature death, assails alike lofty palaces kings and
 humble cabins shepherds; takes entire possession of
 heart, first thing banish fear shame it;
 without shame altisidora declared passion, excited in
 mind embarrassment rather commiseration.”
 
“notable cruelty!” exclaimed sancho; “unheard-of ingratitude! can
 say smallest loving word would
 subdued made slave me. devil! heart of
 marble, bowels brass, soul mortar! can’t
 imagine damsel saw worship have
 conquered captivated so. gallant figure it, bold
 bearing, sprightly grace, comeliness feature, of

 love you? indeed truth many time stop look at
 worship sole foot topmost hair your
 head, see frighten one make one fall love;
 moreover heard say beauty first main thing that
 excites love, worship none all, don’t know what
 poor creature fell love with.”
 
“recollect, sancho,” replied don quixote, “there two sorts of
 beauty, one mind, body; mind
 displays exhibits intelligence, modesty, honourable
 conduct, generosity, good breeding; qualities are
 possible may exist ugly man; sort of
 beauty body attraction, love apt to
 spring suddenly violently. i, sancho, perceive clearly enough
 beautiful, time know hideous;
 enough honest man monster object
 love, possesses endowments mind mentioned.”
 
engaged discourse making way a
 wood lay beyond road, suddenly, without expecting
 anything kind, don quixote found caught nets of
 green cord stretched one tree another; unable conceive

spectacle filled sancho amazement, fascinated
 don quixote, made sun halt course behold them, held
 four strange silence. one shepherdesses, length, was
 first speak said don quixote, “hold, sir knight, do
 break nets; spread harm,
 amusement; know will ask have
 put up, are, will tell words. a
 village two leagues this, many people of
 quality rich gentlefolk, agreed upon number friends
 relations come wives, sons daughters, neighbours,
 friends kinsmen, make holiday spot, one the
 pleasantest whole neighbourhood, setting new pastoral
 arcadia among ourselves, maidens dressing shepherdesses
 youths shepherds. prepared two eclogues, one the
 famous poet garcilasso, excellent camoens, its
 portuguese tongue, yet acted them. yesterday was
 first day coming here; say are
 called field-tents pitched among trees bank ample
 brook fertilises meadows; last night spread these
 nets trees snare silly little birds startled by
 noise make may fly them. please guest,
 señor, will welcomed heartily courteously, just now
 neither care sorrow shall enter.”
 
held peace said more, don quixote made answer, “of a
 truth, fairest lady, actaeon unexpectedly beheld diana bathing
 stream fascinated wonderstruck than
 sight beauty. commend mode entertainment,
 thank kindness invitation; can serve
 you, may command full confidence obeyed, my
 profession none show grateful, ready to
 serve persons conditions, especially persons quality such
 appearance indicates; if, instead taking up, they
 probably do, small space, nets took whole surface of
 globe, seek new worlds pass, not
 break them; ye may give degree credence this
 exaggerated language mine, know less don quixote
 mancha makes declaration you, indeed that
 name reached ears.”
 
“ah! friend soul,” instantly exclaimed shepherdess,
 “what great good fortune befallen us! seest thou gentleman we
 us? well let tell thee valiant and
 devoted courteous gentleman world,
 unless history achievements printed have
 read telling lies deceiving us. will lay wager this
 good fellow one sancho panza squire, whose
 drolleries none can equal.”
 
“that’s true,” said sancho; “i droll squire speak
 of, gentleman master don quixote mancha, same
 that’s history talk about.”
 
“oh, friend,” said other, “let us entreat stay; it
 will give fathers brothers infinite pleasure; heard
 just thou hast told valour one drolleries
 other; more, say most
 constant loyal lover ever heard of, lady is
 one dulcinea toboso, spain palm beauty is
 awarded.”
 
“and justly awarded,” said don quixote, “unless, indeed, your
 unequalled beauty makes matter doubt. spare the
 trouble, ladies, pressing stay, urgent calls my
 profession allow take rest circumstances.”
 
instant came spot four stood a
 brother one two shepherdesses, like shepherd costume,
 richly gaily dressed were. told their
 companion valiant don quixote mancha, other
 sancho squire, knew already read their
 history. gay shepherd offered services begged he
 accompany tents, don quixote give way and
 comply. now game started, nets filled a
 variety birds deceived colour fell danger they
 flying from. upwards thirty persons, gaily attired as
 shepherds shepherdesses, assembled spot, once
 informed don quixote squire were, whereat a
 little delighted, knew already history. they
 repaired tents, found tables laid out, choicely,
 plentifully, neatly furnished. treated don quixote person
 distinction, giving place honour, observed him,
 full astonishment spectacle. last cloth being
 removed, don quixote great composure lifted voice said:
 
“one greatest sins men guilty is—some will say
 pride—but say ingratitude, going common saying hell is
 full ingrates. sin, far lain power, have
 endeavoured avoid ever since enjoyed faculty reason;
 unable requite good deeds done by
 deeds, substitute desire so; not
 enough make known publicly; declares makes known
 good deeds done repay others his
 power, part receive inferiors of
 give. thus, god superior supreme
 giver, offerings man fall short infinite distance of
 full return gifts god; gratitude degree
 makes deficiency shortcoming. therefore, grateful for
 favour extended here, unable make a
 return measure, restricted narrow limits of
 power, offer can offer way; and
 declare two full days will maintain middle of
 highway leading saragossa, ladies disguised as
 shepherdesses, present, fairest courteous
 maidens world, excepting peerless dulcinea toboso,
 sole mistress thoughts, said without offence who
 hear me, ladies gentlemen.”
 
hearing sancho, listening great attention,
 cried loud voice, “is possible anyone world
 will dare say swear master mine madman?
 say, gentlemen shepherds, village priest, ever wise
 learned, say master said; there
 knight-errant, whatever renown may man valour, that
 offer master offered now?”
 
don quixote turned upon sancho, countenance glowing with
 anger said him, “is possible, sancho, anyone the
 whole world will say thou art fool, lining match,
 know trimmings impertinence roguery? asked
 thee meddle affairs, inquire whether wise man or
 blockhead? hold thy peace; answer word; saddle rocinante if
 unsaddled; let us go put offer execution; with
 right side thou mayest reckon vanquished all
 shall venture question it;” great rage, showing his
 anger plainly, rose seat, leaving company lost in
 wonder, making feel doubtful whether regard him
 madman rational being. end, though sought to
 dissuade involving challenge, assuring him
 admitted gratitude fully established, needed fresh
 proofs convinced valiant spirit, related the
 history exploits sufficient, still don quixote persisted in
 resolve; mounted rocinante, bracing buckler arm
 grasping lance, posted middle high road
 far green meadow. sancho followed dapple,
 together members pastoral gathering, eager see
 upshot vainglorious extraordinary
 proposal.
 
don quixote, then, having, said, planted the
 middle road, made welkin ring words effect: “ho
 ye travellers wayfarers, knights, squires, folk foot on
 horseback, pass way shall pass course next
 two days! know don quixote mancha, knight-errant, posted
 maintain arms beauty courtesy enshrined the
 nymphs dwell meadows groves surpass upon earth,
 putting aside lady heart, dulcinea toboso. wherefore, let
 opposite opinion come on, await him.”
 
twice repeated words, twice fell unheard any
 adventurer; fate, guiding affairs better to
 better, ordered shortly afterwards appeared the
 road crowd men horseback, many lances their
 hands, riding compact body great haste. sooner had
 don quixote seen turned and
 withdrew distance road, knew they
 stayed harm might come them; don quixote intrepid
 heart stood ground, sancho panza shielded with
 rocinante’s hind-quarters. troop lancers came up, one of
 advance began shouting don quixote, “get the
 way, devil, bulls will knock pieces!”
 
“rabble!” returned don quixote, “i care nothing bulls, the
 fiercest jarama breeds banks. confess once, scoundrels, that
 declared true; else ye deal combat.”
 
herdsman time reply, don quixote get the
 way even wished; drove fierce bulls tame
 bullocks, together crowd herdsmen others were
 taking penned village run the
 next day, passed don quixote sancho, rocinante and
 dapple, hurling earth rolling the
 ground. sancho left crushed, don quixote scared, dapple belaboured
 rocinante sound condition.

got up, however, length, don quixote great haste,
 stumbling falling there, started running drove,
 shouting out, “hold! stay! ye rascally rabble, single knight awaits
 you, temper opinion say, ‘for a
 flying enemy make bridge silver.’” retreating party their
 haste, however, stop that, heed menaces more
 last year’s clouds. weariness brought don quixote halt, and
 enraged avenged sat road wait sancho,

“eat, sancho friend,” said don quixote; “support life, of
 consequence thee me, leave die pain
 thoughts pressure misfortunes. born, sancho, to
 live dying, thou die eating; prove truth i
 say, look me, printed histories, famed arms, courteous in
 behaviour, honoured princes, courted maidens; all, when
 looked forward palms, triumphs, crowns, won earned my
 valiant deeds, morning seen trampled on, kicked, and
 crushed feet unclean filthy animals. thought blunts
 teeth, paralyses jaws, cramps hands, robs all
 appetite food; much mind let die of
 hunger, cruelest death deaths.”
 
“so then,” said sancho, munching hard time, “your worship does
 agree proverb says, ‘let martha die, let die
 full belly.’ i, rate, mind kill myself; far
 that, mean cobbler does, stretches leather
 teeth makes reach far wants. i’ll stretch
 life eating reaches end heaven fixed it;
 let tell you, señor, there’s greater folly think of
 dying despair worship does; take advice, eating
 lie sleep bit green grass-mattress, will see
 awake you’ll feel something better.”
 
don quixote recommended, struck sancho’s
 reasoning like philosopher’s blockhead’s, said
 he, “sancho, thou wilt going tell thee my
 ease mind assured heaviness heart so
 great; this; go aside little sleeping in
 accordance thy advice, and, making bare thy carcase air, to
 give thyself three four hundred lashes rocinante’s reins, on
 account three thousand odd thou art give thyself the
 disenchantment dulcinea; great pity poor lady
 left enchanted thy carelessness negligence.”
 
“there good deal said point,” said sancho; “let us
 go sleep now, that, god decreed will happen.
 let tell worship man whip cold blood
 hard thing, especially stripes fall upon ill-nourished
 worse-fed body. let lady dulcinea patience, is
 least expecting it, will see made riddle whipping, and
 ‘until death it’s life;’ mean still life me, and
 desire make good promised.”
 
don quixote thanked him, ate little, sancho good deal, and
 lay sleep, leaving two inseparable friends
 comrades, rocinante dapple, devices feed
 unrestrained upon abundant grass meadow was
 furnished. woke rather late, mounted resumed
 journey, pushing reach inn sight,
 apparently league off. say inn, don quixote called it
 so, contrary usual practice calling inns castles. they
 reached it, asked landlord put there. said
 yes, much comfort good fare find in
 saragossa. dismounted, sancho stowed away larder room
 landlord gave key. took beasts the
 stable, fed them, came back see orders don quixote, was
 seated bench door, him, giving special thanks to
 heaven inn taken castle master.
 supper-time came, repaired room, sancho asked the
 landlord give supper. landlord
 replied mouth measure; ask what
 would; inn provided birds air the
 fowls earth fish sea.
 
“there’s need that,” said sancho; “if they’ll roast us a
 couple chickens we’ll satisfied, master delicate and
 eats little, i’m gluttonous.”
 
landlord replied chickens, kites stolen them.
 
“well then,” said sancho, “let señor landlord tell roast a
 pullet, tender one.”
 
“pullet! father!” said landlord; “indeed truth it’s only
 yesterday sent fifty city sell; saving pullets ask
 will.”
 
“in case,” said sancho, “you will without veal kid.”
 
“just now,” said landlord, “there’s none house, it’s all
 finished; next week will enough spare.”
 
“much good us,” said sancho; “i’ll lay bet these
 short-comings going wind plenty bacon eggs.”
 
“by god,” said landlord, “my guest’s wits must precious dull; i
 tell neither pullets hens, wants eggs!
 talk dainties, please, don’t ask hens again.”
 
“body o’ me!” said sancho, “let’s settle matter; say what
 got, let us words it.”
 
“in truth earnest, señor guest,” said landlord, “all is
 couple cow-heels like calves’ feet, couple calves’ feet
 like cowheels; boiled chick-peas, onions, bacon, and
 moment crying ‘come eat me, come eat me.”
 
“i mark mine spot,” said sancho; “let nobody touch
 them; i’ll pay better anyone else, wish
 anything taste; don’t care pin whether are
 feet heels.”
 
“nobody shall touch them,” said landlord; “for guests i
 have, persons high quality, bring cook caterer
 larder them.”
 
“if come people quality,” said sancho, “there’s nobody more
 master; calling follows allow larders
 store-rooms; lay middle meadow, and
 fill acorns medlars.”
 
ended sancho’s conversation landlord, sancho caring
 carry farther answering him; already asked him
 calling profession master of.
 
supper-time come, then, don quixote betook room,
 landlord brought stew-pan just was, sat himself
 sup resolutely. seems another room, was
 next don quixote’s, nothing thin partition separate
 it, overheard words, “as live, señor don jeronimo, while
 bringing supper, let us read another chapter second
 part ‘don quixote mancha.’”
 
instant don quixote heard name started feet and
 listened open ears catch said him, heard
 don jeronimo addressed say reply, “why you
 us read absurd stuff, don juan, impossible for
 anyone read first part history ‘don quixote la
 mancha’ take pleasure reading second part?”
 
“for that,” said addressed don juan, “we shall do
 well read it, book bad something good
 it. displeases represents don quixote
 now cured love dulcinea toboso.”
 
hearing don quixote, full wrath indignation, lifted up
 voice said, “whoever may says don quixote la
 mancha forgotten can forget dulcinea toboso, will teach
 equal arms says far truth; for
 neither can peerless dulcinea toboso forgotten, can
 forgetfulness place don quixote; motto constancy, and
 profession maintain life never wrong it.”
 
“who answers us?” said next room.
 
“who be,” said sancho, “but don quixote mancha himself,
 will make good said will say; pledges
 don’t trouble good payer.”
 
sancho hardly uttered words two gentlemen, they
 seemed be, entered room, one them, throwing arms
 round don quixote’s neck, said him, “your appearance leave
 question name, can name fail identify your
 appearance; unquestionably, señor, real don quixote la
 mancha, cynosure morning star knight-errantry, despite in
 defiance sought usurp name bring naught
 achievements, author book present to
 done;” put book companion carried
 hands don quixote, took it, without replying began
 run eye it; presently returned saying, “in the
 little seen discovered three things author that
 deserve censured. first words read the
 preface; next language aragonese, sometimes he
 writes without articles; third, stamps as
 ignorant, goes wrong departs truth most
 important part history, says squire sancho
 panza’s wife called mari gutierrez, called nothing of
 sort, teresa panza; man errs important
 point good reason fear error every
 point history.”
 
“a nice sort historian, indeed!” exclaimed sancho this; “he must
 know deal affairs calls wife teresa panza, mari
 gutierrez; take book again, señor, see he
 changed name.”
 
“from talk, friend,” said don jeronimo, “no doubt sancho
 panza, señor don quixote’s squire.”
 
“yes, am,” said sancho; “and i’m proud it.”
 
“faith, then,” said gentleman, “this new author handle you
 decency displays person; makes out
 heavy feeder fool, least droll, very
 different sancho described first part your
 master’s history.”
 
“god forgive him,” said sancho; “he might left corner
 without troubling head me; ‘let knows ring the
 bells; ‘saint peter well rome.’”
 
two gentlemen pressed don quixote come room have
 supper them, knew well nothing inn
 fit one sort. don quixote, always polite, yielded to
 request supped them. sancho stayed behind stew.
 invested plenary delegated authority seated the
 head table, landlord sat him, no
 less fond cow-heel calves’ feet sancho was.
 
supper don juan asked don quixote news lady
 dulcinea toboso, married, brought bed, or
 child, maidenhood, still preserving her
 modesty delicacy, cherish remembrance tender passion of
 señor don quixote?
 
replied, “dulcinea maiden still, passion more
 firmly rooted ever, intercourse unsatisfactory before, and
 beauty transformed foul country wench;” he
 proceeded give full particular account enchantment
 dulcinea, happened cave montesinos,
 together sage merlin prescribed her
 disenchantment, namely scourging sancho.
 
exceedingly great amusement two gentlemen derived from
 hearing don quixote recount strange incidents history; and
 amazed absurdities equally amazed the
 elegant style delivered them. one hand regarded
 man wit sense, seemed a
 maundering blockhead, make minds
 whereabouts wisdom folly place him.
 
sancho finished supper, left landlord x
 condition, repaired room master was, came in
 said, “may die, sirs, author book worships have
 got mind agree; calls glutton
 (according worships say) wish may call me
 drunkard too.”
 
“but does,” said don jeronimo; “i remember, however, what
 way, though know words offensive, more, lying, as
 can see plainly physiognomy worthy sancho me.”
 
“believe me,” said sancho, “the sancho don quixote this
 history must different persons appear one
 cide hamete benengeli wrote, ourselves; master valiant,
 wise, true love, simple, droll, neither glutton nor
 drunkard.”
 
“i believe it,” said don juan; “and possible, order should
 issued one presumption deal anything
 relating don quixote, save original author cide hamete; just as
 alexander commanded one presume paint portrait

“let will paint me,” said don quixote; “but let abuse
 me; patience will often break heap insults upon it.”
 
“none can offered señor don quixote,” said don juan, “that he
 will able avenge, ward the
 shield patience, which, take it, great strong.”
 
considerable portion night passed conversation this
 sort, though don juan wished don quixote read book
 see about, prevailed upon, saying
 treated read pronounced utterly silly; and, by
 chance come author’s ears his

 read it; thoughts, still eyes, keep
 aloof obscene filthy.
 
asked whither meant direct steps. replied, to
 saragossa, take part harness jousts held that
 city every year. don juan told new history described how
 don quixote, let might, took part tilting at
 ring, utterly devoid invention, poor mottoes, poor in
 costume, though rich sillinesses.
 
“for reason,” said don quixote, “i will set foot in
 saragossa; means shall expose world lie of
 new history writer, people will see don
 quixote speaks of.”
 
“you will quite right,” said don jeronimo; “and other
 jousts barcelona señor don quixote may display his
 prowess.”
 
“that mean do,” said don quixote; “and now time,
 pray worships give leave retire bed, place
 retain among number greatest friends servants.”
 
“and too,” said sancho; “maybe i’ll good something.”
 
exchanged farewells, don quixote sancho retired

fresh morning giving promise cool day don quixote
 quitted inn, first taking care ascertain direct

 make new historian, said abused so, liar.
 well, fell out, nothing worthy recorded happened for
 six days, end which, turned aside road, he
 overtaken night thicket oak cork trees; this
 point cide hamete precise usually matters.
 
master man dismounted beasts, soon had
 settled foot trees, sancho, good
 noontide meal day, let himself, without ado, pass gates
 sleep. don quixote, thoughts, far hunger,
 kept awake, close eye, roamed fancy fro
 sorts places. one moment seemed was
 cave montesinos saw dulcinea, transformed country
 wench, skipping mounting upon she-ass; words of
 sage merlin sounding ears, setting forth conditions
 observed exertions made disenchantment of
 dulcinea. lost patience considered laziness want
 charity squire sancho; best belief had
 given five lashes, number paltry disproportioned to
 vast number required. thought felt vexation and
 anger reasoned matter thus: “if alexander great cut the
 gordian knot, saying, ‘to cut comes thing untie,’ and
 yet fail become lord paramount asia, neither nor
 less happen now dulcinea’s disenchantment scourge sancho
 will; for, condition remedy sancho
 shall receive three thousand odd lashes, matter me
 whether inflicts himself, someone else inflicts them, when
 essential point receives them, let come from
 whatever quarter may?”
 
idea went sancho, first taken rocinante’s
 reins arranged able flog them, and
 began untie points (the common belief one in
 front) breeches held up; instant he
 approached sancho woke full senses cried out, “what
 this? touching untrussing me?”
 
“it i,” said don quixote, “and come make good thy shortcomings

don antonio’s wife came said, “i know ask thee,
 head; seek know thee shall many years of
 enjoyment good husband;” answer received was, “thou
 shalt, vigour temperate habits promise many years of
 life, intemperance others often cut short.”
 
don quixote came forward said, “tell me, thou answerest,
 describe happened cave of
 montesinos truth dream? will sancho’s whipping accomplished
 without fail? will disenchantment dulcinea brought about?”

“as question cave,” reply, “there much be
 said; something it. sancho’s whipping will proceed
 leisurely. disenchantment dulcinea will attain due
 consummation.”
 
“i seek know more,” said don quixote; “let see dulcinea
 disenchanted, will consider good fortune could
 wish come upon once.”
 
last questioner sancho, questions were, “head, shall i
 chance another government? shall ever escape the
 hard life squire? shall get back see wife children?”
 answer came, “thou shalt govern thy house; thou
 returnest thou shalt see thy wife children; ceasing to
 serve thou shalt cease squire.”
 
“good, god!” said sancho panza; “i told that; the
 prophet perogrullo said more.”
 
“what answer wouldst thou have, beast?” said don quixote; “is not
 enough replies head given suit questions put to
 it?”
 
“yes, enough,” said sancho; “but liked have
 made plainer told more.”
 
questions answers came end here, wonder with
 filled, except don antonio’s two friends the
 secret. cide hamete benengeli thought fit reveal once, not
 keep world suspense, fancying head strange
 magical mystery it. says, therefore, model another
 head, work image maker, seen madrid, don
 antonio made one home amusement astonish
 ignorant people; mechanism follows. table of
 wood painted varnished imitate jasper, pedestal which
 stood material, four eagles’ claws projecting
 support weight steadily. head, resembled
 bust figure roman emperor, coloured like bronze, was
 hollow throughout, table, fitted so
 exactly trace joining visible. pedestal the
 table also hollow communicated throat neck the
 head, whole communication another room underneath
 chamber head stood. entire cavity the
 pedestal, table, throat neck bust figure, passed a
 tube tin carefully adjusted concealed sight. room
 corresponding one placed person to
 answer, mouth tube, voice, an
 ear-trumpet, passed downwards, upwards, the
 words coming clearly distinctly; impossible, thus, detect
 trick. nephew don antonio’s, smart sharp-witted student, was
 answerer, told beforehand uncle the
 persons come day chamber where
 head was, easy matter answer first
 question correctly; others answered guess-work,
 and, clever, cleverly. cide hamete adds marvellous
 contrivance stood ten twelve days; that, became
 noised abroad city house enchanted
 head answered asked questions it, don antonio, fearing
 might come ears watchful sentinels faith,
 explained matter inquisitors, commanded break it
 done it, lest ignorant vulgar be
 scandalised. don quixote, however, sancho head still
 held enchanted one, capable answering questions, though
 don quixote’s satisfaction sancho’s.
 
gentlemen city, gratify don antonio also the
 honours don quixote, give opportunity displaying his
 folly, made arrangements tilting ring six days from
 time, which, however, reason will mentioned hereafter,
 take place.
 
don quixote took fancy stroll city quietly foot,
 feared went horseback boys follow him;
 sancho two servants don antonio gave set for
 walk. thus came pass going along one streets don
 quixote lifted eyes saw written large letters a
 door, “books printed here,” vastly pleased, until
 never seen printing office, curious know
 like. entered following, saw them
 drawing sheets one place, correcting another, setting type
 here, revising there; short work seen great
 printing offices. went one case asked about
 there; workmen told him, watched wonder, passed
 on. approached one man, among others, asked was
 doing. workman replied, “señor, gentleman here” (pointing a
 man prepossessing appearance certain gravity look) “has
 translated italian book spanish tongue, setting it
 type press.”
 
“what title book?” asked don quixote; author
 replied, “señor, italian book called _le bagatelle_.”
 
“and _le bagatelle_ import spanish?” asked don
 quixote.
 
“_le bagatelle_,” said author, “is though say in
 spanish _los juguetes;_ though book humble name has
 good solid matter it.”
 
“i,” said don quixote, “have little smattering italian, i
 plume singing ariosto’s stanzas; tell me, señor—i
 say test ability, merely curiosity—have
 ever met word _pignatta_ book?”
 
“yes, often,” said author.
 
“and render spanish?”
 
“how render it,” returned author, “but _olla_?”
 
“body o’ me,” exclaimed don quixote, “what proficient the
 italian language! lay good wager say in
 italian _piace_ say spanish _place_, say _piu_
 say _mas_, translate _sù_ _arriba_ _giù_ by
 _abajo_.”
 
“i translate course,” said author, “for their
 proper equivalents.”
 
“i venture swear,” said don quixote, “that worship not
 known world, always begrudges reward rare wits
 praiseworthy labours. talents lie wasted there! genius
 thrust away corners! worth left neglected! still seems to
 translation one language another, from
 queens languages, greek latin, like looking at
 flemish tapestries wrong side; though figures are

 show smoothness brightness right side; and
 translation easy languages argues neither ingenuity command of

 allowed work translating, man may employ

 book risk, sold copyright some
 bookseller?”
 
“i print risk,” said author, “and expect make a
 thousand ducats least first edition, two
 thousand copies will go twinkling six reals apiece.”
 
“a fine calculation making!” said don quixote; “it plain you
 don’t know ins outs printers, play one
 another’s hands. promise find saddled two
 thousand copies will feel sore will astonish you,
 particularly book little common any
 way highly spiced.”
 
“what!” said author, “would worship, then, give to
 bookseller will give three maravedis copyright think
 favour? print books win fame the
 world, known already works; want make money,
 without reputation worth rap.”
 
“god send worship good luck,” said don quixote; moved to
 another case, saw correcting sheet book the
 title “light soul;” noticing observed, “books like
 this, though many kind, ones deserve to

 unnumbered needed darkness.”
 
passed on, saw also correcting another book, when
 asked title told called, “the second part the
 ingenious gentleman don quixote mancha,” one tordesillas.
 
“i heard book already,” said don quixote, “and verily and

 walked printing office certain amount displeasure

profound don quixote’s reflections reply enchanted
 head, one them, however, hitting secret trick, but
 concentrated promise, regarded certainty, of
 dulcinea’s disenchantment. turned mind and
 great satisfaction, fully persuaded shortly
 see fulfillment; sancho, though, said, he
 hated governor, still longing giving orders and
 finding obeyed more; misfortune in
 authority, even jest, brings it.
 
resume; afternoon host don antonio moreno two
 friends, don quixote sancho, went galleys. the
 commandant already made aware good fortune seeing
 two famous persons don quixote sancho, instant they
 came shore galleys struck awnings clarions
 rang out. skiff covered rich carpets cushions crimson
 velvet immediately lowered water, don quixote
 stepped board it, leading galley fired gangway gun, and
 galleys same; mounted starboard ladder
 whole crew saluted (as custom personage of
 distinction comes board galley) exclaiming “hu, hu, hu,” three
 times. general, shall call him, valencian gentleman of
 rank, gave hand embraced him, saying, “i shall mark this
 day white stone one happiest can expect enjoy in
 lifetime, since seen señor don quixote mancha, pattern
 image wherein see contained condensed worthy in
 knight-errantry.”
 
don quixote delighted beyond measure lordly reception,
 replied words less courteous. proceeded the
 poop, handsomely decorated, seated the
 bulwark benches; boatswain passed along gangway piped all
 hands strip, instant. sancho, seeing a
 number men stripped skin, taken aback, still more
 saw spread awning briskly seemed as
 devils work it; cakes fancy
 bread going tell now. sancho seated the
 captain’s stage, close aftermost rower right-hand side.
 he, previously instructed do, laid hold sancho,
 hoisting arms, whole crew, standing
 ready, beginning right, proceeded pass on, whirling him
 along hand hand bench bench rapidity that
 took sight poor sancho’s eyes, made quite sure
 devils flying away him; they
 leave sent back along left side and
 deposited poop; poor fellow left bruised and
 breathless sweat, unable comprehend was
 happened him.
 
don quixote saw sancho’s flight without wings asked general
 usual ceremony came board galleys
 first time; for, so, intention adopting them
 profession, mind perform feats agility, and
 anyone offered lay hold whirl about, vowed to
 god kick soul out; said stood and
 clapped hand upon sword. instant struck awning
 lowered yard prodigious rattle. sancho thought heaven
 coming hinges going fall head, full of
 terror ducked buried knees; don
 quixote’s knees altogether control, shook little,
 squeezed shoulders together lost colour. crew hoisted
 yard rapidity clatter lowered it,
 keeping silence though neither voice nor
 breath. boatswain gave signal weigh anchor, leaping upon
 middle gangway began lay shoulders crew
 courbash whip, haul gradually sea.
 
sancho saw many red feet (for took oars be)
 moving together, said himself, “it’s real
 chanted things, ones master talks of. can those
 wretches done whipped; one man goes
 along whistling dare whip many? declare hell, or
 least purgatory!”
 
don quixote, observing attentively sancho regarded going
 on, said him, “ah, sancho friend, quickly cheaply might
 finish disenchantment dulcinea, strip to
 waist take place among gentlemen! amid pain and
 sufferings many feel much; moreover
 perhaps sage merlin allow lashes, laid on
 good hand, count ten must give
 last.”
 
general ask lashes were, was
 dulcinea’s disenchantment, sailor exclaimed, “monjui signals
 oared vessel coast west.”
 
hearing general sprang upon gangway crying, “now then,
 sons, don’t let give us slip! must algerine
 corsair brigantine watchtower signals us.” three others
 immediately came alongside chief galley receive orders.
 general ordered two put kept

 crews plied oars driving galleys furiously seemed
 fly. two put sea, couple miles
 sighted vessel which, far make out, judged to
 one fourteen fifteen banks, proved. soon the
 vessel discovered galleys went object the
 hope making escape speed; attempt failed, the
 chief galley one fastest vessels afloat, overhauled her
 rapidly board brigantine saw clearly no
 possibility escaping, rais therefore them
 drop oars give provoke captain
 command galleys anger. chance, directing things
 otherwise, ordered just chief galley came close
 enough board vessel hear shouts her
 calling surrender, two toraquis, say two turks,
 drunken, dozen board brigantine,
 discharged muskets, killing two soldiers lined the
 sides vessel. seeing general swore leave
 one found board vessel alive, bore down
 furiously upon slipped away underneath oars. the
 galley shot good way ahead; board vessel saw case
 desperate, galley coming made sail,
 sailing rowing tried sheer off; their
 activity much good rashness harm,
 galley coming little half mile
 threw oars took whole alive. other
 two galleys now joined company four returned prize to
 beach, vast multitude stood waiting them, eager see
 brought back. general anchored close in, perceived
 viceroy city shore. ordered skiff to
 push fetch him, yard lowered purpose of
 hanging forthwith rais rest men taken board the
 vessel, six-and-thirty number, smart fellows of
 turkish musketeers. asked rais brigantine,
 answered spanish one prisoners (who afterwards
 proved spanish renegade), “this young man, señor, see
 rais,” pointed one handsomest most
 gallant-looking youths imagined. seem be
 twenty years age.
 
“tell me, dog,” said general, “what led thee kill soldiers,
 thou sawest impossible thee escape? way
 behave chief galleys? knowest thou rashness not
 valour? faint prospects success make men bold, rash.”
 
rais reply, general moment
 listen him, hasten receive viceroy, now
 coming board galley, certain attendants and
 people.
 
“you good chase, señor general,” said viceroy.
 
“your excellency shall soon see good, game strung this
 yard,” replied general.
 
“how so?” returned viceroy.
 
“because,” said general, “against law, reason, usages of
 war killed hands two best soldiers board
 galleys, sworn hang every man taken,
 youth rais brigantine,” he
 pointed stood hands already bound rope
 round neck, ready death.
 
viceroy looked him, seeing well-favoured, so
 graceful, submissive, felt desire spare life, the
 comeliness youth furnishing letter of
 recommendation. therefore questioned him, saying, “tell me, rais,
 art thou turk, moor, renegade?”
 
youth replied, also spanish, “i neither turk, nor
 moor, renegade.”
 
“what art thou, then?” said viceroy.
 
“a christian woman,” replied youth.
 
“a woman christian, dress circumstances! it
 marvellous credible,” said viceroy.
 
“suspend execution sentence,” said youth; “your
 vengeance will lose much waiting tell story of
 life.”
 
heart hard softened words, at
 rate far listen unhappy youth say? the
 general bade say pleased, expect pardon his
 flagrant offence. permission youth began words.

wife don antonio moreno, history says, extremely
 happy see ana felix house. welcomed great
 kindness, charmed well beauty intelligence; in
 respects fair morisco richly endowed, people
 city flocked see though summoned the
 ringing bells.
 
don quixote told don antonio plan adopted releasing don
 gregorio good one, risks greater its
 advantages, better land arms
 horse barbary; carry spite whole
 moorish host, don gaiferos carried wife melisendra.
 
“remember, worship,” observed sancho hearing say so, “señor
 don gaiferos carried wife mainland, took to
 france land; case, chance carry don
 gregorio, way bringing spain, there’s sea
 between.”
 
“there’s remedy everything except death,” said don quixote; “if
 bring vessel close shore shall able get on
 board though world strive prevent us.”
 
“your worship hits mighty well mighty easy,” said sancho;
 “but ‘it’s long step saying doing;’ hold the
 renegade, seems honest good-hearted fellow.”
 
don antonio said renegade prove successful,
 expedient great don quixote’s expedition barbary should
 adopted. two days afterwards renegade put light
 vessel six oars a-side manned stout crew, two days later
 galleys made sail eastward, general begged viceroy
 let know release don gregorio ana
 felix, viceroy promised requested.
 
one morning don quixote went stroll along beach,
 arrayed full armour (for, often said, “his gear,
 rest fray,” never without moment), he
 saw coming towards knight, also full armour, shining
 moon painted shield, who, approaching sufficiently near be
 heard, said loud voice, addressing don quixote,
 “illustrious knight, never sufficiently extolled don quixote la
 mancha, knight white moon, whose unheard-of
 achievements will perhaps recalled thy memory. come do
 battle thee prove might thy arm, end make
 thee acknowledge confess lady, let may, is
 incomparably fairer thy dulcinea toboso. thou dost
 acknowledge fairly openly, thou shalt escape death save me
 trouble inflicting upon thee; thou fightest vanquish
 thee, demand satisfaction that, laying aside arms and
 abstaining going quest adventures, thou withdraw betake
 thyself thine village space year, live there
 without putting hand sword, peace quiet beneficial
 repose, needful increase thy substance and
 salvation thy soul; thou dost vanquish me, head shall
 thy disposal, arms horse thy spoils, renown my
 deeds transferred added thine. consider will thy best
 course, give thy answer speedily, day time i
 despatch business.”
 
don quixote amazed astonished, well knight the
 white moon’s arrogance, reason delivering defiance,
 calm dignity answered him, “knight white moon, of
 whose achievements never heard now, will venture to
 swear never seen illustrious dulcinea; seen
 know taken care venture upon this
 issue, sight removed doubt mind
 ever can beauty compared hers;
 so, saying lie, merely correct what
 state, accept challenge, conditions have
 proposed, once, day fixed may expire; and
 conditions except renown your
 achievements transferred me, know sort they
 may amount to; satisfied own, as
 be. take, therefore, side field choose, will
 same; god shall give may saint peter add his
 blessing.”
 
knight white moon seen city, was
 told viceroy conversation don quixote. the
 viceroy, fancying must fresh adventure got don antonio
 moreno gentleman city, hurried the
 beach accompanied don antonio several gentlemen, just as
 don quixote wheeling rocinante round order take the
 necessary distance. viceroy upon this, seeing pair them
 evidently preparing come charge, put between
 them, asking led engage combat of
 sudden way. knight white moon replied was
 question precedence beauty; briefly told had
 said don quixote, conditions defiance agreed upon
 sides accepted. viceroy went don antonio,
 asked low voice know knight white moon
 was, joke playing don quixote. don antonio
 replied neither knew whether defiance in
 joke earnest. answer left viceroy state of
 perplexity, knowing whether let combat go or
 not; unable persuade anything joke he
 fell back, saying, “if way it, gallant
 knights, except confess die, don quixote inflexible, and
 worship white moon still so, god’s hand it, and
 fall on.”
 
white moon thanked viceroy courteous well-chosen
 words permission gave them, don quixote, who
 then, commending heart heaven his
 dulcinea, custom eve combat awaited him,
 proceeded take little distance, saw antagonist was
 same; then, without blast trumpet warlike
 instrument give signal charge, instant
 wheeled horses; white moon, swifter, met
 don quixote traversed two-thirds course, there
 encountered violence that, without touching his
 lance (for held high, appearance purposely), hurled don
 quixote rocinante earth, perilous fall. sprang upon him
 once, placing lance visor said him, “you are
 vanquished, sir knight, nay dead unless admit conditions our
 defiance.”
 
don quixote, bruised stupefied, without raising visor said a
 weak feeble voice speaking tomb, “dulcinea del
 toboso fairest woman world, unfortunate
 knight earth; fitting truth suffer my
 feebleness; drive lance home, sir knight, take life, since
 taken away honour.”
 
“that will not, sooth,” said white moon; “live fame
 lady dulcinea’s beauty undimmed ever; require that
 great don quixote retire home year, long
 time shall enjoined upon him, agreed before
 engaging combat.”
 
viceroy, don antonio, several others present heard all
 this, heard don quixote replied long nothing in
 prejudice dulcinea demanded him, observe the
 rest like true loyal knight. engagement given, the
 white moon wheeled about, making obeisance viceroy a
 movement head, rode away city half gallop. the
 viceroy bade don antonio hasten him, means other

 found pale bathed sweat.

 hurting him, making condition combat vanquished

 (for regarded vanquished already) return to

“o señor,” said don antonio, “may god forgive wrong have

 quixote’s sanity can never equal enjoyment crazes give? my
 belief señor bachelor’s pains will avail to

bachelor replied events affair promised well, and
 hoped happy result it; putting services don

don antonio reported viceroy carrasco told him, the
 viceroy well pleased hear it, don quixote’s

six days don quixote keep bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and
 sorts, brooding unhappy event defeat. sancho
 strove comfort him, among things said him, “hold up

“peace, sancho,” said don quixote; “thou seest suspension and
 retirement exceed year; shall soon return honoured
 calling, shall loss kingdom win county
 bestow thee.”
 
“may god hear deaf,” said sancho; “i always heard
 say ‘a good hope better bad holding.”
 
talking don antonio came looking extremely pleased and
 exclaiming, “reward good news, señor don quixote! don

don quixote cheered little said, “of truth almost ready

“no that, señor,” said sancho; “‘let hen live, even though

“thou art great philosopher, sancho,” said don quixote; “thou

“señor,” returned sancho, “travelling foot pleasant

 let us leave armour hung tree, instead someone that

“that’s thing,” said sancho; “and should
 feel want rocinante road, well leave

“and yet, rather either armour hung up,” said
 don quixote, “that may said, ‘for good service bad

 upon don quixote’s approach peasant called out, “one two
 gentlemen come here, don’t know parties, will tell us

“that will, certainly,” said don quixote, “and according the
 rights case, can manage understand it.”
 
“well, is, worthy sir,” said peasant; “a man this
 village fat weighs twenty stone challenged another, a
 neighbour his, weigh nine, run race. the
 agreement run distance hundred paces with
 equal weights; challenger asked weights were
 equalised said other, weighed nine stone,
 put eleven iron back, way twenty

“not all,” exclaimed sancho once, don quixote could
 answer; “it’s me, days ago left a
 governor judge, world knows, settle doubtful
 questions give opinion disputes sorts.”
 
“answer god’s name, sancho friend,” said don quixote, “for am

 “brothers, fat man requires reason, a

“by that’s good,” said one peasants heard sancho’s
 decision, “but gentleman spoken like saint, given

“the best plan will run,” said another, “so that
 neither thin man break weight, fat one strip

“i tosilos, lord duke’s lacquey, señor don quixote,” replied

“god bless me!” exclaimed don quixote; “is possible the

 high praise generous disposition lacquey tosilos.
 
“is possible, sancho,” said don quixote, “that thou dost still think
 yonder real lacquey? apparently escaped thy memory
 thou hast seen dulcinea turned transformed peasant
 wench, knight mirrors bachelor carrasco; all
 work enchanters persecute me. tell now, didst

“the thoughts had,” said sancho, “were leave time
 asking fool’s questions. body o’ me, señor! worship a
 condition now inquire people’s thoughts, love
 thoughts?”
 
“look ye, sancho,” said don quixote, “there great difference
 done love done gratitude. a
 knight may possibly proof love; impossible,
 strictly speaking, ungrateful. altisidora, all
 appearance, loved truly; gave three kerchiefs thou
 knowest of; wept departure, cursed me, abused me,
 casting shame winds bewailed public; signs
 adored me; wrath lovers always ends curses. i

 place memory keep her, without prejudice, however, that
 hold devoted dulcinea, thou art wronging thy
 remissness whipping thyself scourging flesh—would i

 relief poor lady.”
 
“señor,” replied sancho, “if truth told, persuade
 whipping backside anything the
 disenchantment enchanted; like saying, ‘if head aches
 rub ointment knees;’ rate i’ll make bold swear that
 histories dealing knight-errantry worship has
 read never come across anybody disenchanted whipping; but
 whether i’ll whip fancy it, the
 opportunity serves scourging comfortably.”
 
“god grant it,” said don quixote; “and heaven give thee grace take
 heart obligation thou art help lady, who
 thine also, inasmuch thou art mine.”
 
pursued journey talking way came very
 spot trampled bulls. don quixote
 recognised it, said sancho, “this meadow came
 upon gay shepherdesses gallant shepherds trying to
 revive imitate pastoral arcadia there, idea novel it
 happy, emulation whereof, thou dost approve it,
 sancho, turn shepherds, rate time
 live retirement. will buy ewes everything else
 requisite pastoral calling; and, name the
 shepherd quixotize thou shepherd panzino, will roam the
 woods groves meadows singing songs here, lamenting elegies
 there, drinking crystal waters springs limpid brooks
 flowing rivers. oaks will yield us sweet fruit with
 bountiful hand, trunks hard cork trees seat, willows
 shade, roses perfume, widespread meadows carpets tinted a
 thousand dyes; clear pure air will give us breath, moon and
 stars lighten darkness night us, song shall our
 delight, lamenting joy, apollo will supply us verses, love
 conceits whereby shall make famed ever, only
 ages come.”
 
“egad,” said sancho, “but sort life squares, nay corners, with
 notions; bachelor samson carrasco master
 nicholas barber won’t well seen they’ll want to
 follow turn shepherds along us; god grant may not
 come curate’s head join sheepfold too, he’s jovial
 fond enjoying himself.”
 
“thou art right it, sancho,” said don quixote; “and the
 bachelor samson carrasco, enters pastoral fraternity, no
 doubt will, may call shepherd samsonino, perhaps the
 shepherd carrascon; nicholas barber may call niculoso, as
 old boscan formerly called nemoroso; curate don’t know
 name can fit unless something derived his
 title, call shepherd curiambro. shepherdesses
 whose lovers shall be, can pick names pears; as
 lady’s name just well shepherdess’s a
 princess’s, need trouble look one will suit
 better; thine, sancho, thou canst give name thou wilt.”
 
“i don’t mean give teresona,” said sancho, “which will
 go well stoutness right name, is
 called teresa; sing praises verses i’ll show
 chaste passion is, i’m going look ‘for better bread
 ever came wheat’ men’s houses. won’t the
 curate shepherdess, sake good example; the
 bachelor chooses one, look-out.”
 
“god bless me, sancho friend!” said don quixote, “what life we
 shall lead! hautboys zamora bagpipes shall hear, what
 tabors, timbrels, rebecks! among different
 sorts music albogues heard, almost pastoral
 instruments will there.”
 
“what albogues?” asked sancho, “for never life heard tell
 saw them.”
 
“albogues,” said don quixote, “are brass plates like candlesticks that
 struck one another hollow side make noise which, if
 pleasing harmonious, disagreeable accords very
 well rude notes bagpipe tabor. word albogue is
 morisco, spanish tongue begin _al;_
 example, _almohaza, almorzar, alhombra, alguacil, alhucema,
 almacen, alcancia_, others sort, not
 many more; language three morisco end _i_,
 _borceguí, zaquizamí_, _maravedí. alhelí_ _alfaquí_
 seen arabic, well _al_ beginning the
 _í_ end with. mention incidentally, chance allusion to
 albogues reminded it; will great assistance
 us perfect practice calling something a
 poet, thou knowest, besides bachelor samson carrasco is
 accomplished one. curate say nothing; will wager he
 spice poet him, doubt master nicholas too,
 barbers, them, guitar players stringers of
 verses. will bewail separation; thou shalt glorify thyself a
 constant lover; shepherd carrascon will figure rejected one,
 curate curiambro whatever may please best; all
 will go gaily heart wish.”
 
sancho made answer, “i unlucky, señor, i’m afraid
 day will never come i’ll see calling. what
 neat spoons i’ll make i’m shepherd! messes, creams,
 garlands, pastoral odds ends! don’t get name for
 wisdom, they’ll fail get one ingenuity. daughter
 sanchica will bring us dinner pasture. stay—she’s
 good-looking, shepherds mischief than
 simplicity them; ‘come wool go back
 shorn;’ love-making lawless desires just common the
 fields cities, shepherds’ shanties royal
 palaces; ‘do away cause, away sin;’ ‘if eyes
 don’t see hearts don’t break’ ‘better clear escape good
 men’s prayers.’”
 
“a truce thy proverbs, sancho,” exclaimed don quixote; “any one of
 thou hast uttered suffice explain thy meaning; many a
 time recommended thee lavish proverbs to
 exercise moderation delivering them; seems is
 ‘preaching desert;’ ‘my mother beats go my
 tricks.”
 
“it seems me,” said sancho, “that worship like common
 saying, ‘said frying-pan kettle, get away, blackbreech.’ you
 chide uttering proverbs, string couples
 yourself.”
 
“observe, sancho,” replied don quixote, “i bring proverbs the
 purpose, quote fit like ring finger; thou
 bringest head shoulders, way thou
 dost drag in, rather introduce them; mistaken, i
 told thee already proverbs short maxims drawn the
 experience observation wise men old; proverb that
 purpose piece nonsense maxim. but
 enough this; nightfall drawing let us retire little
 distance high road pass night; store us
 to-morrow god knoweth.”
 
turned aside, supped late poorly, much against
 sancho’s will, turned mind hardships attendant upon
 knight-errantry woods forests, even though times plenty
 presented castles houses, don diego miranda’s,
 wedding camacho rich, don antonio moreno’s; he
 reflected, however, always day, always night;
 night passed sleeping, master waking.

 diana goes stroll antipodes, leaves mountains all
 black valleys darkness. don quixote obeyed nature far as
 sleep first sleep, give way second, very
 different sancho, never second, sleep
 lasted night till morning, wherein showed sound
 constitution cares had. don quixote’s cares kept him
 restless, much awoke sancho said him, “i am
 amazed, sancho, unconcern thy temperament. believe thou art

 request, desire come grips thee second

 will pass rest night, singing separation, thou

“señor,” replied sancho, “i’m monk get middle my
 sleep scourge myself, seem one can pass from
 one extreme pain whipping music. will your
 worship let sleep, worry whipping myself? you’ll
 make swear never touch hair doublet, say my
 flesh.”
 
“o hard heart!” said don quixote, “o pitiless squire! bread
 ill-bestowed favours ill-acknowledged, done thee
 mean thee! hast thou seen thyself a
 governor, thou seest thyself immediate expectation of
 count, obtaining equivalent title, i—_post
 tenebras spero lucem_.”
 
“i don’t know is,” said sancho; “all know long
 asleep neither fear hope, trouble glory; and
 good luck betide invented sleep, cloak covers over
 man’s thoughts, food removes hunger, drink that
 drives away thirst, fire warms cold, cold tempers
 heat, and, wind with, universal coin wherewith everything
 bought, weight balance makes shepherd equal with
 king fool wise man. sleep, heard say, has
 one fault, like death; sleeping man a
 dead man little difference.”
 
“never heard thee speak elegantly now, sancho,” said don
 quixote; “and begin see truth proverb thou dost
 sometimes quote, ‘not thou art bred, thou art
 fed.’”
 
“ha, life, master mine,” said sancho, “it’s am
 stringing proverbs now, drop pairs worship’s
 mouth faster mine; difference mine
 yours, well-timed mine untimely; anyhow,
 proverbs.”
 
point became aware harsh indistinct noise seemed
 spread valleys around. don quixote stood laid
 hand upon sword, sancho ensconced dapple and
 put bundle armour one side ass’s pack-saddle
 other, fear trembling great don quixote’s
 perturbation. instant noise increased came nearer the
 two terrified men, least one, other, courage
 known all. fact matter men taking
 six hundred pigs sell fair, way with
 hour, great noise made their
 grunting blowing, deafened ears don quixote and
 sancho panza, make was. wide-spread
 grunting drove came surging mass, without showing any
 respect don quixote’s dignity sancho’s, passed right the
 pair them, demolishing sancho’s entrenchments, only
 upsetting don quixote sweeping rocinante feet the
 bargain; trampling grunting, pace at
 unclean beasts went, pack-saddle, armour, dapple and
 rocinante left scattered ground sancho don quixote
 wits’ end.
 
sancho got well begged master give his
 sword, saying wanted kill half dozen dirty unmannerly
 pigs, time found were.
 
“let be, friend,” said don quixote; “this insult penalty
 sin; righteous chastisement heaven jackals
 devour vanquished knight, wasps sting pigs trample
 foot.”
 
“i suppose chastisement heaven, too,” said sancho, “that
 flies prick squires vanquished knights, lice eat

“sleep thou, sancho,” returned don quixote, “for thou wast born to

 little madrigal which, unknown thee, composed head last
 night.”
 
“i think,” said sancho, “that thoughts allow one to

 verses much like i’ll sleep much can;” and
 forthwith, taking space ground required, muffled himself
 fell sound sleep, undisturbed bond, debt, trouble

accompanied verse many sighs tears, just
 like one whose heart pierced grief defeat his

now daylight came, sun smote sancho eyes his
 beams. awoke, roused up, shook stretched his
 lazy limbs, seeing havoc pigs made stores he
 cursed drove, besides. pair resumed their
 journey, evening closed saw coming towards ten
 men horseback four five foot. don quixote’s heart beat

 carried lances bucklers, warlike guise. don
 quixote turned sancho said, “if make use weapons,

 sancho fared way, moment seemed speak one

 fears two prisoners grew greater, especially heard
 assailed with—“get on, ye troglodytes;” “silence, ye
 barbarians;” “march, ye cannibals;” “no murmuring, ye scythians;”
 “don’t open eyes, ye murderous polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty

horsemen dismounted, and, together men foot, without a
 moment’s delay taking sancho don quixote bodily, carried
 court, round near hundred torches fixed in
 sockets burning, besides five hundred lamps the
 corridors, spite night, somewhat dark, the
 want daylight perceived. middle court was
 catafalque, raised two yards ground covered
 completely immense canopy black velvet, steps all
 round white wax tapers burned hundred silver
 candlesticks. upon catafalque seen dead body damsel so
 lovely beauty made death look beautiful. lay
 head resting upon cushion brocade crowned a
 garland sweet-smelling flowers divers sorts, hands crossed
 upon bosom, branch yellow palm victory. on
 one side court erected stage, upon two chairs were
 seated two persons crowns heads sceptres
 hands appeared kings sort, whether real mock
 ones. side stage, reached steps, two
 chairs men carrying prisoners seated don quixote
 sancho, silence, signs giving understand that
 silent; which, however, been
 without signs, amazement saw held them
 tongue-tied. now two persons distinction, once
 recognised don quixote hosts duke duchess, ascended
 stage attended numerous suite, seated two
 gorgeous chairs close two kings, seemed be. would
 amazed this? all, don quixote had
 perceived dead body catafalque fair
 altisidora. duke duchess mounted stage don quixote and
 sancho rose made profound obeisance, returned by
 bowing heads slightly. moment official crossed over,
 approaching sancho threw robe black buckram painted
 flames fire, taking cap put upon head

 whispered ear must open lips, would
 put gag upon him, take life. sancho surveyed head
 foot saw ablaze flames; not
 burn him, care two farthings them. took mitre
 seeing painted devils put again, saying to
 himself, “well, far don’t burn carry off.”
 don quixote surveyed too, though fear got better his
 faculties, help smiling see figure sancho
 presented. now underneath catafalque, seemed, there
 rose low sweet sound flutes, which, coming unbroken human voice
 (for silence kept silence), soft languishing
 effect. then, beside pillow seemed dead body,
 suddenly appeared fair youth roman habit, who, the
 accompaniment harp played, sang sweet and
 clear voice two stanzas:
 
fair altisidora, sport

point one two looked like kings exclaimed, “enough,

 death charms peerless altisidora, dead the
 ignorant world imagines, living voice fame the

 long-lost light. thou, therefore, rhadamanthus, sittest
 judgment murky caverns dis, thou knowest all
 inscrutable fates decreed touching resuscitation of
 damsel, announce declare once, happiness we
 look forward restoration longer deferred.”
 
sooner minos fellow judge rhadamanthus said this, than
 rhadamanthus rising said:
 
“ho, officials house, high low, great small, make haste
 hither one all, print sancho’s face four-and-twenty smacks,
 give twelve pinches six pin thrusts back arms;
 upon ceremony depends restoration altisidora.”
 
hearing sancho broke silence cried out, “by that’s

“thou shalt die,” said rhadamanthus loud voice; “relent, thou

 say, officials, obey orders; word honest man, ye
 shall see ye born for.”
 
six duennas, advancing across court, made their
 appearance procession, one other, four with
 spectacles, right hands uplifted, showing four
 fingers wrist make hands look longer, fashion
 now-a-days. sooner sancho caught sight than, bellowing
 like bull, exclaimed, “i might let handled the
 world; allow duennas touch me—not bit it! scratch face,
 master served castle; run body
 burnished daggers; pinch arms red-hot pincers; i’ll bear
 patience serve gentlefolk; won’t let duennas
 touch me, though devil carry off!”
 
don quixote, too, broke silence, saying sancho, “have patience,
 son, gratify noble persons, give thanks heaven
 infused virtue thy person, sufferings
 thou canst disenchant enchanted restore life dead.”
 
duennas now close sancho, he, become more
 tractable reasonable, settling well chair presented
 face beard first, delivered smack stoutly
 laid on, made low curtsey.
 
“less politeness less paint, señora duenna,” said sancho; “by god
 hands smell vinegar-wash.”
 
line, duennas smacked several others the
 household pinched him; stand pricked by
 pins; so, apparently patience, started his
 chair, seizing lighted torch stood near fell upon the
 duennas whole set tormentors, exclaiming, “begone, ye
 ministers hell; i’m made brass feel such
 out-of-the-way tortures.”
 
instant altisidora, probably tired so
 long lying back, turned side; seeing bystanders
 cried almost one voice, “altisidora alive! altisidora
 lives!”
 
rhadamanthus bade sancho put away wrath, object in
 view now attained. don quixote saw altisidora move, went on
 knees sancho saying him, “now time, bowels,
 call thee squire, thee give thyself those
 lashes thou art bound lay disenchantment dulcinea.
 now, say, time virtue thee ripe, and
 endowed efficacy work good looked thee.”
 
sancho made answer, “that’s trick upon trick, think, not
 honey upon pancakes; nice thing whipping come
 now, top pinches, smacks, pin-proddings! better
 take big stone tie round neck, pitch well; i
 mind much, i’m always made cow the
 wedding cure people’s ailments. leave alone; or
 else god i’ll fling whole thing dogs, let come may.”
 
altisidora time sat catafalque, so
 clarions sounded, accompanied flutes, voices all
 present exclaiming, “long life altisidora! long life altisidora!”
 duke duchess kings minos rhadamanthus stood up, and
 all, together don quixote sancho, advanced receive and
 take catafalque; she, making though were
 recovering swoon, bowed head duke duchess to
 kings, looking sideways don quixote, said him, “god
 forgive thee, insensible knight, thy cruelty been,
 seems, thousand years world; to
 thee, compassionate upon earth, render thanks life i
 now possession of. day forth, friend sancho, count as
 thine six smocks mine bestow upon thee, make many
 shirts thyself, quite whole, rate
 clean.”
 
sancho kissed hands gratitude, kneeling, mitre in
 hand. duke bade take him, give back his
 cap doublet remove flaming robe. sancho begged duke to
 let leave robe mitre; wanted take home
 token memento unexampled adventure. duchess said
 must leave him; knew already great friend
 was. duke gave orders court be
 cleared, retire chambers, don

“she might died welcome,” said sancho, “when pleased and

 said before, anything sufferings sancho panza.

“sleep, sancho friend,” said don quixote, “if pinprodding and
 pinches thou hast received smacks administered thee will let

“no pain came insult smacks,” said sancho, “for the
 simple reason duennas, confound them, gave me;

fell asleep, them, cide hamete, author this
 great history, took opportunity record relate was

 practised upon him, device disenchantment of
 dulcinea expense sancho’s backside; finally gave him
 account trick sancho played upon master, making him
 believe dulcinea enchanted turned country wench;
 duchess, wife, persuaded sancho he

 bachelor laughed little, marvelled well the
 sharpness simplicity sancho length don
 quixote’s madness went. duke begged found (whether
 overcame not) return way let know result.
 bachelor did; set quest don quixote, not
 finding saragossa, went on, fared already
 told. returned duke’s castle told all, the
 conditions combat were, don quixote now, like a
 loyal knight-errant, returning keep promise retiring his
 village year, time, said bachelor, might perhaps
 cured madness; object led to
 adopt disguises, sad thing gentleman such
 good parts don quixote madman. took leave of
 duke, went home village wait don quixote,
 coming him. thereupon duke seized opportunity of
 practising mystification upon him; much enjoy everything
 connected sancho don quixote. roads the
 castle far near, everywhere thought don quixote likely to
 pass return, occupied large numbers servants foot
 horseback, bring castle, fair means or
 foul, met him. meet him, sent word duke,
 who, already settled done, soon heard of
 arrival, ordered torches lamps court lit and

 ceremony described, whole affair well
 arranged acted differed little reality. cide
 hamete says, moreover, part considers concocters of

 two fingers’ breadth removed something like fools

latter, one sleeping soundly lying awake
 occupied desultory thoughts, daylight came them
 bringing desire rise; lazy never a
 delight don quixote, victor vanquished. altisidora, come back
 death life don quixote fancied, following freak of
 lord lady, entered chamber, crowned garland she
 worn catafalque robe white taffeta embroidered
 gold flowers, hair flowing loose shoulders, and
 leaning upon staff fine black ebony. don quixote, disconcerted and
 confusion appearance, huddled well-nigh
 covered altogether sheets counterpane bed,
 tongue-tied, unable offer civility. altisidora seated
 chair head bed, and, deep sigh, said
 feeble, soft voice, “when women rank modest maidens
 trample honour foot, give loose tongue breaks
 every impediment, publishing abroad inmost secrets their
 hearts, reduced sore extremities. one i, señor
 don quixote mancha, crushed, conquered, love-smitten, yet
 patient suffering virtuous, much heart
 broke grief lost life. last two days been
 dead, slain thought cruelty thou hast treated
 me, obdurate knight,
 
harder thou marble plaint;
 

least believed dead saw me; been
 love, taking pity me, let recovery rest upon sufferings
 good squire, remained world.”
 
“love might well let rest upon sufferings ass,
 obliged him,” said sancho. “but tell me,
 señora—and may heaven send tenderer lover master—what did
 see world? goes hell? course that’s
 one dies despair bound for.”
 
“to tell truth,” said altisidora, “i died outright,
 go hell; gone in, certain should
 never come again, might. truth is, came the
 gate, dozen devils playing tennis, in
 breeches doublets, falling collars trimmed flemish
 bonelace, ruffles served wristbands, with
 four fingers’ breadth arms exposed make hands look
 longer; hands held rackets fire; amazed me
 still books, apparently full wind rubbish, served
 tennis balls, strange marvellous thing; this, however,
 astonish much observe that, although players
 usual winners glad losers sorry, in
 game growling, snarling, cursing
 one another.” “that’s wonder,” said sancho; “for devils, whether
 playing not, can never content, win lose.”
 
“very likely,” said altisidora; “but another thing that
 surprises too, mean surprised then, ball
 outlasted first throw use second time; was
 wonderful constant succession books, new old. to
 one them, brand-new, well-bound one, gave stroke that
 knocked guts scattered leaves about. ‘look
 book is,’ said one devil another, replied,
 ‘it “second part history don quixote mancha,”
 cide hamete, original author, aragonese his
 account tordesillas.’ ‘out it,’ said first,
 ‘and depths hell sight.’ ‘is bad?’
 said other. ‘so bad it,’ said first, ‘that set
 deliberately make worse, done it.’ they
 went game, knocking books about; i, having
 heard mention name don quixote love adore so,
 took care retain vision memory.”
 
“a vision must been, doubt,” said don quixote, “for is
 world; history going for
 time hand hand, stay long any, for
 everybody gives taste foot. disturbed hearing
 wandering fantastic shape darkness pit or
 daylight above, one history treats of. if
 good, faithful, true, will ages life; but
 bad, birth burial will very
 long journey.”
 
altisidora proceed complaint don quixote,
 said her, “i several times told you, señora, it
 grieves set affections upon me, mine
 can receive gratitude, return. born belong to
 dulcinea toboso, fates, any, dedicated to
 her; suppose beauty can take place she
 occupies heart suppose impossibility. frank
 declaration suffice make retire within bounds your
 modesty, one can bind impossibilities.”
 
hearing this, altisidora, show anger agitation,
 exclaimed, “god’s life! don stockfish, soul mortar, stone a
 date, obstinate obdurate clown asked favour he
 mind made up, fall upon i’ll tear eyes out! do
 fancy, don vanquished, don cudgelled, died sake?
 seen to-night make-believe; i’m the
 woman let black nail suffer camel, much less
 die!”
 
“that can well believe,” said sancho; “for lovers
 pining death absurd; may talk it, doing
 it—judas may believe that!”
 
talking, musician, singer, poet, sung
 two stanzas given came in, making profound obeisance to
 don quixote said, “will worship, sir knight, reckon retain me
 number faithful servants, long a
 great admirer yours, well fame your
 achievements?” “will worship tell are,” replied don
 quixote, “so courtesy may answerable deserts?” the
 young man replied musician songster night
 before. “of truth,” said don quixote, “your worship most
 excellent voice; sang seem much the
 purpose; garcilasso’s stanzas death of
 lady?”
 
“don’t surprised that,” returned musician; “for the
 callow poets day way every one write pleases
 pilfer chooses, whether germane matter or
 not, now-a-days piece silliness can sing or
 write set poetic licence.”
 
don quixote reply, prevented duke and
 duchess, came see him, followed long
 delightful conversation, course sancho said many
 droll saucy things left duke duchess wondering not
 simplicity sharpness. don quixote begged their
 permission take departure day, inasmuch a
 vanquished knight like fitter live a
 pig-sty royal palace. gave readily, the
 duchess asked altisidora good graces.
 
replied, “señora, let tell ladyship damsel’s
 ailment comes entirely idleness, cure honest and
 constant employment. told lace worn hell;
 must know make it, let never hands;
 occupied shifting bobbins fro, image
 images loves will shift fro thoughts;
 truth, opinion, advice.”
 
“and mine,” added sancho; “for never life saw lace-maker
 died love; damsels work minds set
 finishing tasks thinking loves. speak from
 experience; i’m digging never think old woman;
 mean teresa panza, love better eyelids.” “you
 say well, sancho,” said duchess, “and will take care my
 altisidora employs henceforward needlework sort; for
 extremely expert it.” “there occasion recourse
 remedy, señora,” said altisidora; “for mere thought the
 cruelty vagabond villain treated will suffice to
 blot memory without device; your
 highness’s leave will retire, eyes, won’t say
 rueful countenance, abominable, ugly looks.” “that reminds
 common saying, ‘he rails ready forgive,’”
 said duke.
 
altisidora then, pretending wipe away tears handkerchief,
 made obeisance master mistress quitted room.
 
“ill luck betide thee, poor damsel,” said sancho, “ill luck betide
 thee! thou hast fallen soul dry rush heart as
 hard oak; me, i’faith ‘another cock crowed to

conversation came end, don quixote dressed and
 dined duke duchess, set evening.

vanquished afflicted don quixote went along downcast in
 one respect happy another. sadness arose his
 defeat, satisfaction thought virtue lay in
 sancho, proved resurrection altisidora; though it
 difficulty persuade love-smitten
 damsel really dead. sancho went along anything cheerful,
 grieved altisidora kept promise giving
 smocks; turning mind said his
 master, “surely, señor, i’m unlucky doctor world;
 there’s many physician that, killing sick man to
 cure, requires paid work, though signing bit
 list medicines, apothecary makes up, and,
 there, labour over; though cure somebody else
 costs drops blood, smacks, pinches, pinproddings, whippings,
 nobody gives farthing. well, swear that’s good they
 put another patient hands, they’ll grease me
 cure him; for, say, ‘it’s singing abbot
 gets dinner,’ i’m going believe heaven bestowed
 upon virtue have, dealing others
 nothing.”
 
“thou art right, sancho friend,” said don quixote, “and altisidora
 behaved badly giving thee smocks promised; and
 although virtue thine _gratis data_—as cost thee no
 study whatever, study thy personal sufferings may
 be—i can say thou wouldst payment the
 lashes account disenchant dulcinea, given it
 thee freely ere this. sure, however, whether payment will
 comport cure, reward interfere with
 medicine. think will nothing lost trying it; consider
 much thou wouldst have, sancho, whip thyself once, pay
 thyself thine hand, thou hast money mine.”
 
proposal sancho opened eyes ears palm’s breadth
 wide, heart readily acquiesced whipping himself, and
 said master, “very well then, señor, i’ll hold in
 readiness gratify worship’s wishes i’m profit it; for
 love wife children forces seem grasping. let your
 worship say much will pay lash give myself.”
 
“if sancho,” replied don quixote, “i requite thee the
 importance nature cure deserves, treasures venice,
 mines potosi, insufficient pay thee. see thou
 hast mine, put price lash.”
 
“of them,” said sancho, “there three thousand three hundred and
 odd; given five, rest remain; let five
 go odd ones, let us take three thousand three hundred,
 quarter real apiece (for will take less though the
 whole world bid me) make three thousand three hundred quarter
 reals; three thousand one thousand five hundred half reals,
 make seven hundred fifty reals; three hundred make a
 hundred fifty half reals, come seventy-five reals, which
 added seven hundred fifty make eight hundred twenty-five
 reals all. will stop belonging your
 worship, i’ll return home rich content, though well whipped,
 ‘there’s taking trout’—but say more.”
 
“o blessed sancho! dear sancho!” said don quixote; “how shall be
 bound serve thee, dulcinea i, days lives that
 heaven may grant us! returns lost shape (and be
 will) misfortune will good fortune, my
 defeat happy triumph. look here, sancho; wilt thou
 begin scourging? thou wilt make short work it, will
 give thee hundred reals above.”
 
“when?” said sancho; “this night without fail. let worship order
 pass doors open air, i’ll
 scarify myself.”
 
night, longed don quixote greatest anxiety the
 world, came last, though seemed wheels of
 apollo’s car broken down, day drawing out
 longer usual, just case lovers, never make the
 reckoning desires agree time. made way at
 length among pleasant trees stood little distance from
 road, vacating rocinante’s saddle dapple’s
 pack-saddle, stretched green grass made
 supper sancho’s stores, making powerful flexible
 whip dapple’s halter headstall retreated twenty paces
 master among beech trees. don quixote seeing march
 resolution spirit, said him, “take care, my
 friend, cut thyself pieces; allow lashes wait one
 another, great hurry run thyself of
 breath midway; mean, lay strenuously make thy life
 fail thee thou hast reached desired number; thou
 mayest lose card much little, will station myself
 apart count rosary lashes thou givest thyself. may
 heaven help thee thy good intention deserves.”
 
“‘pledges don’t distress good payer,’” said sancho; “i mean lay on
 way without killing hurt myself, that, no
 doubt, lies essence miracle.”
 
stripped waist upwards, snatching the
 rope began lay don quixote count lashes. might
 given six eight began think joke no
 trifle, price low; holding hand moment, he
 told master cried score blind bargain, for
 lashes paid rate half real
 instead quarter.
 
“go on, sancho friend, disheartened,” said don quixote;
 “for double stakes price.”
 
“in case,” said sancho, “in god’s hand it, let rain
 lashes.” rogue longer laid shoulders, laid
 trees, groans every now then, one would
 thought soul plucked the
 roots. don quixote, touched heart, fearing might make an
 end himself, sancho’s imprudence might miss his
 object, said him, “as thou livest, friend, let matter
 rest is, remedy seems rough one, it
 will well patience; ‘zamora won hour.’ i
 reckoned wrong thou hast given thyself thousand lashes;
 enough present; ‘for ass,’ put homely
 phrase, ‘bears load, overload.’”
 
“no, no, señor,” replied sancho; “it shall never said me, ‘the
 money paid, arms broken;’ go back little further, worship,
 let give rate thousand lashes more; a
 couple bouts like shall finished lot, there
 will even cloth spare.”
 
“as thou art willing mood,” said don quixote, “may heaven aid
 thee; lay i’ll retire.”
 
sancho returned task much resolution soon had

“as worship will so, señor,” said sancho, “so it; but

 traveller horseback three four servants, one said to

 worship may take siesta to-day; quarters seem clean cool.”
 
heard don quixote said sancho, “look here, sancho; on
 turning leaves book second part history i
 think came casually upon name don Álvaro tarfe.”
 
“very likely,” said sancho; “we better let dismount, and
 by-and-by can ask it.”
 
gentleman dismounted, landlady gave room the
 ground floor opposite don quixote’s adorned painted serge
 hangings sort. newly arrived gentleman put summer
 coat, coming gateway hostelry, wide and
 cool, addressing don quixote, pacing there, he
 asked, “in direction worship bound, gentle sir?”
 
“to village near village,” replied don quixote;
 “and worship, bound for?”
 
“i going granada, señor,” said gentleman, “to own
 country.”
 
“and goodly country,” said don quixote; “but will worship me
 favour telling name, strikes more
 importance know can tell you.”
 
“my name don Álvaro tarfe,” replied traveller.
 
don quixote returned, “i doubt whatever your
 worship don Álvaro tarfe appears print second
 part history don quixote mancha, lately printed and
 published new author.”
 
“i same,” replied gentleman; “and don quixote, the
 principal personage said history, great friend of
 mine, took away home, least induced him
 come jousts held saragossa, whither was
 going myself; indeed, showed many kindnesses, saved from

 extreme rashness.”
 
“tell me, señor don Álvaro,” said don quixote, “am like that
 don quixote talk of?”
 
“no indeed,” replied traveller, “not bit.”
 
“and don quixote—” said one, “had squire called
 sancho panza?”
 
“he had,” said don Álvaro; “but though name very
 droll, never heard say anything drollery it.”
 
“that can well believe,” said sancho this, “for come with
 drolleries everybody’s line; sancho worship
 speaks of, gentle sir, must great scoundrel, dunderhead, and
 thief, one; real sancho panza, more
 drolleries rained them; let worship try; come
 along year so, will find fall at

 protector widows, killer damsels, sole

 dreams mockeries.”
 
“by god believe it,” said don Álvaro; “for uttered more
 drolleries, friend, words spoken other

 convinced enchanters persecute don quixote good have

“that will willingly,” replied don Álvaro; “though amazes
 find two don quixotes two sancho panzas once, much
 alike name differ demeanour; say declare

“no doubt worship enchanted, like lady dulcinea toboso,”
 said sancho; “and heaven disenchantment rested my
 giving another three thousand odd lashes like i’m
 giving her, i’d lay without looking for
 anything.”
 
“i don’t understand lashes,” said don Álvaro. sancho
 replied long story tell, tell they

dinner-time arrived, don quixote don Álvaro dined
 together. alcalde village came chance inn

 showing requisite rights don Álvaro tarfe, the
 gentleman present, make declaration he

 alcalde finally put legal form, declaration made with
 formalities required cases, don quixote and
 sancho high delight, declaration sort any

 Álvaro don quixote, course great manchegan
 displayed good taste disabused don Álvaro error he

 enchanted, now brought contact two such

evening came, set village, half a
 league two roads branched off, one leading don quixote’s village,
 road don Álvaro follow. short interval don
 quixote told unfortunate defeat, dulcinea’s
 enchantment remedy, threw don Álvaro fresh
 amazement, embracing don quixote sancho, went way, and
 don quixote went his. night passed among trees order
 give sancho opportunity working penance, did
 fashion night before, expense bark of
 beech trees much back, took good
 care lashes knocked fly been

 count, found together night they
 made three thousand twenty-nine. sun apparently got up

 journey, discussing deception practised don Álvaro, saying

 absolutely certain merlin’s promises lie. full of
 thoughts anxieties, ascended rising ground wherefrom

 thy sancho panza comes back thee, rich, well
 whipped! open thine arms receive, too, thy don quixote, who, if
 comes vanquished arm another, comes victor himself,
 which, told me, greatest victory anyone can

don quixote heard this, said sancho, “dost thou mark,
 friend, boy said, ‘thou shalt never see long as
 thou livest’?”
 
“well,” said sancho, “what matter boy said so?”
 
“what!” said don quixote, “dost thou see that, applied the
 object desires, words mean never see dulcinea
 more?”
 
sancho answer, attention diverted seeing a
 hare come flying across plain pursued several greyhounds and
 sportsmen. terror ran take shelter hide under
 dapple. sancho caught alive presented don quixote, was
 saying, “_malum signum, malum signum!_ hare flies, greyhounds chase
 it, dulcinea appears not.”
 
“your worship’s strange man,” said sancho; “let’s take granted
 hare dulcinea, greyhounds chasing the
 malignant enchanters turned country wench; flies,
 catch put worship’s hands, hold her
 arms cherish her; bad sign that, ill omen
 found here?”
 
two boys quarrelling came look hare,
 sancho asked one quarrel about. was
 answered one said, “thou shalt never see as
 long thou livest,” taken cage full crickets from
 boy, mean give back long he
 lived. sancho took four cuartos pocket gave to
 boy cage, placed don quixote’s hands, saying,
 “there, señor! omens broken destroyed, have
 affairs, thinking, fool am, with
 last year’s clouds; remember rightly heard curate
 village say become christians sensible
 people give heed silly things; even yourself
 said time ago, telling christians who
 minded omens fools; there’s need making words it;
 let us push go village.”
 
sportsmen came asked hare, don quixote gave
 them. went on, upon green entrance town
 came upon curate bachelor samson carrasco busy with
 breviaries. mentioned sancho thrown, way
 sumpter-cloth, dapple bundle armour, the
 buckram robe painted flames put upon the
 duke’s castle night altisidora came back life. also fixed
 mitre dapple’s head, oddest transformation decoration
 ever ass world underwent. recognised by
 curate bachelor, came towards open arms.
 don quixote dismounted received close embrace; the
 boys, lynxes nothing escapes, spied ass’s mitre
 came running see it, calling one another, “come here,
 boys, see sancho panza’s ass figged finer mingo, don
 quixote’s beast leaner ever.”
 
length, boys capering round them, accompanied the
 curate bachelor, made entrance town, and
 proceeded don quixote’s house, door found his
 housekeeper niece, news arrival already
 reached. brought teresa panza, sancho’s wife, well,
 hair loose half naked, dragging sanchica her
 daughter hand, ran meet husband; seeing him
 coming means good case thought governor to
 be, said him, “how come way, husband? seems to
 come tramping footsore, looking like disorderly
 vagabond governor.”
 
“hold tongue, teresa,” said sancho; “often ‘where pegs
 flitches;’ let’s go house you’ll hear
 strange things. bring money, that’s main thing, got own
 industry without wronging anybody.”
 
“you bring money, good husband,” said teresa, “and matter
 whether got way that; for, however may got it,
 you’ll brought new practice world.”
 
sanchica embraced father asked brought anything,
 looking showers may; she
 taking hold girdle one side, wife hand,
 daughter led dapple, made house, leaving don
 quixote his, hands niece housekeeper, the
 company curate bachelor.
 
don quixote once, without regard time season, withdrew in
 private bachelor curate, words told them
 defeat, engagement quit his
 village year, meant keep letter without
 departing hair’s breadth it, became knight-errant bound by
 scrupulous good faith laws knight-errantry; he
 thought turning shepherd year, taking diversion in

 calling; besought them, great deal and
 prevented important business, consent his
 companions, buy sheep enough qualify for
 shepherds; important point whole affair, could
 tell them, settled, given names fit them
 t. curate asked were. don quixote replied he
 called shepherd quixotize bachelor the
 shepherd carrascon, curate shepherd curambro, sancho
 panza shepherd pancino.
 
astounded don quixote’s new craze; however, lest should
 make village pursuit his
 chivalry, trusting course year might be
 cured, fell new project, applauded crazy idea a
 bright one, offered share life him. “and what’s more,”
 said samson carrasco, “i am, world knows, famous
 poet, i’ll always making verses, pastoral, courtly, it
 may come head, pass away time secluded regions
 shall roaming. needful, sirs, each
 us choose name shepherdess means glorify in
 verses, leave tree, ever hard,
 without writing carving name it, habit and
 custom love-smitten shepherds.”
 
“that’s thing,” said don quixote; “though relieved from
 looking name imaginary shepherdess, there’s the
 peerless dulcinea toboso, glory brooksides, the
 ornament meadows, mainstay beauty, cream the
 graces, and, word, praise appropriate, be
 ever hyperbolical.”
 
“very true,” said curate; “but others must look for
 accommodating shepherdesses will answer purpose one way or
 another.”
 
“and,” added samson carrasco, “if fail us, can call the
 names ones print world filled with, fílidas,
 amarilises, dianas, fleridas, galateas, belisardas; sell
 market-places may fairly buy make own.

 recommending beseeching take care health treat

 don quixote, said niece, “what’s this, uncle? now were
 thinking come back stay home lead quiet respectable
 life there, going get fresh entanglements, turn
 ‘young shepherd, thou comest here, young shepherd going there?’
 nay! indeed ‘the straw hard now make pipes of.’”
 
“and,” added housekeeper, “will worship able bear, out

 howling wolves? you; that’s life business for
 hardy men, bred seasoned work almost time they

 advice—and i’m giving full bread wine, but
 fasting, fifty years upon head—stay home, look after
 affairs, go often confession, good poor, upon my
 soul evil comes you.”
 
“hold peace, daughters,” said don quixote; “i know well
 duty is; help bed, don’t feel well; rest
 assured that, knight-errant now wandering shepherd be, shall
 never fail care interests, will see the
 end.” good wenches (for undoubtedly were), the
 housekeeper niece, helped bed, gave something

 niece, squire, fell weeping bitterly, him
 lying dead them. doctor’s opinion melancholy and
 depression bringing end. don quixote begged to
 leave himself, wish sleep little. obeyed,
 slept one stretch, saying is, six hours, so
 housekeeper niece thought going sleep ever.
 end time woke up, loud voice exclaimed,
 “blessed almighty god, shown goodness. truth his
 mercies boundless, sins men can neither limit nor

niece listened attention uncle’s words, struck
 coherent usually fell him, least during
 illness, asked, “what saying, señor? anything
 strange occurred? mercies sins men talking of?”
 
“the mercies, niece,” said don quixote, “are god this
 moment shown me, him, said, sins impediment to

three heard speak way, doubt whatever

 “what? señor don quixote! now intelligence lady

 princes, thinking turning hermit? hush, heaven’s sake,

“all nonsense,” said don quixote, “that now a

 extremities like this, man must trifle soul; and
 curate confessing let someone, beg, go the

 though uncertain, inclined believe him, one the
 signs came conclusion dying so
 sudden complete return senses mad; to
 words already quoted added much more, well expressed, so
 devout, rational, banish doubt convince that
 sound mind. curate turned out, left alone

 shortly afterwards sancho, who, already
 learned bachelor condition master in, finding
 housekeeper niece weeping, began blubber shed tears.

“ah!” said sancho weeping, “don’t die, master, take advice and
