“and mademoiselle’s address?” asked.
 
“is briony lodge, serpentine avenue, st. john’s wood.”
 
holmes took note it. “one question,” said he. “was the

“and yet convinced it,” answered. “the cases come

 police reports realism pushed extreme limits, and
 yet result is, must confessed, neither fascinating nor

“a certain selection discretion must used producing a

 magistrate upon details, observer contain the

 peeped nervous, hesitating fashion windows, her
 body oscillated backward forward, fingers fidgeted her

“i seen symptoms before,” said holmes, throwing his
 cigarette fire. “oscillation upon pavement always means an

“do find,” said, “that short sight little

“i first,” answered, “but now know letters are
 without looking.” then, suddenly realising full purport his
 words, gave violent start looked up, fear and
 astonishment upon broad, good-humoured face. “you’ve heard about
 me, mr. holmes,” cried, “else know that?”
 
“never mind,” said holmes, laughing; “it business know things.
 perhaps trained see others overlook. not, why
 come consult me?”
 
“i came you, sir, heard mrs. etherege, whose
 husband found easy police everyone given up
 dead. oh, mr. holmes, wish much me. i’m not
 rich, still hundred year right, besides the

“why come away consult hurry?” asked sherlock
 holmes, finger-tips together eyes ceiling.

 came right away you.”
 
“your father,” said holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since name is
 different.”
 
“yes, stepfather. call father, though sounds funny, too,
 five years two months older myself.”
 
“and mother alive?”
 
“oh, yes, mother alive well. wasn’t best pleased, mr. holmes,
 married soon father’s death, man was
 nearly fifteen years younger herself. father plumber the
 tottenham court road, left tidy business behind him, which
 mother carried mr. hardy, foreman; mr. windibank
 came made sell business, superior, a
 traveller wines. got £ 4700 goodwill interest,
 wasn’t near much father got been
 alive.”
 
expected see sherlock holmes impatient rambling and
 inconsequential narrative, but, contrary, listened with
 greatest concentration attention.
 
“your little income,” asked, “does come business?”
 
“oh, no, sir. quite separate left uncle ned in
 auckland. new zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. two thousand
 five hundred pounds amount, can touch interest.”
 
“you interest extremely,” said holmes. “and since draw large
 sum hundred year, earn bargain, no
 doubt travel little indulge every way. believe that
 single lady can get nicely upon income £ 60.”
 
“i much less that, mr. holmes, understand

“you made position clear me,” said holmes. “this is

 said. “they used send father tickets alive, then

“i suppose,” said holmes, “that mr. windibank came back from

“oh, well, good it. laughed, remember, and
 shrugged shoulders, said use denying anything a

“i see. gasfitters’ ball met, understand, a

“yes, sir. met night, called next day ask we

“no?”
 
“well, know father didn’t like anything sort. wouldn’t

“but mr. hosmer angel? make attempt see you?”
 
“well, father going france week, hosmer wrote

“were engaged gentleman time?”
 
“oh, yes, mr. holmes. engaged first walk we

“what office?”
 
“that’s worst it, mr. holmes, don’t know.”
 
“where live, then?”
 
“he slept premises.”
 
“and don’t know address?”
 
“no—except leadenhall street.”
 
“where address letters, then?”
 
“to leadenhall street post office, left till called for. he
 said sent office chaffed all

“it suggestive,” said holmes. “it long axiom of

“he shy man, mr. holmes. rather walk the

 told me, left weak throat, hesitating,

“well, happened mr. windibank, stepfather, returned

“mr. hosmer angel came house proposed should

 holmes.
 
“oh, no, sir! good kind leave so. why, the

“most certainly does. opinion is, then, some

“but notion been?”

“it nice complimentary you,” holmes answered. “it is

lestrade looked startled. “i quite follow,” said.
 
“how glass? twenty-nine, see. wind, cloud the

lestrade laughed indulgently. “you have, doubt, already formed your

hardly spoken rushed room one most
 lovely young women ever seen life. violet eyes
 shining, lips parted, pink flush upon cheeks, thought of
 natural reserve lost overpowering excitement concern.
 
“oh, mr. sherlock holmes!” cried, glancing one of
 us, finally, woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my
 companion, “i glad come. driven tell
 so. know james didn’t it. know it, want to
 start upon work knowing it, too. never let doubt upon

“i hope may clear him, miss turner,” said sherlock holmes. “you may

“but read evidence. formed conclusion? do

“i think probable.”
 
“there, now!” cried, throwing back head looking defiantly

lestrade shrugged shoulders. “i afraid colleague has
 little quick forming conclusions,” said.
 
“but right. oh! know right. james never it. and
 quarrel father, sure reason he

“in way?” asked holmes.
 
“it time hide anything. james father many
 disagreements me. mr. mccarthy anxious should
 marriage us. james always loved as
 brother sister; course young seen little
 life yet, and—and—well, naturally wish anything
 like yet. quarrels, this, sure, one of
 them.”
 
“and father?” asked holmes. “was favour union?”
 
“no, averse also. one mr. mccarthy favour of
 it.” quick blush passed fresh young face holmes shot one
 keen, questioning glances her.
 
“thank information,” said he. “may see father i
 call to-morrow?”
 
“i afraid doctor won’t allow it.”
 
“the doctor?”
 
“yes, heard? poor father never strong years

“ha! victoria! important.”

“yes, certainly.”
 
“thank you, miss turner. material assistance me.”
 
“you will tell news to-morrow. doubt will go

“i will, miss turner.”
 
“i must go home now, dad ill, misses i
 leave him. good-bye, god help undertaking.” hurried
 room impulsively entered, heard the
 wheels carriage rattle street.
 
“i ashamed you, holmes,” said lestrade dignity few
 minutes’ silence. “why raise hopes bound to
 disappoint? over-tender heart, call cruel.”
 
“i think see way clearing james mccarthy,” said holmes.
 “have order see prison?”
 
“yes, me.”
 
“then shall reconsider resolution going out. still

 cloudless. nine o’clock lestrade called us the
 carriage, set hatherley farm boscombe pool.
 
“there serious news morning,” lestrade observed. “it said
 mr. turner, hall, ill life despaired of.”
 
“an elderly man, presume?” said holmes.
 
“about sixty; constitution shattered life

“we got deductions inferences,” said lestrade,
 winking me. “i find hard enough tackle facts, holmes, without

“you right,” said holmes demurely; “you find hard to

“anyhow, grasped one fact seem find difficult to

“and is—”
 
“that mccarthy senior met death mccarthy junior all

“well, moonshine brighter thing fog,” said holmes, laughing.
 “but much mistaken hatherley farm upon the

“yes, it.” widespread, comfortable-looking building,

 bent downward, shoulders bowed, lips compressed, veins
 stood like whipcord long, sinewy neck. nostrils seemed
 dilate purely animal lust chase, mind so
 absolutely concentrated upon matter question or
 remark fell unheeded upon ears, or, most, provoked a
 quick, impatient snarl reply. swiftly silently made way
 along track ran meadows, way the
 woods boscombe pool. damp, marshy ground, that
 district, marks many feet, upon path and

ten minutes regained cab drove back into

“this may interest you, lestrade,” remarked, holding out. “the

“they have, however, allowed policeman, may remain the

“has come to-night?”
 
“no. orders stay house.”

“there one thing,” said john openshaw. rummaged coat

holmes moved lamp, bent sheet paper, which
 showed ragged edge indeed torn book. it
 headed, “march, 1869,” beneath following enigmatical
 notices:

“7th. set pips mccauley, paramore, john swain st.

“9th. mccauley cleared.
 
“10th. john swain cleared.
 
“12th. visited paramore. well.”
 
“thank you!” said holmes, folding paper returning our

“what shall do?”
 
“there one thing do. must done once. must put

“do think revenge, anything sort, present. think

sherlock holmes sat time silence, head sunk
 forward eyes bent upon red glow fire. lit
 pipe, leaning back chair watched blue smoke-rings

“i think, watson,” remarked last, “that cases have

“save, perhaps, sign four.”
 
“well, yes. save, perhaps, that. yet john openshaw seems me
 walking amid even greater perils sholtos.”
 
“but you,” asked, “formed definite conception what
 perils are?”
 
“there can question nature,” answered.
 
“then they? k. k. k., pursue this
 unhappy family?”
 
sherlock holmes closed eyes placed elbows upon arms of
 chair, finger-tips together. “the ideal reasoner,” he
 remarked, “would, shown single fact its
 bearings, deduce chain events led up

“i never have.”
 
holmes turned leaves book upon knee. “here is,”
 said presently:

“no, no. crime,” said sherlock holmes, laughing. “only one those

ix. adventure engineer’s thumb

 latter may afforded finer field acute and

 results. story has, believe, told the
 newspapers, but, like narratives, effect much less

 facts slowly evolve eyes, mystery
 clears gradually away new discovery furnishes step which
 leads complete truth. time circumstances made a
 deep impression upon me, lapse two years hardly served

“i’ve got here,” whispered, jerking thumb shoulder;

“it’s new patient,” whispered. “i thought i’d bring round

 waiting,” said i, sitting library-chair. “you fresh from
 night journey, understand, monotonous
 occupation.”
 
“oh, night called monotonous,” said he, laughed. he
 laughed heartily, high, ringing note, leaning back his
 chair shaking sides. medical instincts rose against
 laugh.
 
“stop it!” cried; “pull together!” poured some
 water caraffe.
 
useless, however. one hysterical

“i making fool myself,” gasped.
 
“not all. drink this.” dashed brandy water, the

“that’s better!” said he. “and now, doctor, perhaps kindly

“excellent! surgeon.”
 
“it question hydraulics, see, came within own

“ha!” cried i, “if anything nature problem you

“oh, heard fellow,” answered visitor, “and should

“i’ll better. i’ll take round myself.”
 
“i immensely obliged you.”

“yes; shall feel easy told story.”
 
“then servant will call cab, shall an

sherlock holmes was, expected, lounging sitting-room in
 dressing-gown, reading agony column _the times_ smoking
 before-breakfast pipe, composed plugs and
 dottles left smokes day before, carefully dried and

“it easy see experience common one, mr.

“thank you,” said patient, “but felt another man since the
