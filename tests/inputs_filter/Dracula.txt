(_kept in shorthand._)
 

_3 may. bistritz._--left munich at 8:35 p. m., on 1st may, arriving at
 vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an
 hour late. buda-pesth seems wonderful place, from the glimpse which i
 got of it from the train and the little i could walk through the
 streets. i feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
 late and would start as near the correct time as possible. the
 impression i had was that we were leaving the west and entering the
 east; the most western of splendid bridges over the danube, which is
 here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of turkish
 rule.
 
we left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to klausenburgh.
 here i stopped for the night at the hotel royale. i had for dinner, or
 rather supper, chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
 very good but thirsty. (_mem._, get recipe for mina.) i asked the
 waiter, and said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a
 national dish, i should be able to get it anywhere along the
 carpathians. i found my smattering of german very useful here; indeed, i
 don’t know how i should be able to get on without it.
 
having had some time at my disposal when in london, i had visited the
 british museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library
 regarding transylvania; it had struck that some foreknowledge of the
 country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
 nobleman of that country. i find that the district named is in the
 extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
 transylvania, moldavia and bukovina, in the midst of the carpathian
 mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of europe. i was
 not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
 castle dracula, as there are maps of this country as yet to compare
 with our own ordnance survey maps; but i found that bistritz, the post
 town named by count dracula, is fairly well-known place. i shall enter
 here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when i talk over my
 travels with mina.
 
in the population of transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
 saxons in the south, and mixed with them the wallachs, who are the
 descendants of the dacians; magyars in the west, and szekelys in the
 east and north. i am going among the latter, who claim to be descended
 from attila and the huns. this may be so, for when the magyars conquered
 the country in the eleventh century they found the huns settled in it. i
 read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the
 horseshoe of the carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of
 imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_mem._, i
 must ask the count all about them.)
 
i did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for i had
 all sorts of queer dreams. there was dog howling all night under my
 window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been
 the paprika, for i had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was
 still thirsty. towards morning i slept and was wakened by the continuous
 knocking at my door, so i guess i must have been sleeping soundly then.
 i had for breakfast more paprika, and sort of porridge of maize flour
 which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a
 very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (_mem._, get recipe
 for this also.) i had to hurry breakfast, for the train started little
 before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to
 the station at 7:30 i had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour
 before we began to move. it seems to that the further east you go the
 more unpunctual are the trains. what ought they to be in china?
 
all day long we seemed to dawdle through country which was full of
 beauty of every kind. sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
 top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
 rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
 of them to be subject to great floods. it takes lot of water, and
 running strong, to sweep the outside edge of river clear. at every
 station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
 of attire. some of them were just like the peasants at home or those i
 saw coming through france and germany, with short jackets and round hats
 and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. the women
 looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
 about the waist. they had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
 and most of them had big belts with lot of strips of something
 fluttering from them like the dresses in ballet, but of course there
 were petticoats under them. the strangest figures we saw were the
 slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
 hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
 heavy leather belts, nearly foot wide, all studded over with brass
 nails. they wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
 had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. they are very
 picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. on the stage they would be
 set down at once as some old oriental band of brigands. they are,
 however, i am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural
 self-assertion.
 
it was on the dark side of twilight when we got to bistritz, which is a
 very interesting old place. being practically on the frontier--for the
 borgo pass leads from it into bukovina--it has had very stormy
 existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. fifty years ago series
 of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
 occasions. at the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
 siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
 proper being assisted by famine and disease.
 
count dracula had directed to go to the golden krone hotel, which i
 found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
 course i wanted to see all i could of the ways of the country. i was
 evidently expected, for when i got near the door i faced a
 cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
 undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
 fitting almost too tight for modesty. when i came close she bowed and
 said, “the herr englishman?” “yes,” i said, “jonathan harker.” she
 smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
 who had followed her to the door. went, but immediately returned with
 letter:--
 
“my friend.--welcome to the carpathians. i am anxiously expecting
 you. sleep well to-night. at three to-morrow the diligence will
 start for bukovina; place on it is kept for you. at the borgo
 pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. i trust
 that your journey from london has been happy one, and that you
 will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.
 
“your friend,
 
“dracula.”
 

_4 may._--i found that my landlord had got letter from the count,
 directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
 making inquiries as to details seemed somewhat reticent, and
 pretended that could not understand my german. this could not be
 true, because up to then had understood it perfectly; at least, he
 answered my questions exactly as if did. and his wife, the old
 lady who had received me, looked at each other in frightened sort of
 way. mumbled out that the money had been sent in letter, and that
 was all knew. when i asked him if knew count dracula, and could
 tell anything of his castle, both and his wife crossed themselves,
 and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
 further. it was so near the time of starting that i had time to ask
 any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
 comforting.
 
just before i was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
 very hysterical way:
 
“must you go? oh! young herr, must you go?” she was in such an excited
 state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what german she knew, and
 mixed it all up with some other language which i did not know at all. i
 was just able to follow her by asking many questions. when i told her
 that i must go at once, and that i was engaged on important business,
 she asked again:
 
“do you know what day it is?” i answered that it was the fourth of may.
 she shook her head as she said again:
 
“oh, yes! i know that! i know that, but do you know what day it is?” on
 my saying that i did not understand, she went on:
 
“it is the eve of st. george’s day. do you not know that to-night, when
 the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
 full sway? do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?”
 she was in such evident distress that i tried to comfort her, but
 without effect. finally she went down on her knees and implored not
 to go; at least to wait day or two before starting. it was all very
 ridiculous but i did not feel comfortable. however, there was business
 to be done, and i could allow nothing to interfere with it. i therefore
 tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as i could, that i thanked
 her, but my duty was imperative, and that i must go. she then rose and
 dried her eyes, and taking crucifix from her neck offered it to me. i
 did not know what to do, for, as an english churchman, i have been
 taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
 seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
 state of mind. she saw, i suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
 rosary round my neck, and said, “for your mother’s sake,” and went out
 of the room. i am writing up this part of the diary whilst i am waiting
 for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
 round my neck. whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostly
 traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, i do not know, but i
 am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. if this book should
 ever reach mina before i do, let it bring my good-bye. here comes the
 coach!
 
* * * * *
 
_5 may. the castle._--the grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is
 high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or
 hills i know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are
 mixed. i am not sleepy, and, as i am not to be called till i awake,
 naturally i write till sleep comes. there are many odd things to put
 down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that i dined too well before i
 left bistritz, let put down my dinner exactly. i dined on what they
 called “robber steak”--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red
 pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple
 style of the london cat’s meat! the wine was golden mediasch, which
 produces queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not
 disagreeable. i had only couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.
 
when i got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and i saw him
 talking with the landlady. they were evidently talking of me, for every
 now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting
 on the bench outside the door--which they call by name meaning
 “word-bearer”--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them
 pityingly. i could hear lot of words often repeated, queer words, for
 there were many nationalities in the crowd; so i quietly got my polyglot
 dictionary from my bag and looked them out. i must say they were not
 cheering to me, for amongst them were “ordog”--satan, “pokol”--hell,
 “stregoica”--witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”--both of which mean the same
 thing, one being slovak and the other servian for something that is
 either were-wolf or vampire. (_mem._, i must ask the count about these
 superstitions)
 
when we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time
 swelled to considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and
 pointed two fingers towards me. with some difficulty i got a
 fellow-passenger to tell what they meant; would not answer at
 first, but on learning that i was english, explained that it was a
 charm or guard against the evil eye. this was not very pleasant for me,
 just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one
 seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that i
 could not but be touched. i shall never forget the last glimpse which i
 had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing
 themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of
 rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the
 centre of the yard. then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
 the whole front of the box-seat--“gotza” they call them--cracked his big
 whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on
 our journey.
 
i soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the
 scene as we drove along, although had i known the language, or rather
 languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, i might not have
 been able to throw them off so easily. before us lay green sloping
 land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned
 with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the
 road. there was everywhere bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,
 plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by i could see the green grass under
 the trees spangled with the fallen petals. in and out amongst these
 green hills of what they call here the “mittel land” ran the road,
 losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the
 straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the
 hillsides like tongues of flame. the road was rugged, but still we
 seemed to fly over it with feverish haste. i could not understand then
 what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no
 time in reaching borgo prund. i was told that this road is in summertime
 excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter
 snows. in this respect it is different from the general run of roads in
 the carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept
 in too good order. of old the hospadars would not repair them, lest the
 turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,
 and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.
 
beyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopes
 of forest up to the lofty steeps of the carpathians themselves. right
 and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon
 them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,
 deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where
 grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and
 pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where
 the snowy peaks rose grandly. here and there seemed mighty rifts in the
 mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again
 the white gleam of falling water. one of my companions touched my arm as
 we swept round the base of hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered
 peak of mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to
 be right before us:--
 
“look! isten szek!”--“god’s seat!”--and crossed himself reverently.
 
as we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind
 us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. this was
 emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the
 sunset, and seemed to glow out with delicate cool pink. here and there
 we passed cszeks and slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but i noticed
 that goitre was painfully prevalent. by the roadside were many crosses,
 and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. here and there
 was peasant man or woman kneeling before shrine, who did not even
 turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of
 devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. there were
 many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here
 and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems
 shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. now and
 again we passed leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant’s cart--with its
 long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the
 road. on this were sure to be seated quite group of home-coming
 peasants, the cszeks with their white, and the slovaks with their
 coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long
 staves, with axe at end. as the evening fell it began to get very cold,
 and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
 gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which
 ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the
 pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of
 late-lying snow. sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods
 that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of
 greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a
 peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and
 grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset
 threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the
 carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. sometimes the
 hills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could
 only go slowly. i wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,
 but the driver would not hear of it. “no, no,” said; “you must not
 walk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then added, with what he
 evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for looked round to catch the
 approving smile of the rest--“and you may have enough of such matters
 before you go to sleep.” the only stop would make was moment’s
 pause to light his lamps.
 
when it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the
 passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as
 though urging him to further speed. lashed the horses unmercifully
 with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on
 to further exertions. then through the darkness i could see sort of
 patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were cleft in the
 hills. the excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach
 rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like boat tossed on a
 stormy sea. i had to hold on. the road grew more level, and we appeared
 to fly along. then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each
 side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the borgo pass. one
 by one several of the passengers offered gifts, which they pressed
 upon with an earnestness which would take denial; these were
 certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good
 faith, with kindly word, and blessing, and that strange mixture of
 fear-meaning movements which i had seen outside the hotel at
 bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
 then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the
 passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the
 darkness. it was evident that something very exciting was either
 happening or expected, but though i asked each passenger, one would
 give the slightest explanation. this state of excitement kept on for
 some little time; and at last we saw before us the pass opening out on
 the eastern side. there were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the
 air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. it seemed as though the
 mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got
 into the thunderous one. i was now myself looking out for the conveyance
 which was to take to the count. each moment i expected to see the
 glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. the only light
 was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our
 hard-driven horses rose in white cloud. we could see now the sandy
 road lying white before us, but there was on it sign of vehicle.
 the passengers drew back with sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock
 my own disappointment. i was already thinking what i had best do, when
 the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which i
 could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low tone; i
 thought it was “an hour less than the time.” then turning to me, said
 in german worse than my own:--
 
“there is carriage here. the herr is not expected after all. will
 now come on to bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better
 the next day.” whilst was speaking the horses began to neigh and
 snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. then,
 amongst chorus of screams from the peasants and universal crossing
 of themselves, calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook
 us, and drew up beside the coach. i could see from the flash of our
 lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and
 splendid animals. they were driven by tall man, with long brown
 beard and great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. i
 could only see the gleam of pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red
 in the lamplight, as turned to us. said to the driver:--
 
“you are early to-night, my friend.” the man stammered in reply:--
 
“the english herr was in hurry,” to which the stranger replied:--
 
“that is why, i suppose, you wished him to go on to bukovina. you cannot
 deceive me, my friend; i know too much, and my horses are swift.” as he
 spoke smiled, and the lamplight fell on hard-looking mouth, with
 very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. one of my
 companions whispered to another the line from burger’s “lenore”:--
 
“denn die todten reiten schnell”--
 (“for the dead travel fast.”)
 
the strange driver evidently heard the words, for looked up with a
 gleaming smile. the passenger turned his face away, at the same time
 putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “give the herr’s
 luggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were
 handed out and put in the calèche. then i descended from the side of the
 coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping with a
 hand which caught my arm in grip of steel; his strength must have been
 prodigious. without word shook his reins, the horses turned, and we
 swept into the darkness of the pass. as i looked back i saw the steam
 from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected
 against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. then
 the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept
 on their way to bukovina. as they sank into the darkness i felt a
 strange chill, and lonely feeling came over me; but cloak was thrown
 over my shoulders, and rug across my knees, and the driver said in
 excellent german:--
 
“the night is chill, mein herr, and my master the count bade take all
 care of you. there is flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the
 country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” i did not take
 any, but it was comfort to know it was there all the same. i felt a
 little strangely, and not little frightened. i think had there been
 any alternative i should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that
 unknown night journey. the carriage went at hard pace straight along,
 then we made complete turn and went along another straight road. it
 seemed to that we were simply going over and over the same ground
 again; and so i took note of some salient point, and found that this was
 so. i would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but
 i really feared to do so, for i thought that, placed as i was, any
 protest would have had effect in case there had been an intention to
 delay. by-and-by, however, as i was curious to know how time was
 passing, i struck match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was
 within few minutes of midnight. this gave sort of shock, for i
 suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my
 recent experiences. i waited with sick feeling of suspense.
 
then dog began to howl somewhere in farmhouse far down the road--a
 long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. the sound was taken up by
 another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which
 now sighed softly through the pass, wild howling began, which seemed
 to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp
 it through the gloom of the night. at the first howl the horses began to
 strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they
 quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after runaway from
 sudden fright. then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each
 side of us began louder and sharper howling--that of wolves--which
 affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for i was minded to
 jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged
 madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them
 from bolting. in few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to
 the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able
 to descend and to stand before them. petted and soothed them, and
 whispered something in their ears, as i have heard of horse-tamers
 doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became
 quite manageable again, though they still trembled. the driver again
 took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at great pace. this
 time, after going to the far side of the pass, suddenly turned down a
 narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.
 
soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the
 roadway till we passed as through tunnel; and again great frowning
 rocks guarded us boldly on either side. though we were in shelter, we
 could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the
 rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.
 it grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,
 so that soon we and all around us were covered with white blanket. the
 keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew
 fainter as we went on our way. the baying of the wolves sounded nearer
 and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. i
 grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. the driver,
 however, was not in the least disturbed; kept turning his head to
 left and right, but i could not see anything through the darkness.
 
suddenly, away on our left, i saw faint flickering blue flame. the
 driver saw it at the same moment; at once checked the horses, and,
 jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. i did not know
 what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while
 i wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without word took
 his seat, and we resumed our journey. i think i must have fallen asleep
 and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated
 endlessly, and now looking back, it is like sort of awful nightmare.
 once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness
 around us i could watch the driver’s motions. went rapidly to where
 the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem
 to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering few stones,
 formed them into some device. once there appeared strange optical
 effect: when stood between and the flame did not obstruct it,
 for i could see its ghostly flicker all the same. this startled me, but
 as the effect was only momentary, i took it that my eyes deceived me
 straining through the darkness. then for time there were blue
 flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the
 wolves around us, as though they were following in moving circle.
 
at last there came time when the driver went further afield than he
 had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse
 than ever and to snort and scream with fright. i could not see any cause
 for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just
 then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the
 jagged crest of beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light i saw
 around us ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,
 with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. they were hundred times more
 terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.
 for myself, i felt sort of paralysis of fear. it is only when man
 feels himself face to face with such horrors that can understand
 their true import.
 
all at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had
 some peculiar effect on them. the horses jumped about and reared, and
 looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in way painful to see;
 but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they
 had perforce to remain within it. i called to the coachman to come, for
 it seemed to that our only chance was to try to break out through the
 ring and to aid his approach. i shouted and beat the side of the
 calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as
 to give him chance of reaching the trap. how came there, i know
 not, but i heard his voice raised in tone of imperious command, and
 looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. as swept his
 long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves
 fell back and back further still. just then heavy cloud passed across
 the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.
 
when i could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the
 wolves had disappeared. this was all so strange and uncanny that a
 dreadful fear came upon me, and i was afraid to speak or move. the time
 seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete
 darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. we kept on
 ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main
 always ascending. suddenly, i became conscious of the fact that the
 driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a
 vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came ray of light,
 and whose broken battlements showed jagged line against the moonlit
 sky.

jonathan harker’s journal--_continued_
 

_5 may._--i must have been asleep, for certainly if i had been fully
 awake i must have noticed the approach of such remarkable place. in
 the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark
 ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than
 it really is. i have not yet been able to see it by daylight.
 
when the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand
 to assist to alight. again i could not but notice his prodigious
 strength. his hand actually seemed like steel vice that could have
 crushed mine if had chosen. then took out my traps, and placed
 them on the ground beside as i stood close to great door, old and
 studded with large iron nails, and set in projecting doorway of
 massive stone. i could see even in the dim light that the stone was
 massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and
 weather. as i stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the
 reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one
 of the dark openings.
 
i stood in silence where i was, for i did not know what to do. of bell
 or knocker there was sign; through these frowning walls and dark
 window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. the
 time i waited seemed endless, and i felt doubts and fears crowding upon
 me. what sort of place had i come to, and among what kind of people?
 what sort of grim adventure was it on which i had embarked? was this a
 customary incident in the life of solicitor’s clerk sent out to
 explain the purchase of london estate to foreigner? solicitor’s
 clerk! mina would not like that. solicitor--for just before leaving
 london i got word that my examination was successful; and i am now a
 full-blown solicitor! i began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if
 i were awake. it all seemed like horrible nightmare to me, and i
 expected that i should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with
 the dawn struggling in through the windows, as i had now and again felt
 in the morning after day of overwork. but my flesh answered the
 pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. i was indeed awake
 and among the carpathians. all i could do now was to be patient, and to
 wait the coming of the morning.
 
just as i had come to this conclusion i heard heavy step approaching
 behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of coming
 light. then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of
 massive bolts drawn back. key was turned with the loud grating noise
 of long disuse, and the great door swung back.
 
within, stood tall old man, clean shaven save for long white
 moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without single speck
 of colour about him anywhere. held in his hand an antique silver
 lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,
 throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the
 open door. the old man motioned in with his right hand with courtly
 gesture, saying in excellent english, but with strange intonation:--
 
“welcome to my house! enter freely and of your own will!” made no
 motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like statue, as though his
 gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. the instant, however, that
 i had stepped over the threshold, moved impulsively forward, and
 holding out his hand grasped mine with strength which made wince,
 an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as
 ice--more like the hand of dead than living man. again said:--
 
“welcome to my house. come freely. go safely; and leave something of the
 happiness you bring!” the strength of the handshake was so much akin to
 that which i had noticed in the driver, whose face i had not seen, that
 for moment i doubted if it were not the same person to whom i was
 speaking; so to make sure, i said interrogatively:--
 
“count dracula?” bowed in courtly way as replied:--
 
“i am dracula; and i bid you welcome, mr. harker, to my house. come in;
 the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.” as was
 speaking, put the lamp on bracket on the wall, and stepping out,
 took my luggage; had carried it in before i could forestall him. i
 protested but insisted:--
 
“nay, sir, you are my guest. it is late, and my people are not
 available. let see to your comfort myself.” insisted on carrying
 my traps along the passage, and then up great winding stair, and
 along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang
 heavily. at the end of this threw open heavy door, and i rejoiced
 to see within well-lit room in which table was spread for supper,
 and on whose mighty hearth great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
 flamed and flared.
 
the count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing
 the room, opened another door, which led into small octagonal room lit
 by single lamp, and seemingly without window of any sort. passing
 through this, opened another door, and motioned to enter. it was a
 welcome sight; for here was great bedroom well lighted and warmed with
 another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were
 fresh--which sent hollow roar up the wide chimney. the count himself
 left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before closed the
 door:--
 
“you will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your
 toilet. i trust you will find all you wish. when you are ready, come
 into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.”
 
the light and warmth and the count’s courteous welcome seemed to have
 dissipated all my doubts and fears. having then reached my normal state,
 i discovered that i was half famished with hunger; so making hasty
 toilet, i went into the other room.
 
i found supper already laid out. my host, who stood on one side of the
 great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made graceful wave of
 his hand to the table, and said:--
 
“i pray you, be seated and sup how you please. you will, i trust, excuse
 that i do not join you; but i have dined already, and i do not sup.”
 
i handed to him the sealed letter which mr. hawkins had entrusted to me.
 opened it and read it gravely; then, with charming smile, handed
 it to to read. one passage of it, at least, gave thrill of
 pleasure.
 
“i must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady i am constant
 sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to
 come; but i am happy to say i can send sufficient substitute, one in
 whom i have every possible confidence. is young man, full of energy
 and talent in his own way, and of very faithful disposition. is
 discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. shall
 be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take
 your instructions in all matters.”
 
the count himself came forward and took off the cover of dish, and i
 fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. this, with some cheese
 and salad and bottle of old tokay, of which i had two glasses, was
 my supper. during the time i was eating it the count asked many
 questions as to my journey, and i told him by degrees all i had
 experienced.
 
by this time i had finished my supper, and by my host’s desire had drawn
 up chair by the fire and begun to smoke cigar which offered me,
 at the same time excusing himself that did not smoke. i had now an
 opportunity of observing him, and found him of very marked
 physiognomy.
 
his face was strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the
 thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and
 hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. his
 eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy
 hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. the mouth, so far as i
 could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather
 cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over
 the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a
 man of his years. for the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops
 extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm
 though thin. the general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.
 
hitherto i had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
 in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing
 them now close to me, i could not but notice that they were rather
 coarse--broad, with squat fingers. strange to say, there were hairs in
 the centre of the palm. the nails were long and fine, and cut to sharp
 point. as the count leaned over and his hands touched me, i could not
 repress shudder. it may have been that his breath was rank, but a
 horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what i would, i could
 not conceal. the count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a
 grim sort of smile, which showed more than had yet done his
 protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the
 fireplace. we were both silent for while; and as i looked towards the
 window i saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. there seemed a
 strange stillness over everything; but as i listened i heard as if from
 down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. the count’s eyes
 gleamed, and said:--
 
“listen to them--the children of the night. what music they make!”
 seeing, i suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he
 added:--
 
“ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the
 hunter.” then rose and said:--
 
“but you must be tired. your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you
 shall sleep as late as you will. i have to be away till the afternoon;
 so sleep well and dream well!” with courteous bow, opened for me
 himself the door to the octagonal room, and i entered my bedroom....
 
i am all in of wonders. i doubt; i fear; i think strange things,
 which i dare not confess to my own soul. god keep me, if only for the
 sake of those dear to me!
 
* * * * *
 
_7 may._--it is again early morning, but i have rested and enjoyed the
 last twenty-four hours. i slept till late in the day, and awoke of my
 own accord. when i had dressed myself i went into the room where we had
 supped, and found cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the
 pot being placed on the hearth. there was card on the table, on which
 was written:--
 
“i have to be absent for while. do not wait for me.--d.” i set to and
 enjoyed hearty meal. when i had done, i looked for bell, so that i
 might let the servants know i had finished; but i could not find one.
 there are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the
 extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. the table service
 is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.
 the curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of
 my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have
 been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,
 though in excellent order. i saw something like them in hampton court,
 but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. but still in none of
 the rooms is there mirror. there is not even toilet glass on my
 table, and i had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before i
 could either shave or brush my hair. i have not yet seen servant
 anywhere, or heard sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.
 some time after i had finished my meal--i do not know whether to call it
 breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o’clock when i had
 it--i looked about for something to read, for i did not like to go about
 the castle until i had asked the count’s permission. there was
 absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing
 materials; so i opened another door in the room and found sort of
 library. the door opposite mine i tried, but found it locked.
 
in the library i found, to my great delight, vast number of english
 books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and
 newspapers. table in the centre was littered with english magazines
 and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. the books
 were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political
 economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to england and english life
 and customs and manners. there were even such books of reference as the
 london directory, the “red” and “blue” books, whitaker’s almanac, the
 army and navy lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the
 law list.
 
whilst i was looking at the books, the door opened, and the count
 entered. saluted in hearty way, and hoped that i had had good
 night’s rest. then went on:--
 
“i am glad you found your way in here, for i am sure there is much that
 will interest you. these companions”--and laid his hand on some of
 the books--“have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever
 since i had the idea of going to london, have given many, many hours
 of pleasure. through them i have come to know your great england; and to
 know her is to love her. i long to go through the crowded streets of
 your mighty london, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of
 humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes
 it what it is. but alas! as yet i only know your tongue through books.
 to you, my friend, i look that i know it to speak.”
 
“but, count,” i said, “you know and speak english thoroughly!” bowed
 gravely.
 
“i thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet i
 fear that i am but little way on the road i would travel. true, i know
 the grammar and the words, but yet i know not how to speak them.”
 
“indeed,” i said, “you speak excellently.”
 
“not so,” answered. “well, i know that, did i move and speak in your
 london, none there are who would not know for stranger. that is not
 enough for me. here i am noble; i am _boyar_; the common people know me,
 and i am master. but stranger in strange land, is one; men
 know him not--and to know not is to care not for. i am content if i am
 like the rest, so that man stops if see me, or pause in his
 speaking if hear my words, ‘ha, ha! stranger!’ i have been so long
 master that i would be master still--or at least that none other should
 be master of me. you come to not alone as agent of my friend peter
 hawkins, of exeter, to tell all about my new estate in london. you
 shall, i trust, rest here with awhile, so that by our talking i may
 learn the english intonation; and i would that you tell when i make
 error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. i am sorry that i had to be
 away so long to-day; but you will, i know, forgive one who has so many
 important affairs in hand.”
 
of course i said all i could about being willing, and asked if i might
 come into that room when i chose. answered: “yes, certainly,” and
 added:--
 
“you may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are
 locked, where of course you will not wish to go. there is reason that
 all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with
 my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.” i said i was sure of
 this, and then went on:--
 
“we are in transylvania; and transylvania is not england. our ways are
 not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. nay, from
 what you have told of your experiences already, you know something of
 what strange things there may be.”
 
this led to much conversation; and as it was evident that wanted to
 talk, if only for talking’s sake, i asked him many questions regarding
 things that had already happened to or come within my notice.
 sometimes sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by
 pretending not to understand; but generally answered all i asked most
 frankly. then as time went on, and i had got somewhat bolder, i asked
 him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for
 instance, why the coachman went to the places where had seen the blue
 flames. then explained to that it was commonly believed that on a
 certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits
 are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place
 where treasure has been concealed. “that treasure has been hidden,” he
 went on, “in the region through which you came last night, there can be
 but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the
 wallachian, the saxon, and the turk. why, there is hardly foot of soil
 in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,
 patriots or invaders. in old days there were stirring times, when the
 austrian and the hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out
 to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited
 their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep
 destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. when the invader
 was triumphant found but little, for whatever there was had been
 sheltered in the friendly soil.”
 
“but how,” said i, “can it have remained so long undiscovered, when
 there is sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?”
 the count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,
 sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; answered:--
 
“because your peasant is at heart coward and fool! those flames only
 appear on one night; and on that night man of this land will, if he
 can help it, stir without his doors. and, dear sir, even if did he
 would not know what to do. why, even the peasant that you tell of who
 marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight
 even for his own work. even you would not, i dare be sworn, be able to
 find these places again?”
 
“there you are right,” i said. “i know more than the dead where even
 to look for them.” then we drifted into other matters.
 
“come,” said at last, “tell of london and of the house which you
 have procured for me.” with an apology for my remissness, i went into my
 own room to get the papers from my bag. whilst i was placing them in
 order i heard rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as i
 passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp
 lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. the lamps were also lit
 in the study or library, and i found the count lying on the sofa,
 reading, of all things in the world, an english bradshaw’s guide. when i
 came in cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him i
 went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. was interested in
 everything, and asked myriad questions about the place and its
 surroundings. clearly had studied beforehand all could get on the
 subject of the neighbourhood, for evidently at the end knew very much
 more than i did. when i remarked this, answered:--
 
“well, but, my friend, is it not needful that i should? when i go there
 i shall be all alone, and my friend harker jonathan--nay, pardon me, i
 fall into my country’s habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend
 jonathan harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. will be
 in exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my
 other friend, peter hawkins. so!”
 
we went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at
 purfleet. when i had told him the facts and got his signature to the
 necessary papers, and had written letter with them ready to post to
 mr. hawkins, began to ask how i had come across so suitable a
 place. i read to him the notes which i had made at the time, and which i
 inscribe here:--
 
“at purfleet, on by-road, i came across just such place as seemed to
 be required, and where was displayed dilapidated notice that the place
 was for sale. it is surrounded by high wall, of ancient structure,
 built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for large number of
 years. the closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with
 rust.
 
“the estate is called carfax, doubt corruption of the old _quatre
 face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of
 the compass. it contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by
 the solid stone wall above mentioned. there are many trees on it, which
 make it in places gloomy, and there is deep, dark-looking pond or
 small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and
 flows away in fair-sized stream. the house is very large and of all
 periods back, i should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone
 immensely thick, with only few windows high up and heavily barred with
 iron. it looks like part of keep, and is close to an old chapel or
 church. i could not enter it, as i had not the key of the door leading
 to it from the house, but i have taken with my kodak views of it from
 various points. the house has been added to, but in very straggling
 way, and i can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must
 be very great. there are but few houses close at hand, one being very
 large house only recently added to and formed into private lunatic
 asylum. it is not, however, visible from the grounds.”
 
when i had finished, said:--
 
“i am glad that it is old and big. i myself am of an old family, and to
 live in new house would kill me. house cannot be made habitable in a
 day; and, after all, how few days go to make up century. i rejoice
 also that there is chapel of old times. we transylvanian nobles love
 not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. i seek not
 gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and
 sparkling waters which please the young and gay. i am longer young;
 and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not
 attuned to mirth. moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the
 shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken
 battlements and casements. i love the shade and the shadow, and would
 be alone with my thoughts when i may.” somehow his words and his look
 did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his
 smile look malignant and saturnine.
 
presently, with an excuse, left me, asking to put all my papers
 together. was some little time away, and i began to look at some of
 the books around me. one was an atlas, which i found opened naturally at
 england, as if that map had been much used. on looking at it i found in
 certain places little rings marked, and on examining these i noticed
 that one was near london on the east side, manifestly where his new
 estate was situated; the other two were exeter, and whitby on the
 yorkshire coast.
 
it was the better part of an hour when the count returned. “aha!” he
 said; “still at your books? good! but you must not work always. come; i
 am informed that your supper is ready.” took my arm, and we went into
 the next room, where i found an excellent supper ready on the table. the
 count again excused himself, as had dined out on his being away from
 home. but sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst i ate.
 after supper i smoked, as on the last evening, and the count stayed with
 me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour
 after hour. i felt that it was getting very late indeed, but i did not
 say anything, for i felt under obligation to meet my host’s wishes in
 every way. i was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified
 me; but i could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at
 the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.
 they say that people who are near death die generally at the change to
 the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and
 tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere
 can well believe it. all at once we heard the crow of cock coming up
 with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; count
 dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--
 
“why, there is the morning again! how remiss i am to let you stay up so
 long. you must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of
 england less interesting, so that i may not forget how time flies by
 us,” and, with courtly bow, quickly left me.
 
i went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to
 notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all i could see was the
 warm grey of quickening sky. so i pulled the curtains again, and have
 written of this day.
 
* * * * *
 
_8 may._--i began to fear as i wrote in this book that i was getting too
 diffuse; but now i am glad that i went into detail from the first, for
 there is something so strange about this place and all in it that i
 cannot but feel uneasy. i wish i were safe out of it, or that i had
 never come. it may be that this strange night-existence is telling on
 me; but would that that were all! if there were any one to talk to i
 could bear it, but there is one. i have only the count to speak with,
 and he!--i fear i am myself the only living soul within the place. let
 be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help to bear up, and
 imagination must not run riot with me. if it does i am lost. let say
 at once how i stand--or seem to.
 
i only slept few hours when i went to bed, and feeling that i could
 not sleep any more, got up. i had hung my shaving glass by the window,
 and was just beginning to shave. suddenly i felt hand on my shoulder,
 and heard the count’s voice saying to me, “good-morning.” i started, for
 it amazed that i had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass
 covered the whole room behind me. in starting i had cut myself slightly,
 but did not notice it at the moment. having answered the count’s
 salutation, i turned to the glass again to see how i had been mistaken.
 this time there could be error, for the man was close to me, and i
 could see him over my shoulder. but there was reflection of him in
 the mirror! the whole room behind was displayed; but there was no
 sign of man in it, except myself. this was startling, and, coming on
 the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague
 feeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count is near; but at
 the instant i saw that the cut had bled little, and the blood was
 trickling over my chin. i laid down the razor, turning as i did so half
 round to look for some sticking plaster. when the count saw my face, his
 eyes blazed with sort of demoniac fury, and suddenly made grab at
 my throat. i drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which
 held the crucifix. it made an instant change in him, for the fury passed
 so quickly that i could hardly believe that it was ever there.
 
“take care,” said, “take care how you cut yourself. it is more
 dangerous than you think in this country.” then seizing the shaving
 glass, went on: “and this is the wretched thing that has done the
 mischief. it is foul bauble of man’s vanity. away with it!” and
 opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, flung
 out the glass, which was shattered into thousand pieces on the stones
 of the courtyard far below. then withdrew without word. it is very
 annoying, for i do not see how i am to shave, unless in my watch-case or
 the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.
 
when i went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but i could
 not find the count anywhere. so i breakfasted alone. it is strange that
 as yet i have not seen the count eat or drink. must be very
 peculiar man! after breakfast i did little exploring in the castle. i
 went out on the stairs, and found room looking towards the south. the
 view was magnificent, and from where i stood there was every opportunity
 of seeing it. the castle is on the very edge of terrible precipice. a
 stone falling from the window would fall thousand feet without
 touching anything! as far as the eye can reach is of green tree
 tops, with occasionally deep rift where there is chasm. here and
 there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through
 the forests.
 
but i am not in heart to describe beauty, for when i had seen the view i
 explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and
 bolted. in place save from the windows in the castle walls is there
 an available exit.
 
the castle is veritable prison, and i am prisoner!
 



chapter iii
 
jonathan harker’s journal--_continued_
 

when i found that i was prisoner sort of wild feeling came over me.
 i rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of
 every window i could find; but after little the conviction of my
 helplessness overpowered all other feelings. when i look back after a
 few hours i think i must have been mad for the time, for i behaved much
 as rat does in trap. when, however, the conviction had come to me
 that i was helpless i sat down quietly--as quietly as i have ever done
 anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. i
 am thinking still, and as yet have come to definite conclusion. of
 one thing only am i certain; that it is use making my ideas known to
 the count. knows well that i am imprisoned; and as has done it
 himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, would only deceive
 if i trusted him fully with the facts. so far as i can see, my only
 plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes
 open. i am, i know, either being deceived, like baby, by my own fears,
 or else i am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, i need, and
 shall need, all my brains to get through.
 
i had hardly come to this conclusion when i heard the great door below
 shut, and knew that the count had returned. did not come at once into
 the library, so i went cautiously to my own room and found him making
 the bed. this was odd, but only confirmed what i had all along
 thought--that there were servants in the house. when later i saw him
 through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the
 dining-room, i was assured of it; for if does himself all these
 menial offices, surely it is proof that there is one else to do them.
 this gave fright, for if there is one else in the castle, it
 must have been the count himself who was the driver of the coach that
 brought here. this is terrible thought; for if so, what does it
 mean that could control the wolves, as did, by only holding up his
 hand in silence. how was it that all the people at bistritz and on the
 coach had some terrible fear for me? what meant the giving of the
 crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? bless
 that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a
 comfort and strength to whenever i touch it. it is odd that thing
 which i have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous
 should in time of loneliness and trouble be of help. is it that there
 is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is medium,
 tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? some
 time, if it may be, i must examine this matter and try to make up my
 mind about it. in the meantime i must find out all i can about count
 dracula, as it may help to understand. to-night may talk of
 himself, if i turn the conversation that way. i must be very careful,
 however, not to awake his suspicion.
 
* * * * *
 
_midnight._--i have had long talk with the count. i asked him few
 questions on transylvania history, and warmed up to the subject
 wonderfully. in his speaking of things and people, and especially of
 battles, spoke as if had been present at them all. this he
 afterwards explained by saying that to _boyar_ the pride of his house
 and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their
 fate is his fate. whenever spoke of his house always said “we,”
 and spoke almost in the plural, like king speaking. i wish i could put
 down all said exactly as said it, for to it was most
 fascinating. it seemed to have in it whole history of the country. he
 grew excited as spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great
 white moustache and grasping anything on which laid his hands as
 though would crush it by main strength. one thing said which i
 shall put down as nearly as i can; for it tells in its way the story of
 his race:--
 
“we szekelys have right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood
 of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. here,
 in the whirlpool of european races, the ugric tribe bore down from
 iceland the fighting spirit which thor and wodin gave them, which their
 berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of europe, ay,
 and of asia and africa too, till the peoples thought that the
 were-wolves themselves had come. here, too, when they came, they found
 the huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like living flame,
 till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those
 old witches, who, expelled from scythia had mated with the devils in the
 desert. fools, fools! what devil or what witch was ever so great as
 attila, whose blood is in these veins?” held up his arms. “is it a
 wonder that we were conquering race; that we were proud; that when the
 magyar, the lombard, the avar, the bulgar, or the turk poured his
 thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? is it strange that when
 arpad and his legions swept through the hungarian fatherland found us
 here when reached the frontier; that the honfoglalas was completed
 there? and when the hungarian flood swept eastward, the szekelys were
 claimed as kindred by the victorious magyars, and to us for centuries
 was trusted the guarding of the frontier of turkey-land; ay, and more
 than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the turks say,
 ‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ who more gladly than we
 throughout the four nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its
 warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the king? when was
 redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of cassova, when the
 flags of the wallach and the magyar went down beneath the crescent? who
 was it but one of my own race who as voivode crossed the danube and beat
 the turk on his own ground? this was dracula indeed! woe was it that
 his own unworthy brother, when had fallen, sold his people to the
 turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! was it not this dracula,
 indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in later age again and
 again brought his forces over the great river into turkey-land; who,
 when was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though had
 to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being
 slaughtered, since knew that alone could ultimately triumph! they
 said that thought only of himself. bah! what good are peasants
 without leader? where ends the war without brain and heart to
 conduct it? again, when, after the battle of mohács, we threw off the
 hungarian yoke, we of the dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for
 our spirit would not brook that we were not free. ah, young sir, the
 szekelys--and the dracula as their heart’s blood, their brains, and
 their swords--can boast record that mushroom growths like the
 hapsburgs and the romanoffs can never reach. the warlike days are over.
 blood is too precious thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and
 the glories of the great races are as tale that is told.”
 
it was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_mem._, this
 diary seems horribly like the beginning of the “arabian nights,” for
 everything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of hamlet’s
 father.)
 
* * * * *
 
_12 may._--let begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by
 books and figures, and of which there can be doubt. i must not
 confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own
 observation, or my memory of them. last evening when the count came from
 his room began by asking questions on legal matters and on the
 doing of certain kinds of business. i had spent the day wearily over
 books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the
 matters i had been examining at lincoln’s inn. there was certain
 method in the count’s inquiries, so i shall try to put them down in
 sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.
 
first, asked if man in england might have two solicitors or more. i
 told him might have dozen if wished, but that it would not be
 wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only
 one could act at time, and that to change would be certain to militate
 against his interest. seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to
 ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to
 attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case
 local help were needed in place far from the home of the banking
 solicitor. i asked him to explain more fully, so that i might not by any
 chance mislead him, so said:--
 
“i shall illustrate. your friend and mine, mr. peter hawkins, from under
 the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at exeter, which is far from
 london, buys for through your good self my place at london. good! now
 here let say frankly, lest you should think it strange that i have
 sought the services of one so far off from london instead of some one
 resident there, that my motive was that local interest might be
 served save my wish only; and as one of london residence might, perhaps,
 have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, i went thus afield to
 seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. now, suppose
 i, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to newcastle, or
 durham, or harwich, or dover, might it not be that it could with more
 ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?” i answered that
 certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had system of
 agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on
 instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing
 himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by
 him without further trouble.
 
“but,” said he, “i could be at liberty to direct myself. is it not so?”
 
“of course,” i replied; and “such is often done by men of business, who
 do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.”
 
“good!” said, and then went on to ask about the means of making
 consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of
 difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded
 against. i explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,
 and certainly left under the impression that would have made a
 wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that did not think of or
 foresee. for man who was never in the country, and who did not
 evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were
 wonderful. when had satisfied himself on these points of which had
 spoken, and i had verified all as well as i could by the books
 available, suddenly stood up and said:--
 
“have you written since your first letter to our friend mr. peter
 hawkins, or to any other?” it was with some bitterness in my heart that
 i answered that i had not, that as yet i had not seen any opportunity of
 sending letters to anybody.
 
“then write now, my young friend,” said, laying heavy hand on my
 shoulder: “write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will
 please you, that you shall stay with until month from now.”
 
“do you wish to stay so long?” i asked, for my heart grew cold at the
 thought.
 
“i desire it much; nay, i will take refusal. when your master,
 employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,
 it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. i have not
 stinted. is it not so?”
 
what could i do but bow acceptance? it was mr. hawkins’s interest, not
 mine, and i had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while count
 dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing
 which made remember that i was prisoner, and that if i wished it i
 could have choice. the count saw his victory in my bow, and his
 mastery in the trouble of my face, for began at once to use them, but
 in his own smooth, resistless way:--
 
“i pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things
 other than business in your letters. it will doubtless please your
 friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting
 home to them. is it not so?” as spoke handed three sheets of
 note-paper and three envelopes. they were all of the thinnest foreign
 post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,
 with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, i understood
 as well as if had spoken that i should be careful what i wrote, for
 would be able to read it. so i determined to write only formal notes
 now, but to write fully to mr. hawkins in secret, and also to mina, for
 to her i could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the count, if he
 did see it. when i had written my two letters i sat quiet, reading a
 book whilst the count wrote several notes, referring as wrote them to
 some books on his table. then took up my two and placed them with his
 own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door
 had closed behind him, i leaned over and looked at the letters, which
 were face down on the table. i felt compunction in doing so, for
 under the circumstances i felt that i should protect myself in every way
 i could.
 
one of the letters was directed to samuel f. billington, no. 7, the
 crescent, whitby, another to herr leutner, varna; the third was to
 coutts & co., london, and the fourth to herren klopstock & billreuth,
 bankers, buda-pesth. the second and fourth were unsealed. i was just
 about to look at them when i saw the door-handle move. i sank back in my
 seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and
 to resume my book before the count, holding still another letter in his
 hand, entered the room. took up the letters on the table and stamped
 them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--
 
“i trust you will forgive me, but i have much work to do in private this
 evening. you will, i hope, find all things as you wish.” at the door he
 turned, and after moment’s pause said:--
 
“let advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let warn you with all
 seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any
 chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. it is old, and has
 many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. be
 warned! should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then
 haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be
 safe. but if you be not careful in this respect, then”--he finished his
 speech in gruesome way, for motioned with his hands as if were
 washing them. i quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any
 dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom
 and mystery which seemed closing around me.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--i endorse the last words written, but this time there is no
 doubt in question. i shall not fear to sleep in any place where is
 not. i have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--i imagine that
 my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.
 
when left i went to my room. after little while, not hearing any
 sound, i came out and went up the stone stair to where i could look out
 towards the south. there was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,
 inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness
 of the courtyard. looking out on this, i felt that i was indeed in
 prison, and i seemed to want breath of fresh air, though it were of
 the night. i am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.
 it is destroying my nerve. i start at my own shadow, and am full of all
 sorts of horrible imaginings. god knows that there is ground for my
 terrible fear in this accursed place! i looked out over the beautiful
 expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as
 day. in the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows
 in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. the mere beauty seemed
 to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath i drew. as i
 leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving storey
 below me, and somewhat to my left, where i imagined, from the order of
 the rooms, that the windows of the count’s own room would look out. the
 window at which i stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though
 weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many day since
 the case had been there. i drew back behind the stonework, and looked
 carefully out.
 
what i saw was the count’s head coming out from the window. i did not
 see the face, but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of his
 back and arms. in any case i could not mistake the hands which i had had
 so many opportunities of studying. i was at first interested and
 somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small matter will interest
 and amuse man when is prisoner. but my very feelings changed to
 repulsion and terror when i saw the whole man slowly emerge from the
 window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,
 _face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. at
 first i could not believe my eyes. i thought it was some trick of the
 moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but i kept looking, and it could
 be delusion. i saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the
 stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus
 using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable
 speed, just as lizard moves along wall.
 
what manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the
 semblance of man? i feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering
 me; i am in fear--in awful fear--and there is escape for me; i am
 encompassed about with terrors that i dare not think of....
 
* * * * *
 
_15 may._--once more have i seen the count go out in his lizard fashion.
 moved downwards in sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and good
 deal to the left. vanished into some hole or window. when his head
 had disappeared, i leaned out to try and see more, but without
 avail--the distance was too great to allow proper angle of sight. i
 knew had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to
 explore more than i had dared to do as yet. i went back to the room, and
 taking lamp, tried all the doors. they were all locked, as i had
 expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but i went down the
 stone stairs to the hall where i had entered originally. i found i could
 pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the
 door was locked, and the key was gone! that key must be in the count’s
 room; i must watch should his door be unlocked, so that i may get it and
 escape. i went on to make thorough examination of the various stairs
 and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. one or two
 small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in
 them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. at last,
 however, i found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it
 seemed to be locked, gave little under pressure. i tried it harder,
 and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came
 from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door
 rested on the floor. here was an opportunity which i might not have
 again, so i exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that
 i could enter. i was now in wing of the castle further to the right
 than the rooms i knew and storey lower down. from the windows i could
 see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the
 windows of the end room looking out both west and south. on the latter
 side, as well as to the former, there was great precipice. the castle
 was built on the corner of great rock, so that on three sides it was
 quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or
 bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,
 impossible to position which had to be guarded, were secured. to the
 west was great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged
 mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with
 mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and
 crannies of the stone. this was evidently the portion of the castle
 occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of
 comfort than any i had seen. the windows were curtainless, and the
 yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to
 see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over
 all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. my
 lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but i was
 glad to have it with me, for there was dread loneliness in the place
 which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. still, it was better
 than living alone in the rooms which i had come to hate from the
 presence of the count, and after trying little to school my nerves, i
 found soft quietude come over me. here i am, sitting at little oak
 table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much
 thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my
 diary in shorthand all that has happened since i closed it last. it is
 nineteenth century up-to-date with vengeance. and yet, unless my
 senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own
 which mere “modernity” cannot kill.
 
* * * * *
 
_later: the morning of 16 may._--god preserve my sanity, for to this i
 am reduced. safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.
 whilst i live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that i may not
 go mad, if, indeed, i be not mad already. if i be sane, then surely it
 is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this
 hateful place the count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone i
 can look for safety, even though this be only whilst i can serve his
 purpose. great god! merciful god! let be calm, for out of that way
 lies madness indeed. i begin to get new lights on certain things which
 have puzzled me. up to now i never quite knew what shakespeare meant
 when made hamlet say:--
 
“my tablets! quick, my tablets!
 ’tis meet that i put it down,” etc.,
 
for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock
 had come which must end in its undoing, i turn to my diary for repose.
 the habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.
 
the count’s mysterious warning frightened at the time; it frightens
 more now when i think of it, for in future has fearful hold upon
 me. i shall fear to doubt what may say!
 
when i had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and
 pen in my pocket i felt sleepy. the count’s warning came into my mind,
 but i took pleasure in disobeying it. the sense of sleep was upon me,
 and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. the soft
 moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave sense of freedom
 which refreshed me. i determined not to return to-night to the
 gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat
 and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for
 their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. i drew great
 couch out of its place near the corner, so that as i lay, i could look
 at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for
 the dust, composed myself for sleep. i suppose i must have fallen
 asleep; i hope so, but i fear, for all that followed was startlingly
 real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the
 morning, i cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.
 
i was not alone. the room was the same, unchanged in any way since i
 came into it; i could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,
 my own footsteps marked where i had disturbed the long accumulation of
 dust. in the moonlight opposite were three young women, ladies by
 their dress and manner. i thought at the time that i must be dreaming
 when i saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw
 shadow on the floor. they came close to me, and looked at for some
 time, and then whispered together. two were dark, and had high aquiline
 noses, like the count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be
 almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. the other was
 fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes
 like pale sapphires. i seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it
 in connection with some dreamy fear, but i could not recollect at the
 moment how or where. all three had brilliant white teeth that shone like
 pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. there was something
 about them that made uneasy, some longing and at the same time some
 deadly fear. i felt in my heart wicked, burning desire that they would
 kiss with those red lips. it is not good to note this down, lest some
 day it should meet mina’s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.
 they whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a
 silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have
 come through the softness of human lips. it was like the intolerable,
 tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by cunning hand.
 the fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her
 on. one said:--
 
“go on! you are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to
 begin.” the other added:--
 
“he is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.” i lay quiet,
 looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.
 the fair girl advanced and bent over till i could feel the movement
 of her breath upon me. sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent
 the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with bitter
 underlying the sweet, bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.
 
i was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under
 the lashes. the girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply
 gloating. there was deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling
 and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips
 like an animal, till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shining
 on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp
 teeth. lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of
 my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. then she
 paused, and i could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked
 her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. then the
 skin of my throat began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the hand that
 is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. i could feel the soft,
 shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,
 and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.
 i closed my eyes in languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating
 heart.
 
but at that instant, another sensation swept through as quick as
 lightning. i was conscious of the presence of the count, and of his
 being as if lapped in storm of fury. as my eyes opened involuntarily i
 saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with
 giant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the
 white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with
 passion. but the count! never did i imagine such wrath and fury, even to
 the demons of the pit. his eyes were positively blazing. the red light
 in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. his
 face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;
 the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like heaving bar
 of white-hot metal. with fierce sweep of his arm, hurled the woman
 from him, and then motioned to the others, as though were beating
 them back; it was the same imperious gesture that i had seen used to the
 wolves. in voice which, though low and almost in whisper seemed to
 cut through the air and then ring round the room said:--
 
“how dare you touch him, any of you? how dare you cast eyes on him when
 i had forbidden it? back, i tell you all! this man belongs to me! beware
 how you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.” the fair girl,
 with laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--
 
“you yourself never loved; you never love!” on this the other women
 joined, and such mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the
 room that it almost made faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure
 of fiends. then the count turned, after looking at my face attentively,
 and said in soft whisper:--
 
“yes, i too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. is it
 not so? well, now i promise you that when i am done with him you shall
 kiss him at your will. now go! go! i must awaken him, for there is work
 to be done.”
 
“are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with low laugh,
 as she pointed to the bag which had thrown upon the floor, and which
 moved as though there were some living thing within it. for answer he
 nodded his head. one of the women jumped forward and opened it. if my
 ears did not deceive there was gasp and low wail, as of a
 half-smothered child. the women closed round, whilst i was aghast with
 horror; but as i looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful
 bag. there was door near them, and they could not have passed me
 without my noticing. they simply seemed to fade into the rays of the
 moonlight and pass out through the window, for i could see outside the
 dim, shadowy forms for moment before they entirely faded away.
 
then the horror overcame me, and i sank down unconscious.
 



chapter iv
 
jonathan harker’s journal--_continued_
 

i awoke in my own bed. if it be that i had not dreamt, the count must
 have carried here. i tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but
 could not arrive at any unquestionable result. to be sure, there were
 certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by
 in manner which was not my habit. my watch was still unwound, and i am
 rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and
 many such details. but these things are proof, for they may have been
 evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or
 another, i had certainly been much upset. i must watch for proof. of one
 thing i am glad: if it was that the count carried here and undressed
 me, must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. i
 am sure this diary would have been mystery to him which would not
 have brooked. would have taken or destroyed it. as i look round this
 room, although it has been to so full of fear, it is now sort of
 sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who
 were--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.
 
* * * * *
 
_18 may._--i have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for
 i _must_ know the truth. when i got to the doorway at the top of the
 stairs i found it closed. it had been so forcibly driven against the
 jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. i could see that the bolt
 of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.
 i fear it was dream, and must act on this surmise.
 
* * * * *
 
_19 may._--i am surely in the toils. last night the count asked in
 the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here
 was nearly done, and that i should start for home within few days,
 another that i was starting on the next morning from the time of the
 letter, and the third that i had left the castle and arrived at
 bistritz. i would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
 of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the count whilst i
 am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his
 suspicion and to arouse his anger. knows that i know too much, and
 that i must not live, lest i be dangerous to him; my only chance is to
 prolong my opportunities. something may occur which will give a
 chance to escape. i saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath
 which was manifest when hurled that fair woman from him. explained
 to that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would
 ensure ease of mind to my friends; and assured with so much
 impressiveness that would countermand the later letters, which would
 be held over at bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my
 prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new
 suspicion. i therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked
 him what dates i should put on the letters. calculated minute, and
 then said:--
 
“the first should be june 12, the second june 19, and the third june
 29.”
 
i know now the span of my life. god help me!
 
* * * * *
 
_28 may._--there is chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to
 send word home. band of szgany have come to the castle, and are
 encamped in the courtyard. these szgany are gipsies; i have notes of
 them in my book. they are peculiar to this part of the world, though
 allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. there are thousands
 of them in hungary and transylvania, who are almost outside all law.
 they attach themselves as rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and
 call themselves by his name. they are fearless and without religion,
 save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the romany
 tongue.
 
i shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them
 posted. i have already spoken them through my window to begin
 acquaintanceship. they took their hats off and made obeisance and many
 signs, which, however, i could not understand any more than i could
 their spoken language....
 
* * * * *
 
i have written the letters. mina’s is in shorthand, and i simply ask mr.
 hawkins to communicate with her. to her i have explained my situation,
 but without the horrors which i may only surmise. it would shock and
 frighten her to death were i to expose my heart to her. should the
 letters not carry, then the count shall not yet know my secret or the
 extent of my knowledge....
 
* * * * *
 
i have given the letters; i threw them through the bars of my window
 with gold piece, and made what signs i could to have them posted. the
 man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them
 in his cap. i could do more. i stole back to the study, and began to
 read. as the count did not come in, i have written here....
 
* * * * *
 
the count has come. sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest
 voice as opened two letters:--
 
“the szgany has given these, of which, though i know not whence they
 come, i shall, of course, take care. see!”--he must have looked at
 it--“one is from you, and to my friend peter hawkins; the other”--here
 caught sight of the strange symbols as opened the envelope, and
 the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--“the
 other is vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! it is
 not signed. well! so it cannot matter to us.” and calmly held letter
 and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. then he
 went on:--
 
“the letter to hawkins--that i shall, of course, send on, since it is
 yours. your letters are sacred to me. your pardon, my friend, that
 unknowingly i did break the seal. will you not cover it again?” held
 out the letter to me, and with courteous bow handed clean
 envelope. i could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. when
 went out of the room i could hear the key turn softly. minute later
 i went over and tried it, and the door was locked.
 
when, an hour or two after, the count came quietly into the room, his
 coming awakened me, for i had gone to sleep on the sofa. was very
 courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that i had been
 sleeping, said:--
 
“so, my friend, you are tired? get to bed. there is the surest rest. i
 may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours
 to me; but you will sleep, i pray.” i passed to my room and went to bed,
 and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. despair has its own calms.
 
* * * * *
 
_31 may._--this morning when i woke i thought i would provide myself
 with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so
 that i might write in case i should get an opportunity, but again a
 surprise, again shock!
 
every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,
 relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that
 might be useful to were i once outside the castle. i sat and pondered
 awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and i made search of my
 portmanteau and in the wardrobe where i had placed my clothes.
 
the suit in which i had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and
 rug; i could find trace of them anywhere. this looked like some new
 scheme of villainy....
 
* * * * *
 
_17 june._--this morning, as i was sitting on the edge of my bed
 cudgelling my brains, i heard without cracking of whips and pounding
 and scraping of horses’ feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.
 with joy i hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great
 leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of
 each pair slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty
 sheepskin, and high boots. they had also their long staves in hand. i
 ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the
 main hall, as i thought that way might be opened for them. again a
 shock: my door was fastened on the outside.
 
then i ran to the window and cried to them. they looked up at me
 stupidly and pointed, but just then the “hetman” of the szgany came out,
 and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they
 laughed. henceforth effort of mine, piteous cry or agonised
 entreaty, would make them even look at me. they resolutely turned away.
 the leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick
 rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the slovaks
 handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. when
 they were all unloaded and packed in great heap in one corner of the
 yard, the slovaks were given some money by the szgany, and spitting on
 it for luck, lazily went each to his horse’s head. shortly afterwards, i
 heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.
 
* * * * *
 
_24 june, before morning._--last night the count left early, and
 locked himself into his own room. as soon as i dared i ran up the
 winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. i
 thought i would watch for the count, for there is something going on.
 the szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of
 some kind. i know it, for now and then i hear far-away muffled sound
 as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some
 ruthless villainy.
 
i had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when i saw
 something coming out of the count’s window. i drew back and watched
 carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. it was new shock to to
 find that had on the suit of clothes which i had worn whilst
 travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which i
 had seen the women take away. there could be doubt as to his quest,
 and in my garb, too! this, then, is his new scheme of evil: that will
 allow others to see me, as they think, so that may both leave
 evidence that i have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own
 letters, and that any wickedness which may do shall by the local
 people be attributed to me.
 
it makes rage to think that this can go on, and whilst i am shut up
 here, veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which
 is even criminal’s right and consolation.
 
i thought i would watch for the count’s return, and for long time sat
 doggedly at the window. then i began to notice that there were some
 quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. they were
 like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in
 clusters in nebulous sort of way. i watched them with sense of
 soothing, and sort of calm stole over me. i leaned back in the
 embrasure in more comfortable position, so that i could enjoy more
 fully the aërial gambolling.
 
something made start up, low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far
 below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. louder it seemed to
 ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to
 the sound as they danced in the moonlight. i felt myself struggling to
 awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,
 and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. i
 was becoming hypnotised! quicker and quicker danced the dust; the
 moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by into the mass of gloom
 beyond. more and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom
 shapes. and then i started, broad awake and in full possession of my
 senses, and ran screaming from the place. the phantom shapes, which were
 becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the
 three ghostly women to whom i was doomed. i fled, and felt somewhat
 safer in my own room, where there was moonlight and where the lamp
 was burning brightly.
 
when couple of hours had passed i heard something stirring in the
 count’s room, something like sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then
 there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. with a
 beating heart, i tried the door; but i was locked in my prison, and
 could do nothing. i sat down and simply cried.
 
as i sat i heard sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a
 woman. i rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between
 the bars. there, indeed, was woman with dishevelled hair, holding her
 hands over her heart as one distressed with running. she was leaning
 against corner of the gateway. when she saw my face at the window she
 threw herself forward, and shouted in voice laden with menace:--
 
“monster, give my child!”
 
she threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same
 words in tones which wrung my heart. then she tore her hair and beat her
 breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant
 emotion. finally, she threw herself forward, and, though i could not see
 her, i could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.
 
somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, i heard the voice of the
 count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. his call seemed to be
 answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. before many minutes
 had passed pack of them poured, like pent-up dam when liberated,
 through the wide entrance into the courtyard.
 
there was cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but
 short. before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.
 
i could not pity her, for i knew now what had become of her child, and
 she was better dead.
 
what shall i do? what can i do? how can i escape from this dreadful
 thing of night and gloom and fear?
 
* * * * *
 
_25 june, morning._--no man knows till has suffered from the night
 how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. when the
 sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great
 gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me
 as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. my fear fell from as
 if it had been vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. i must
 take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. last
 night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal
 series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the
 earth.
 
let not think of it. action!
 
it has always been at night-time that i have been molested or
 threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. i have not yet seen the
 count in the daylight. can it be that sleeps when others wake, that
 may be awake whilst they sleep? if i could only get into his room!
 but there is possible way. the door is always locked, way for me.
 
yes, there is way, if one dares to take it. where his body has gone
 why may not another body go? i have seen him myself crawl from his
 window. why should not i imitate him, and go in by his window? the
 chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. i shall risk
 it. at the worst it can only be death; and man’s death is not a
 calf’s, and the dreaded hereafter may still be open to me. god help me
 in my task! good-bye, mina, if i fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and
 second father; good-bye, all, and last of all mina!
 
* * * * *
 
_same day, later._--i have made the effort, and god, helping me, have
 come safely back to this room. i must put down every detail in order. i
 went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south
 side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs
 around the building on this side. the stones are big and roughly cut,
 and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. i
 took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. i looked down
 once, so as to make sure that sudden glimpse of the awful depth would
 not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. i knew pretty
 well the direction and distance of the count’s window, and made for it
 as well as i could, having regard to the opportunities available. i did
 not feel dizzy--i suppose i was too excited--and the time seemed
 ridiculously short till i found myself standing on the window-sill and
 trying to raise up the sash. i was filled with agitation, however, when
 i bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. then i looked
 around for the count, but, with surprise and gladness, made discovery.
 the room was empty! it was barely furnished with odd things, which
 seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same
 style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. i looked
 for the key, but it was not in the lock, and i could not find it
 anywhere. the only thing i found was great heap of gold in one
 corner--gold of all kinds, roman, and british, and austrian, and
 hungarian, and greek and turkish money, covered with film of dust, as
 though it had lain long in the ground. none of it that i noticed was
 less than three hundred years old. there were also chains and ornaments,
 some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.
 
at one corner of the room was heavy door. i tried it, for, since i
 could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which
 was the main object of my search, i must make further examination, or
 all my efforts would be in vain. it was open, and led through stone
 passage to circular stairway, which went steeply down. i descended,
 minding carefully where i went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit
 by loopholes in the heavy masonry. at the bottom there was dark,
 tunnel-like passage, through which came deathly, sickly odour, the
 odour of old earth newly turned. as i went through the passage the smell
 grew closer and heavier. at last i pulled open heavy door which stood
 ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently
 been used as graveyard. the roof was broken, and in two places were
 steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and
 the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been
 brought by the slovaks. there was nobody about, and i made search for
 any further outlet, but there was none. then i went over every inch of
 the ground, so as not to lose chance. i went down even into the
 vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was dread to
 my very soul. into two of these i went, but saw nothing except fragments
 of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, i made a
 discovery.
 
there, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a
 pile of newly dug earth, lay the count! was either dead or asleep, i
 could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the
 glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all
 their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. but there was sign of
 movement, pulse, breath, beating of the heart. i bent over him,
 and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. could not have lain
 there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in few hours.
 by the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.
 i thought might have the keys on him, but when i went to search i saw
 the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such look of hate,
 though unconscious of or my presence, that i fled from the place, and
 leaving the count’s room by the window, crawled again up the castle
 wall. regaining my room, i threw myself panting upon the bed and tried
 to think....
 
* * * * *
 
_29 june._--to-day is the date of my last letter, and the count has
 taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again i saw him leave the
 castle by the same window, and in my clothes. as went down the wall,
 lizard fashion, i wished i had gun or some lethal weapon, that i might
 destroy him; but i fear that weapon wrought alone by man’s hand would
 have any effect on him. i dared not wait to see him return, for i feared
 to see those weird sisters. i came back to the library, and read there
 till i fell asleep.
 
i was awakened by the count, who looked at as grimly as man can
 look as said:--
 
“to-morrow, my friend, we must part. you return to your beautiful
 england, i to some work which may have such an end that we may never
 meet. your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow i shall not be
 here, but all shall be ready for your journey. in the morning come the
 szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some
 slovaks. when they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall
 bear you to the borgo pass to meet the diligence from bukovina to
 bistritz. but i am in hopes that i shall see more of you at castle
 dracula.” i suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.
 sincerity! it seems like profanation of the word to write it in
 connection with such monster, so asked him point-blank:--
 
“why may i not go to-night?”
 
“because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on mission.”
 
“but i would walk with pleasure. i want to get away at once.” smiled,
 such soft, smooth, diabolical smile that i knew there was some trick
 behind his smoothness. said:--
 
“and your baggage?”
 
“i do not care about it. i can send for it some other time.”
 
the count stood up, and said, with sweet courtesy which made rub my
 eyes, it seemed so real:--
 
“you english have saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is
 that which rules our _boyars_: ‘welcome the coming; speed the parting
 guest.’ come with me, my dear young friend. not an hour shall you wait
 in my house against your will, though sad am i at your going, and that
 you so suddenly desire it. come!” with stately gravity, he, with the
 lamp, preceded down the stairs and along the hall. suddenly he
 stopped.
 
“hark!”
 
close at hand came the howling of many wolves. it was almost as if the
 sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of great
 orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. after pause
 of moment, proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back
 the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it
 open.
 
to my intense astonishment i saw that it was unlocked. suspiciously, i
 looked all round, but could see key of any kind.
 
as the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder
 and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed
 feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. i knew then that
 to struggle at the moment against the count was useless. with such
 allies as these at his command, i could do nothing. but still the door
 continued slowly to open, and only the count’s body stood in the gap.
 suddenly it struck that this might be the moment and means of my
 doom; i was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. there
 was diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the count, and
 as last chance i cried out:--
 
“shut the door; i shall wait till morning!” and covered my face with my
 hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. with one sweep of his
 powerful arm, the count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged
 and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.
 
in silence we returned to the library, and after minute or two i went
 to my own room. the last i saw of count dracula was his kissing his hand
 to me; with red light of triumph in his eyes, and with smile that
 judas in hell might be proud of.
 
when i was in my room and about to lie down, i thought i heard a
 whispering at my door. i went to it softly and listened. unless my ears
 deceived me, i heard the voice of the count:--
 
“back, back, to your own place! your time is not yet come. wait! have
 patience! to-night is mine. to-morrow night is yours!” there was low,
 sweet ripple of laughter, and in rage i threw open the door, and saw
 without the three terrible women licking their lips. as i appeared they
 all joined in horrible laugh, and ran away.
 
i came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. it is then so near
 the end? to-morrow! to-morrow! lord, help me, and those to whom i am
 dear!
 
* * * * *
 
_30 june, morning._--these may be the last words i ever write in this
 diary. i slept till just before the dawn, and when i woke threw myself
 on my knees, for i determined that if death came should find me
 ready.
 
at last i felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning
 had come. then came the welcome cock-crow, and i felt that i was safe.
 with glad heart, i opened my door and ran down to the hall. i had seen
 that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. with hands
 that trembled with eagerness, i unhooked the chains and drew back the
 massive bolts.
 
but the door would not move. despair seized me. i pulled, and pulled, at
 the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its
 casement. i could see the bolt shot. it had been locked after i left the
 count.
 
then wild desire took to obtain that key at any risk, and i
 determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the count’s
 room. might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of
 evils. without pause i rushed up to the east window, and scrambled
 down the wall, as before, into the count’s room. it was empty, but that
 was as i expected. i could not see key anywhere, but the heap of gold
 remained. i went through the door in the corner and down the winding
 stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. i knew now well
 enough where to find the monster i sought.
 
the great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid
 was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their
 places to be hammered home. i knew i must reach the body for the key, so
 i raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then i saw
 something which filled my very soul with horror. there lay the count,
 but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair
 and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,
 and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than
 ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the
 corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. even the deep,
 burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches
 underneath were bloated. it seemed as if the whole awful creature were
 simply gorged with blood. lay like filthy leech, exhausted with his
 repletion. i shuddered as i bent over to touch him, and every sense in
 revolted at the contact; but i had to search, or i was lost. the
 coming night might see my own body banquet in similar way to those
 horrid three. i felt all over the body, but sign could i find of the
 key. then i stopped and looked at the count. there was mocking smile
 on the bloated face which seemed to drive mad. this was the being i
 was helping to transfer to london, where, perhaps, for centuries to come
 might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and
 create new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the
 helpless. the very thought drove mad. terrible desire came upon me
 to rid the world of such monster. there was lethal weapon at hand,
 but i seized shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the
 cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the
 hateful face. but as i did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full
 upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. the sight seemed to
 paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,
 merely making deep gash above the forehead. the shovel fell from my
 hand across the box, and as i pulled it away the flange of the blade
 caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid
 thing from my sight. the last glimpse i had was of the bloated face,
 blood-stained and fixed with grin of malice which would have held its
 own in the nethermost hell.
 
i thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed
 on fire, and i waited with despairing feeling growing over me. as i
 waited i heard in the distance gipsy song sung by merry voices coming
 closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the
 cracking of whips; the szgany and the slovaks of whom the count had
 spoken were coming. with last look around and at the box which
 contained the vile body, i ran from the place and gained the count’s
 room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.
 with strained ears, i listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the
 key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. there must
 have been some other means of entry, or some one had key for one of
 the locked doors. then there came the sound of many feet tramping and
 dying away in some passage which sent up clanging echo. i turned to
 run down again towards the vault, where i might find the new entrance;
 but at the moment there seemed to come violent puff of wind, and the
 door to the winding stair blew to with shock that set the dust from
 the lintels flying. when i ran to push it open, i found that it was
 hopelessly fast. i was again prisoner, and the net of doom was closing
 round more closely.
 
as i write there is in the passage below sound of many tramping feet
 and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,
 with their freight of earth. there is sound of hammering; it is the
 box being nailed down. now i can hear the heavy feet tramping again
 along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.
 
the door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is grinding of the key
 in the lock; i can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and
 shuts; i hear the creaking of lock and bolt.
 
hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,
 the crack of whips, and the chorus of the szgany as they pass into the
 distance.
 
i am alone in the castle with those awful women. faugh! mina is woman,
 and there is nought in common. they are devils of the pit!
 
i shall not remain alone with them; i shall try to scale the castle wall
 farther than i have yet attempted. i shall take some of the gold with
 me, lest i want it later. i may find way from this dreadful place.
 
and then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away
 from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his
 children still walk with earthly feet!
 
at least god’s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the
 precipice is steep and high. at its foot man may sleep--as man.
 good-bye, all! mina!
 



chapter v
 
_letter from miss mina murray to miss lucy westenra._
 

“_9 may._
 
“my dearest lucy,--
 
“forgive my long delay in writing, but i have been simply overwhelmed
 with work. the life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.
 i am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together
 freely and build our castles in the air. i have been working very hard
 lately, because i want to keep up with jonathan’s studies, and i have
 been practising shorthand very assiduously. when we are married i shall
 be able to be useful to jonathan, and if i can stenograph well enough i
 can take down what wants to say in this way and write it out for
 him on the typewriter, at which also i am practising very hard. he
 and i sometimes write letters in shorthand, and is keeping a
 stenographic journal of his travels abroad. when i am with you i
 shall keep diary in the same way. i don’t mean one of those
 two-pages-to-the-week-with-sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a
 sort of journal which i can write in whenever i feel inclined. i do not
 suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not
 intended for them. i may show it to jonathan some day if there is in it
 anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. i shall try
 to do what i see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing
 descriptions and trying to remember conversations. i am told that, with
 little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears
 said during day. however, we shall see. i will tell you of my little
 plans when we meet. i have just had few hurried lines from jonathan
 from transylvania. is well, and will be returning in about week. i
 am longing to hear all his news. it must be so nice to see strange
 countries. i wonder if we--i mean jonathan and i--shall ever see them
 together. there is the ten o’clock bell ringing. good-bye.
 
“your loving
 
“mina.
 
“tell all the news when you write. you have not told anything for
 long time. i hear rumours, and especially of tall, handsome,
 curly-haired man???”
 

_letter, lucy westenra to mina murray_.
 
“_17, chatham street_,
 
“_wednesday_.
 
“my dearest mina,--
 
“i must say you tax _very_ unfairly with being bad correspondent. i
 wrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your
 _second_. besides, i have nothing to tell you. there is really nothing
 to interest you. town is very pleasant just now, and we go good deal
 to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. as to the
 tall, curly-haired man, i suppose it was the one who was with at the
 last pop. some one has evidently been telling tales. that was mr.
 holmwood. often comes to see us, and and mamma get on very well
 together; they have so many things to talk about in common. we met some
 time ago man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already
 engaged to jonathan. is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well
 off, and of good birth. is doctor and really clever. just fancy! he
 is only nine-and-twenty, and has an immense lunatic asylum all under
 his own care. mr. holmwood introduced him to me, and called here to
 see us, and often comes now. i think is one of the most resolute men
 i ever saw, and yet the most calm. seems absolutely imperturbable. i
 can fancy what wonderful power must have over his patients. has
 curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to
 read one’s thoughts. tries this on very much with me, but i flatter
 myself has got tough nut to crack. i know that from my glass. do
 you ever try to read your own face? _i do_, and i can tell you it is not
 bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you
 have never tried it. says that i afford him curious psychological
 study, and i humbly think i do. i do not, as you know, take sufficient
 interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. dress is a
 bore. that is slang again, but never mind; arthur says that every day.
 there, it is all out. mina, we have told all our secrets to each other
 since we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and
 laughed and cried together; and now, though i have spoken, i would like
 to speak more. oh, mina, couldn’t you guess? i love him. i am blushing
 as i write, for although i _think_ loves me, has not told so in
 words. but oh, mina, i love him; i love him; i love him! there, that
 does good. i wish i were with you, dear, sitting by the fire
 undressing, as we used to sit; and i would try to tell you what i feel.
 i do not know how i am writing this even to you. i am afraid to stop,
 or i should tear up the letter, and i don’t want to stop, for i _do_ so
 want to tell you all. let hear from you _at once_, and tell all
 that you think about it. mina, i must stop. good-night. bless in your
 prayers; and, mina, pray for my happiness.
 
“lucy.
 
“p.s.--i need not tell you this is secret. good-night again.
 
“l.”
 
_letter, lucy westenra to mina murray_.
 
“_24 may_.
 
“my dearest mina,--
 
“thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. it was so
 nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.
 
“my dear, it never rains but it pours. how true the old proverbs are.
 here am i, who shall be twenty in september, and yet i never had a
 proposal till to-day, not real proposal, and to-day i have had three.
 just fancy! three proposals in one day! isn’t it awful! i feel sorry,
 really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. oh, mina, i am so
 happy that i don’t know what to do with myself. and three proposals!
 but, for goodness’ sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they would be
 getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured
 and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at
 least. some girls are so vain! you and i, mina dear, who are engaged and
 are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can
 despise vanity. well, i must tell you about the three, but you must keep
 it secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, jonathan. you
 will tell him, because i would, if i were in your place, certainly tell
 arthur. woman ought to tell her husband everything--don’t you think
 so, dear?--and i must be fair. men like women, certainly their wives, to
 be quite as fair as they are; and women, i am afraid, are not always
 quite as fair as they should be. well, my dear, number one came just
 before lunch. i told you of him, dr. john seward, the lunatic-asylum
 man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. was very cool
 outwardly, but was nervous all the same. had evidently been schooling
 himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he
 almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don’t generally do
 when they are cool, and then when wanted to appear at ease kept
 playing with lancet in way that made nearly scream. spoke to
 me, mina, very straightforwardly. told how dear i was to him,
 though had known so little, and what his life would be with to
 help and cheer him. was going to tell how unhappy would be if i
 did not care for him, but when saw cry said that was brute
 and would not add to my present trouble. then broke off and asked if
 i could love him in time; and when i shook my head his hands trembled,
 and then with some hesitation asked if i cared already for any one
 else. put it very nicely, saying that did not want to wring my
 confidence from me, but only to know, because if woman’s heart was
 free man might have hope. and then, mina, i felt sort of duty to
 tell him that there was some one. i only told him that much, and then he
 stood up, and looked very strong and very grave as took both my
 hands in his and said hoped i would be happy, and that if i ever
 wanted friend i must count him one of my best. oh, mina dear, i can’t
 help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. being
 proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn’t at
 all happy thing when you have to see poor fellow, whom you know
 loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to
 know that, matter what may say at the moment, you are passing
 quite out of his life. my dear, i must stop here at present, i feel so
 miserable, though i am so happy.
 
“_evening._
 
“arthur has just gone, and i feel in better spirits than when i left
 off, so i can go on telling you about the day. well, my dear, number two
 came after lunch. is such nice fellow, an american from texas, and
 looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he
 has been to so many places and has had such adventures. i sympathise
 with poor desdemona when she had such dangerous stream poured in her
 ear, even by black man. i suppose that we women are such cowards that
 we think man will save us from fears, and we marry him. i know now
 what i would do if i were man and wanted to make girl love me. no, i
 don’t, for there was mr. morris telling us his stories, and arthur never
 told any, and yet---- my dear, i am somewhat previous. mr. quincey p.
 morris found alone. it seems that man always does find girl
 alone. no, doesn’t, for arthur tried twice to _make_ chance, and i
 helping him all i could; i am not ashamed to say it now. i must tell you
 beforehand that mr. morris doesn’t always speak slang--that is to say,
 never does so to strangers or before them, for is really well
 educated and has exquisite manners--but found out that it amused me
 to hear him talk american slang, and whenever i was present, and there
 was one to be shocked, said such funny things. i am afraid, my
 dear, has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he
 has to say. but this is way slang has. i do not know myself if i shall
 ever speak slang; i do not know if arthur likes it, as i have never
 heard him use any as yet. well, mr. morris sat down beside and looked
 as happy and jolly as could, but i could see all the same that was
 very nervous. took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--
 
“‘miss lucy, i know i ain’t good enough to regulate the fixin’s of your
 little shoes, but i guess if you wait till you find man that is you
 will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. won’t
 you just hitch up alongside of and let us go down the long road
 together, driving in double harness?’
 
“well, did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’t seem
 half so hard to refuse him as it did poor dr. seward; so i said, as
 lightly as i could, that i did not know anything of hitching, and that i
 wasn’t broken to harness at all yet. then said that had spoken in
 light manner, and hoped that if had made mistake in doing so
 on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, i would forgive him. he
 really did look serious when was saying it, and i couldn’t help
 feeling bit serious too--i know, mina, you will think horrid
 flirt--though i couldn’t help feeling sort of exultation that was
 number two in one day. and then, my dear, before i could say word he
 began pouring out perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very
 heart and soul at my feet. looked so earnest over it that i shall
 never again think that man must be playful always, and never earnest,
 because is merry at times. i suppose saw something in my face
 which checked him, for suddenly stopped, and said with sort of
 manly fervour that i could have loved him for if i had been free:--
 
“‘lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, i know. i should not be here
 speaking to you as i am now if i did not believe you clean grit, right
 through to the very depths of your soul. tell me, like one good fellow
 to another, is there any one else that you care for? and if there is
 i’ll never trouble you hair’s breadth again, but will be, if you will
 let me, very faithful friend.’
 
“my dear mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy
 of them? here was i almost making fun of this great-hearted, true
 gentleman. i burst into tears--i am afraid, my dear, you will think
 this very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and i really felt very
 badly. why can’t they let girl marry three men, or as many as want
 her, and save all this trouble? but this is heresy, and i must not say
 it. i am glad to say that, though i was crying, i was able to look into
 mr. morris’s brave eyes, and i told him out straight:--
 
“‘yes, there is some one i love, though has not told yet that he
 even loves me.’ i was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a
 light came into his face, and put out both his hands and took mine--i
 think i put them into his--and said in hearty way:--
 
“‘that’s my brave girl. it’s better worth being late for chance of
 winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. don’t
 cry, my dear. if it’s for me, i’m hard nut to crack; and i take it
 standing up. if that other fellow doesn’t know his happiness, well, he’d
 better look for it soon, or he’ll have to deal with me. little girl,
 your honesty and pluck have made friend, and that’s rarer than a
 lover; it’s more unselfish anyhow. my dear, i’m going to have pretty
 lonely walk between this and kingdom come. won’t you give one kiss?
 it’ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. you can, you
 know, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be good fellow,
 my dear, and fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn’t spoken
 yet.’ that quite won me, mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and
 noble, too, to rival--wasn’t it?--and so sad; so i leant over and
 kissed him. stood up with my two hands in his, and as looked down
 into my face--i am afraid i was blushing very much--he said:--
 
“‘little girl, i hold your hand, and you’ve kissed me, and if these
 things don’t make us friends nothing ever will. thank you for your sweet
 honesty to me, and good-bye.’ wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,
 went straight out of the room without looking back, without tear or a
 quiver or pause; and i am crying like baby. oh, why must man like
 that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would
 worship the very ground trod on? i know i would if i were free--only
 i don’t want to be free. my dear, this quite upset me, and i feel i
 cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and i
 don’t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.
 
“ever your loving
 
“lucy.
 
“p.s.--oh, about number three--i needn’t tell you of number three, need
 i? besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only moment from his
 coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and was
 kissing me. i am very, very happy, and i don’t know what i have done to
 deserve it. i must only try in the future to show that i am not
 ungrateful to god for all his goodness to in sending to such a
 lover, such husband, and such friend.
 
“good-bye.”

(kept in phonograph)
 
_25 may._--ebb tide in appetite to-day. cannot eat, cannot rest, so
 diary instead. since my rebuff of yesterday i have sort of empty
 feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth
 the doing.... as i knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was
 work, i went down amongst the patients. i picked out one who has
 afforded study of much interest. is so quaint that i am
 determined to understand him as well as i can. to-day i seemed to get
 nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.
 
i questioned him more fully than i had ever done, with view to making
 myself master of the facts of his hallucination. in my manner of doing
 it there was, i now see, something of cruelty. i seemed to wish to keep
 him to the point of his madness--a thing which i avoid with the patients
 as i would the mouth of hell.
 
(_mem._, under what circumstances would i _not_ avoid the pit of hell?)
 _omnia romæ venalia sunt._ hell has its price! _verb. sap._ if there be
 anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards
 _accurately_, so i had better commence to do so, therefore--
 
r. m. renfield, ætat 59.--sanguine temperament; great physical strength;
 morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which i
 cannot make out. i presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the
 disturbing influence end in mentally-accomplished finish; possibly
 dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. in selfish men caution
 is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. what i think of
 on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is
 balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, cause, etc., is the fixed
 point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or series of
 accidents can balance it.

chapter vi
 
mina murray’s journal
 

_24 july. whitby._--lucy met at the station, looking sweeter and
 lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the crescent in
 which they have rooms. this is lovely place. the little river, the
 esk, runs through deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the
 harbour. great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the
 view seems somehow further away than it really is. the valley is
 beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land
 on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to
 see down. the houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all
 red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the
 pictures we see of nuremberg. right over the town is the ruin of whitby
 abbey, which was sacked by the danes, and which is the scene of part of
 “marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. it is most noble
 ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is
 legend that white lady is seen in one of the windows. between it and
 the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is big
 graveyard, all full of tombstones. this is to my mind the nicest spot in
 whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has full view of the
 harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called kettleness
 stretches out into the sea. it descends so steeply over the harbour that
 part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been
 destroyed. in one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches
 out over the sandy pathway far below. there are walks, with seats beside
 them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long
 looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. i shall come and
 sit here very often myself and work. indeed, i am writing now, with my
 book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are
 sitting beside me. they seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and
 talk.
 
the harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall
 stretching out into the sea, with curve outwards at the end of it, in
 the middle of which is lighthouse. heavy sea-wall runs along outside
 of it. on the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,
 and its end too has lighthouse. between the two piers there is a
 narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.
 
it is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to
 nothing, and there is merely the stream of the esk, running between
 banks of sand, with rocks here and there. outside the harbour on this
 side there rises for about half mile great reef, the sharp edge of
 which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. at the end of
 it is buoy with bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a
 mournful sound on the wind. they have legend here that when ship is
 lost bells are heard out at sea. i must ask the old man about this; he
 is coming this way....
 
is funny old man. must be awfully old, for his face is all
 gnarled and twisted like the bark of tree. tells that is
 nearly hundred, and that was sailor in the greenland fishing
 fleet when waterloo was fought. is, i am afraid, very sceptical
 person, for when i asked him about the bells at and the white lady
 at the abbey said very brusquely:--
 
“i wouldn’t fash masel’ about them, miss. them things be all wore out.
 mind, i don’t say that they never was, but i do say that they wasn’t in
 my time. they be all very well for comers and trippers, an’ the like,
 but not for nice young lady like you. them feet-folks from york and
 leeds that be always eatin’ cured herrin’s an’ drinkin’ tea an’ lookin’
 out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. i wonder masel’ who’d be
 bothered tellin’ lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of
 fool-talk.” i thought would be good person to learn interesting
 things from, so i asked him if would mind telling something about
 the whale-fishing in the old days. was just settling himself to begin
 when the clock struck six, whereupon laboured to get up, and said:--
 
“i must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. my grand-daughter doesn’t like
 to be kept waitin’ when the tea is ready, for it takes time to
 crammle aboon the grees, for there be many of ’em; an’, miss, i lack
 belly-timber sairly by the clock.”
 
hobbled away, and i could see him hurrying, as well as could, down
 the steps. the steps are great feature on the place. they lead from
 the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--i do not know how
 many--and they wind up in delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that
 horse could easily walk up and down them. i think they must originally
 have had something to do with the abbey. i shall go home too. lucy went
 out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, i did
 not go. they will be home by this.
 
* * * * *
 
_1 august._--i came up here an hour ago with lucy, and we had most
 interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come
 and join him. is evidently the sir oracle of them, and i should think
 must have been in his time most dictatorial person. will not admit
 anything, and downfaces everybody. if can’t out-argue them bullies
 them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. lucy
 was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a
 beautiful colour since she has been here. i noticed that the old men did
 not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.
 she is so sweet with old people; i think they all fell in love with her
 on the spot. even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but
 gave double share instead. i got him on the subject of the legends,
 and went off at once into sort of sermon. i must try to remember it
 and put it down:--
 
“it be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that’s what it be, an’
 nowt else. these bans an’ wafts an’ boh-ghosts an’ barguests an’ bogles
 an’ all anent them is only fit to set bairns an’ dizzy women
 a-belderin’. they be nowt but air-blebs. they, an’ all grims an’ signs
 an’ warnin’s, be all invented by parsons an’ illsome beuk-bodies an’
 railway touters to skeer an’ scunner hafflin’s, an’ to get folks to do
 somethin’ that they don’t other incline to. it makes ireful to think
 o’ them. why, it’s them that, not content with printin’ lies on paper
 an’ preachin’ them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin’ them on the
 tombstones. look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them
 steans, holdin’ up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,
 is acant--simply tumblin’ down with the weight o’ the lies wrote on
 them, ‘here lies the body’ or ‘sacred to the memory’ wrote on all of
 them, an’ yet in nigh half of them there bean’t bodies at all; an’
 the memories of them bean’t cared pinch of snuff about, much less
 sacred. lies all of them, nothin’ but lies of one kind or another! my
 gog, but it’ll be quare scowderment at the day of judgment when they
 come tumblin’ up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an’ tryin’ to
 drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them
 trimmlin’ and ditherin’, with their hands that dozzened an’ slippy from
 lyin’ in the that they can’t even keep their grup o’ them.”
 
i could see from the old fellow’s self-satisfied air and the way in
 which looked round for the approval of his cronies that was
 “showing off,” so i put in word to keep him going:--
 
“oh, mr. swales, you can’t be serious. surely these tombstones are not
 all wrong?”
 
“yabblins! there may be poorish few not wrong, savin’ where they make
 out the people too good; for there be folk that do think balm-bowl be
 like the sea, if only it be their own. the whole thing be only lies. now
 look you here; you come here stranger, an’ you see this kirk-garth.” i
 nodded, for i thought it better to assent, though i did not quite
 understand his dialect. i knew it had something to do with the church.
 went on: “and you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be
 happed here, snod an’ snog?” i assented again. “then that be just where
 the lie comes in. why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as
 old dun’s ’bacca-box on friday night.” nudged one of his companions,
 and they all laughed. “and my gog! how could they be otherwise? look at
 that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!” i went over and
 read:--
 
“edward spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of
 andres, april, 1854, æt. 30.” when i came back mr. swales went on:--
 
“who brought him home, i wonder, to hap him here? murdered off the coast
 of andres! an’ you consated his body lay under! why, i could name ye a
 dozen whose bones lie in the greenland seas above”--he pointed
 northwards--“or where the currents may have drifted them. there be the
 steans around ye. ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of
 the lies from here. this braithwaite lowrey--i knew his father, lost in
 the _lively_ off greenland in ’20; or andrew woodhouse, drowned in the
 same seas in 1777; or john paxton, drowned off cape farewell year
 later; or old john rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned
 in the gulf of finland in ’50. do ye think that all these men will have
 to make rush to whitby when the trumpet sounds? i have antherums
 aboot it! i tell ye that when they got here they’d be jommlin’ an’
 jostlin’ one another that way that it ’ud be like fight up on the ice
 in the old days, when we’d be at one another from daylight to dark, an’
 tryin’ to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.” this was
 evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his
 cronies joined in with gusto.
 
“but,” i said, “surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the
 assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to
 take their tombstones with them on the day of judgment. do you think
 that will be really necessary?”
 
“well, what else be they tombstones for? answer that, miss!”
 
“to please their relatives, i suppose.”
 
“to please their relatives, you suppose!” this said with intense
 scorn. “how will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote
 over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?” he
 pointed to stone at our feet which had been laid down as slab, on
 which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. “read the
 lies on that thruff-stean,” said. the letters were upside down to me
 from where i sat, but lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over
 and read:--
 
“sacred to the memory of george canon, who died, in the hope of a
 glorious resurrection, on july, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at
 kettleness. this tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly
 beloved son. ‘he was the only of his mother, and she was widow.’
 really, mr. swales, i don’t see anything very funny in that!” she spoke
 her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.
 
“ye don’t see aught funny! ha! ha! but that’s because ye don’t gawm the
 sorrowin’ mother was hell-cat that hated him because was
 acrewk’d--a regular lamiter was--an’ hated her so that he
 committed suicide in order that she mightn’t get an insurance she put on
 his life. blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that
 they had for scarin’ the crows with. ’twarn’t for crows then, for it
 brought the clegs and the dowps to him. that’s the way fell off the
 rocks. and, as to hopes of glorious resurrection, i’ve often heard him
 say masel’ that hoped he’d go to hell, for his mother was so pious
 that she’d be sure to go to heaven, an’ didn’t want to addle where
 she was. now isn’t that stean at any rate”--he hammered it with his
 stick as spoke--“a pack of lies? and won’t it make gabriel keckle
 when geordie comes pantin’ up the grees with the tombstean balanced on
 his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!”
 
i did not know what to say, but lucy turned the conversation as she
 said, rising up:--
 
“oh, why did you tell us of this? it is my favourite seat, and i cannot
 leave it; and now i find i must go on sitting over the grave of a
 suicide.”
 
“that won’t harm ye, my pretty; an’ it may make poor geordie gladsome to
 have so trim lass sittin’ on his lap. that won’t hurt ye. why, i’ve
 sat here off an’ on for nigh twenty years past, an’ it hasn’t done me
 harm. don’t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn’ lie
 there either! it’ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the
 tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as stubble-field.
 there’s the clock, an’ i must gang. my service to ye, ladies!” and off
 hobbled.
 
lucy and i sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we
 took hands as we sat; and she told all over again about arthur and
 their coming marriage. that made just little heart-sick, for i
 haven’t heard from jonathan for whole month.
 
* * * * *
 
_the same day._ i came up here alone, for i am very sad. there was no
 letter for me. i hope there cannot be anything the matter with jonathan.
 the clock has just struck nine. i see the lights scattered all over the
 town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;
 they run right up the esk and die away in the curve of the valley. to my
 left the view is cut off by black line of roof of the old house next
 the abbey. the sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind
 me, and there is clatter of donkey’s hoofs up the paved road below.
 the band on the pier is playing harsh waltz in good time, and further
 along the quay there is salvation army meeting in back street.
 neither of the bands hears the other, but up here i hear and see them
 both. i wonder where jonathan is and if is thinking of me! i wish he
 were here.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_5 june._--the case of renfield grows more interesting the more i get to
 understand the man. has certain qualities very largely developed;
 selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. i wish i could get at what is the
 object of the latter. seems to have some settled scheme of his own,
 but what it is i do not yet know. his redeeming quality is love of
 animals, though, indeed, has such curious turns in it that i
 sometimes imagine is only abnormally cruel. his pets are of odd
 sorts. just now his hobby is catching flies. has at present such a
 quantity that i have had myself to expostulate. to my astonishment, he
 did not break out into fury, as i expected, but took the matter in
 simple seriousness. thought for moment, and then said: “may i have
 three days? i shall clear them away.” of course, i said that would do. i
 must watch him.
 
* * * * *
 
_18 june._--he has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several
 very big fellows in box. keeps feeding them with his flies, and
 the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he
 has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his
 room.
 
* * * * *
 
_1 july._--his spiders are now becoming as great nuisance as his
 flies, and to-day i told him that must get rid of them. looked
 very sad at this, so i said that must clear out some of them, at all
 events. cheerfully acquiesced in this, and i gave him the same time
 as before for reduction. disgusted much while with him, for when a
 horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,
 caught it, held it exultantly for few moments between his finger
 and thumb, and, before i knew what was going to do, put it in his
 mouth and ate it. i scolded him for it, but argued quietly that it
 was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and
 gave life to him. this gave an idea, or the rudiment of one. i must
 watch how gets rid of his spiders. has evidently some deep problem
 in his mind, for keeps little note-book in which is always
 jotting down something. whole pages of it are filled with masses of
 figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the
 totals added in batches again, as though were “focussing” some
 account, as the auditors put it.
 
* * * * *
 
_8 july._--there is method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in
 my mind is growing. it will be whole idea soon, and then, oh,
 unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your
 conscious brother. i kept away from my friend for few days, so that i
 might notice if there were any change. things remain as they were except
 that has parted with some of his pets and got new one. has
 managed to get sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. his means
 of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. those that
 do remain, however, are well fed, for still brings in the flies by
 tempting them with his food.
 
* * * * *
 
_19 july._--we are progressing. my friend has now whole colony of
 sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. when i came
 in ran to and said wanted to ask great favour--a very,
 very great favour; and as spoke fawned on like dog. i asked
 him what it was, and said, with sort of rapture in his voice and
 bearing:--
 
“a kitten, nice little, sleek playful kitten, that i can play with,
 and teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!” i was not unprepared for this
 request, for i had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and
 vivacity, but i did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows
 should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so
 i said i would see about it, and asked him if would not rather have a
 cat than kitten. his eagerness betrayed him as answered:--
 
“oh, yes, i would like cat! i only asked for kitten lest you should
 refuse cat. one would refuse kitten, would they?” i shook
 my head, and said that at present i feared it would not be possible, but
 that i would see about it. his face fell, and i could see warning of
 danger in it, for there was sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant
 killing. the man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. i shall test him
 with his present craving and see how it will work out; then i shall know
 more.
 
* * * * *
 
_10 p. m._--i have visited him again and found him sitting in corner
 brooding. when i came in threw himself on his knees before and
 implored to let him have cat; that his salvation depended upon it.
 i was firm, however, and told him that could not have it, whereupon
 went without word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner
 where i had found him. i shall see him in the morning early.
 
* * * * *
 
_20 july._--visited renfield very early, before the attendant went his
 rounds. found him up and humming tune. was spreading out his sugar,
 which had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his
 fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with good grace. i
 looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they
 were. replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.
 there were few feathers about the room and on his pillow drop of
 blood. i said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to if
 there were anything odd about him during the day.
 
* * * * *
 
_11 a. m._--the attendant has just been to to say that renfield has
 been very sick and has disgorged whole lot of feathers. “my belief is,
 doctor,” said, “that has eaten his birds, and that just took
 and ate them raw!”
 
* * * * *
 
_11 p. m._--i gave renfield strong opiate to-night, enough to make
 even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. the thought
 that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory
 proved. my homicidal maniac is of peculiar kind. i shall have to
 invent new classification for him, and call him zoöphagous
 (life-eating) maniac; what desires is to absorb as many lives as he
 can, and has laid himself out to achieve it in cumulative way. he
 gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then
 wanted cat to eat the many birds. what would have been his later
 steps? it would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. it
 might be done if there were only sufficient cause. men sneered at
 vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! why not advance science
 in its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? had
 i even the secret of one such mind--did i hold the key to the fancy of
 even one lunatic--i might advance my own branch of science to pitch
 compared with which burdon-sanderson’s physiology or ferrier’s
 brain-knowledge would be as nothing. if only there were sufficient
 cause! i must not think too much of this, or i may be tempted; good
 cause might turn the scale with me, for may not i too be of an
 exceptional brain, congenitally?
 
how well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. i
 wonder at how many lives values man, or if at only one. has
 closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun new record. how
 many of us begin new record with each day of our lives?
 
to it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,
 and that truly i began new record. so it will be until the great
 recorder sums up and closes my ledger account with balance to
 profit or loss. oh, lucy, lucy, i cannot be angry with you, nor can i be
 angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but i must only wait on
 hopeless and work. work! work!
 
if i only could have as strong cause as my poor mad friend there--a
 good, unselfish cause to make work--that would be indeed happiness.
 

_mina murray’s journal._
 
_26 july._--i am anxious, and it soothes to express myself here; it
 is like whispering to one’s self and listening at the same time. and
 there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it
 different from writing. i am unhappy about lucy and about jonathan. i
 had not heard from jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but
 yesterday dear mr. hawkins, who is always so kind, sent letter from
 him. i had written asking him if had heard, and said the enclosed
 had just been received. it is only line dated from castle dracula,
 and says that is just starting for home. that is not like jonathan;
 i do not understand it, and it makes uneasy. then, too, lucy,
 although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in
 her sleep. her mother has spoken to about it, and we have decided
 that i am to lock the door of our room every night. mrs. westenra has
 got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and
 along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over
 with despairing cry that echoes all over the place. poor dear, she is
 naturally anxious about lucy, and she tells that her husband, lucy’s
 father, had the same habit; that would get up in the night and dress
 himself and go out, if were not stopped. lucy is to be married in the
 autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is
 to be arranged. i sympathise with her, for i do the same, only jonathan
 and i will start in life in very simple way, and shall have to try to
 make both ends meet. mr. holmwood--he is the hon. arthur holmwood, only
 of lord godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as can
 leave town, for his father is not very well, and i think dear lucy is
 counting the moments till comes. she wants to take him up to the seat
 on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of whitby. i daresay it
 is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he
 arrives.
 
* * * * *
 
_27 july._--no news from jonathan. i am getting quite uneasy about him,
 though why i should i do not know; but i do wish that would write, if
 it were only single line. lucy walks more than ever, and each night i
 am awakened by her moving about the room. fortunately, the weather is so
 hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually
 being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and i am getting nervous and
 wakeful myself. thank god, lucy’s health keeps up. mr. holmwood has been
 suddenly called to ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously
 ill. lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch
 her looks; she is trifle stouter, and her cheeks are lovely
 rose-pink. she has lost that anæmic look which she had. i pray it will
 all last.
 
* * * * *
 
_3 august._--another week gone, and news from jonathan, not even to
 mr. hawkins, from whom i have heard. oh, i do hope is not ill. he
 surely would have written. i look at that last letter of his, but
 somehow it does not satisfy me. it does not read like him, and yet it is
 his writing. there is mistake of that. lucy has not walked much in
 her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her
 which i do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching
 me. she tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room
 searching for the key.
 
_6 august._--another three days, and news. this suspense is getting
 dreadful. if i only knew where to write to or where to go to, i should
 feel easier; but one has heard word of jonathan since that last
 letter. i must only pray to god for patience. lucy is more excitable
 than ever, but is otherwise well. last night was very threatening, and
 the fishermen say that we are in for storm. i must try to watch it and
 learn the weather signs. to-day is grey day, and the sun as i write is
 hidden in thick clouds, high over kettleness. everything is grey--except
 the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;
 grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the
 grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. the sea
 is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with roar,
 muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. the horizon is lost in grey
 mist. all is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and
 there is “brool” over the that sounds like some presage of doom.
 dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in
 the mist, and seem “men like trees walking.” the fishing-boats are
 racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into
 the harbour, bending to the scuppers. here comes old mr. swales. is
 making straight for me, and i can see, by the way lifts his hat, that
 wants to talk....
 
i have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. when sat
 down beside me, said in very gentle way:--
 
“i want to say something to you, miss.” i could see was not at ease,
 so i took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak
 fully; so said, leaving his hand in mine:--
 
“i’m afraid, my deary, that i must have shocked you by all the wicked
 things i’ve been sayin’ about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;
 but i didn’t mean them, and i want ye to remember that when i’m gone. we
 aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don’t
 altogether like to think of it, and we don’t want to feel scart of it;
 an’ that’s why i’ve took to makin’ light of it, so that i’d cheer up my
 own heart bit. but, lord love ye, miss, i ain’t afraid of dyin’, not a
 bit; only i don’t want to die if i can help it. my time must be nigh at
 hand now, for i be aud, and hundred years is too much for any man to
 expect; and i’m so nigh it that the aud man is already whettin’ his
 scythe. ye see, i can’t get out o’ the habit of caffin’ about it all at
 once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. some day soon the angel of
 death will sound his trumpet for me. but don’t ye dooal an’ greet, my
 deary!”--for saw that i was crying--“if should come this very
 night i’d not refuse to answer his call. for life be, after all, only a
 waitin’ for somethin’ else than what we’re doin’; and death be all that
 we can rightly depend on. but i’m content, for it’s comin’ to me, my
 deary, and comin’ quick. it may be comin’ while we be lookin’ and
 wonderin’. maybe it’s in that wind out over the that’s bringin’ with
 it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. look! look!” he
 cried suddenly. “there’s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont
 that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. it’s in the
 air; i feel it comin’. lord, make answer cheerful when my call
 comes!” held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. his mouth
 moved as though were praying. after few minutes’ silence, got
 up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled
 off. it all touched me, and upset very much.
 
i was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his
 arm. stopped to talk with me, as always does, but all the time
 kept looking at strange ship.
 
“i can’t make her out,” said; “she’s russian, by the look of her;
 but she’s knocking about in the queerest way. she doesn’t know her mind
 bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can’t decide whether to
 run up north in the open, or to put in here. look there again! she is
 steered mighty strangely, for she doesn’t mind the hand on the wheel;
 changes about with every puff of wind. we’ll hear more of her before
 this time to-morrow.”

cutting from “the dailygraph,” 8 august
 

(_pasted in mina murray’s journal._)
 
from correspondent.
 
_whitby_.
 
one of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
 experienced here, with results both strange and unique. the weather had
 been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of
 august. saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great
 body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to mulgrave woods,
 robin hood’s bay, rig mill, runswick, staithes, and the various trips in
 the neighbourhood of whitby. the steamers _emma_ and _scarborough_ made
 trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of
 “tripping” both to and from whitby. the day was unusually fine till the
 afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the east cliff
 churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of
 visible to the north and east, called attention to sudden show of
 “mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. the wind was then
 blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical
 language is ranked “no. 2: light breeze.” the coastguard on duty at once
 made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half century has
 kept watch on weather signs from the east cliff, foretold in an emphatic
 manner the coming of sudden storm. the approach of sunset was so very
 beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that
 there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old
 churchyard to enjoy the beauty. before the sun dipped below the black
 mass of kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its
 downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,
 purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and
 there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all
 sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. the
 experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the
 sketches of the “prelude to the great storm” will grace the r. a. and r.
 i. walls in may next. more than one captain made up his mind then and
 there that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the different
 classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.
 the wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there
 was dead calm, sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on
 the approach of thunder, affects persons of sensitive nature. there
 were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,
 which usually “hug” the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but
 few fishing-boats were in sight. the only sail noticeable was foreign
 schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. the
 foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was prolific theme for
 comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal
 her to reduce sail in face of her danger. before the night shut down she
 was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating
 swell of the sea,
 
“as idle as painted ship upon painted ocean.”
 
shortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quite
 oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of sheep
 inland or the barking of dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the
 band on the pier, with its lively french air, was like discord in the
 great harmony of nature’s silence. little after midnight came a
 strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to
 carry strange, faint, hollow booming.
 
then without warning the tempest broke. with rapidity which, at the
 time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,
 the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. the waves rose in
 growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in very few minutes
 the lately glassy was like roaring and devouring monster.
 white-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the
 shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept
 the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier
 of whitby harbour. the wind roared like thunder, and blew with such
 force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,
 or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. it was found necessary
 to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the
 fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. to add to
 the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came
 drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,
 so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of
 imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at were
 touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many
 one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. at times the mist
 cleared, and the for some distance could be seen in the glare of the
 lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals
 of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock
 of the footsteps of the storm.
 
some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of
 absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with
 each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to
 snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there fishing-boat, with
 rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again
 the white wings of storm-tossed sea-bird. on the summit of the east
 cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been
 tried. the officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in
 the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.
 once or twice its service was most effective, as when fishing-boat,
 with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance
 of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the
 piers. as each boat achieved the safety of the port there was shout of
 joy from the mass of people on shore, shout which for moment seemed
 to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.
 
before long the searchlight discovered some distance away schooner
 with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed
 earlier in the evening. the wind had by this time backed to the east,
 and there was shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they
 realized the terrible danger in which she now was. between her and the
 port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time
 to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,
 it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the
 harbour. it was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so
 great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost
 visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such
 speed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere,
 if it was only in hell.” then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than
 any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things
 like grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,
 for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the
 booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder
 than before. the rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour
 mouth across the east pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited
 breathless. the wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant
 of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between
 the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,
 swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and
 gained the safety of the harbour. the searchlight followed her, and a
 shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a
 corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each
 motion of the ship. other form could be seen on deck at all. great
 awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by miracle, had
 found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of dead man! however,
 all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. the
 schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on
 that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many
 storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the east
 cliff, known locally as tate hill pier.
 
there was of course considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on
 the sand heap. every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the
 “top-hammer” came crashing down. but, strangest of all, the very instant
 the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as
 if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow
 on the sand. making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard
 hangs over the laneway to the east pier so steeply that some of the flat
 tombstones--“thruff-steans” or “through-stones,” as they call them in
 the whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff
 has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed
 intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.
 
it so happened that there was one at the moment on tate hill pier, as
 all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were
 out on the heights above. thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern
 side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the
 first to climb on board. the men working the searchlight, after scouring
 the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the
 light on the derelict and kept it there. the coastguard ran aft, and
 when came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at
 once as though under some sudden emotion. this seemed to pique general
 curiosity, and quite number of people began to run. it is good way
 round from the west cliff by the drawbridge to tate hill pier, but your
 correspondent is fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.
 when i arrived, however, i found already assembled on the pier crowd,
 whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. by the
 courtesy of the chief boatman, i was, as your correspondent, permitted
 to climb on deck, and was one of small group who saw the dead seaman
 whilst actually lashed to the wheel.
 
it was wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for
 not often can such sight have been seen. the man was simply fastened
 by his hands, tied one over the other, to spoke of the wheel. between
 the inner hand and the wood was crucifix, the set of beads on which it
 was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by
 the binding cords. the poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but
 the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of
 the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he
 was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. accurate note was made of the
 state of things, and doctor--surgeon j. m. caffyn, of 33, east elliot
 place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making
 examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. in his
 pocket was bottle, carefully corked, empty save for little roll of
 paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. the coastguard said
 the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his
 teeth. the fact that coastguard was the first on board may save some
 complications, later on, in the admiralty court; for coastguards cannot
 claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a
 derelict. already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young
 law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already
 completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the
 statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of
 delegated possession, is held in _dead hand_. it is needless to say
 that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where
 held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as
 noble as that of the young casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to
 await inquest.
 
already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;
 crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over
 the yorkshire wolds. i shall send, in time for your next issue, further
 details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into
 harbour in the storm.
 
_whitby_
 
_9 august._--the sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the
 storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. it
 turns out that the schooner is russian from varna, and is called the
 _demeter_. she is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a
 small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.
 this cargo was consigned to whitby solicitor, mr. s. f. billington, of
 7, the crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took
 possession of the goods consigned to him. the russian consul, too,
 acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and
 paid all harbour dues, etc. nothing is talked about here to-day except
 the strange coincidence; the officials of the board of trade have been
 most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with
 existing regulations. as the matter is to be “nine days’ wonder,” they
 are evidently determined that there shall be cause of after
 complaint. good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which
 landed when the ship struck, and more than few of the members of the
 s. p. c. a., which is very strong in whitby, have tried to befriend the
 animal. to the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;
 it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. it may be that it
 was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still
 hiding in terror. there are some who look with dread on such a
 possibility, lest later on it should in itself become danger, for it
 is evidently fierce brute. early this morning large dog, half-bred
 mastiff belonging to coal merchant close to tate hill pier, was found
 dead in the roadway opposite to its master’s yard. it had been fighting,
 and manifestly had had savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,
 and its belly was slit open as if with savage claw.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--by the kindness of the board of trade inspector, i have been
 permitted to look over the log-book of the _demeter_, which was in order
 up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest
 except as to facts of missing men. the greatest interest, however, is
 with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced
 at the inquest; and more strange narrative than the two between them
 unfold it has not been my lot to come across. as there is motive for
 concealment, i am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a
 rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and
 supercargo. it almost seems as though the captain had been seized with
 some kind of mania before had got well into blue water, and that
 this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. of course my
 statement must be taken _cum grano_, since i am writing from the
 dictation of clerk of the russian consul, who kindly translated for
 me, time being short.
 
log of the “demeter.”

on 6 july we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.
 at noon set sail. east wind, fresh. crew, five hands ... two mates,
 cook, and myself (captain).

on 11 july at dawn entered bosphorus. boarded by turkish customs
 officers. backsheesh. all correct. under way at 4 p. m.

on 12 july through dardanelles. more customs officers and flagboat of
 guarding squadron. backsheesh again. work of officers thorough, but
 quick. want us off soon. at dark passed into archipelago.

on 13 july passed cape matapan. crew dissatisfied about something.
 seemed scared, but would not speak out.
 
* * * * *
 
on 14 july was somewhat anxious about crew. men all steady fellows, who
 sailed with before. mate could not make out what was wrong; they only
 told him there was _something_, and crossed themselves. mate lost temper
 with one of them that day and struck him. expected fierce quarrel, but
 all was quiet.
 
* * * * *
 
on 16 july mate reported in the morning that one of crew, petrofsky, was
 missing. could not account for it. took larboard watch eight bells last
 night; was relieved by abramoff, but did not go to bunk. men more
 downcast than ever. all said they expected something of the kind, but
 would not say more than there was _something_ aboard. mate getting very
 impatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.
 
* * * * *
 
on 17 july, yesterday, one of the men, olgaren, came to my cabin, and in
 an awestruck way confided to that thought there was strange man
 aboard the ship. said that in his watch had been sheltering
 behind the deck-house, as there was rain-storm, when saw tall,
 thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,
 and go along the deck forward, and disappear. followed cautiously,
 but when got to bows found one, and the hatchways were all closed.
 was in panic of superstitious fear, and i am afraid the panic may
 spread. to allay it, i shall to-day search entire ship carefully from
 stem to stern.

later in the day i got together the whole crew, and told them, as they
 evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from
 stem to stern. first mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such
 foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said would engage to keep
 them out of trouble with handspike. i let him take the helm, while the
 rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left
 corner unsearched. as there were only the big wooden boxes, there
 were odd corners where man could hide. men much relieved when
 search over, and went back to work cheerfully. first mate scowled, but
 said nothing.
 
* * * * *
 
_22 july_.--rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with
 sails--no time to be frightened. men seem to have forgotten their dread.
 mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. praised men for work in bad
 weather. passed gibralter and out through straits. all well.
 
* * * * *
 
_24 july_.--there seems some doom over this ship. already hand short,
 and entering on the bay of biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last
 night another man lost--disappeared. like the first, came off his
 watch and was not seen again. men all in panic of fear; sent round
 robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. mate
 angry. fear there will be some trouble, as either or the men will do
 some violence.
 
* * * * *
 
_28 july_.--four days in hell, knocking about in sort of maelstrom,
 and the wind tempest. sleep for any one. men all worn out. hardly
 know how to set watch, since one fit to go on. second mate
 volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch few hours’ sleep.
 wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is
 steadier.
 
* * * * *
 
_29 july_.--another tragedy. had single watch to-night, as crew too
 tired to double. when morning watch came on deck could find one
 except steersman. raised outcry, and all came on deck. thorough search,
 but one found. are now without second mate, and crew in panic. mate
 and i agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.
 
* * * * *
 
_30 july_.--last night. rejoiced we are nearing england. weather fine,
 all sails set. retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling
 that both man of watch and steersman missing. only self and mate and
 two hands left to work ship.
 
* * * * *
 
_1 august_.--two days of fog, and not sail sighted. had hoped when in
 the english channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.
 not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. dare not lower,
 as could not raise them again. we seem to be drifting to some terrible
 doom. mate now more demoralised than either of men. his stronger nature
 seems to have worked inwardly against himself. men are beyond fear,
 working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. they are
 russian, roumanian.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 august, midnight_.--woke up from few minutes’ sleep by hearing cry,
 seemingly outside my port. could see nothing in fog. rushed on deck, and
 ran against mate. tells heard cry and ran, but sign of man on
 watch. one more gone. lord, help us! mate says we must be past straits
 of dover, as in moment of fog lifting saw north foreland, just as
 heard the man cry out. if so we are now off in the north sea, and
 only god can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and god
 seems to have deserted us.
 
* * * * *
 
_3 august_.--at midnight i went to relieve the man at the wheel, and
 when i got to it found one there. the wind was steady, and as we ran
 before it there was yawing. i dared not leave it, so shouted for the
 mate. after few seconds rushed up on deck in his flannels. he
 looked wild-eyed and haggard, and i greatly fear his reason has given
 way. came close to and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my
 ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: “_it_ is here; i know
 it, now. on the watch last night i saw it, like man, tall and thin,
 and ghastly pale. it was in the bows, and looking out. i crept behind
 it, and gave it my knife; but the knife went through it, empty as the
 air.” and as spoke took his knife and drove it savagely into
 space. then went on: “but it is here, and i’ll find it. it is in the
 hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. i’ll unscrew them one by one and
 see. you work the helm.” and, with warning look and his finger on his
 lip, went below. there was springing up choppy wind, and i could
 not leave the helm. i saw him come out on deck again with tool-chest
 and lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. is mad, stark,
 raving mad, and it’s use my trying to stop him. can’t hurt those
 big boxes: they are invoiced as “clay,” and to pull them about is as
 harmless thing as can do. so here i stay, and mind the helm, and
 write these notes. i can only trust in god and wait till the fog clears.
 then, if i can’t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, i shall cut
 down sails and lie by, and signal for help....
 
* * * * *
 
it is nearly all over now. just as i was beginning to hope that the mate
 would come out calmer--for i heard him knocking away at something in the
 hold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway sudden,
 startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he
 came as if shot from gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and
 his face convulsed with fear. “save me! save me!” cried, and then
 looked round on the blanket of fog. his horror turned to despair, and in
 steady voice said: “you had better come too, captain, before it is
 too late. _he_ is there. i know the secret now. the will save me
 from him, and it is all that is left!” before i could say word, or
 move forward to seize him, sprang on the bulwark and deliberately
 threw himself into the sea. i suppose i know the secret too, now. it was
 this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now has
 followed them himself. god help me! how am i to account for all these
 horrors when i get to port? _when_ i get to port! will that ever be?
 
* * * * *
 
_4 august._--still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. i know there is
 sunrise because i am sailor, why else i know not. i dared not go
 below, i dared not leave the helm; so here all night i stayed, and in
 the dimness of the night i saw it--him! god forgive me, but the mate was
 right to jump overboard. it was better to die like man; to die like a
 sailor in blue water man can object. but i am captain, and i must not
 leave my ship. but i shall baffle this fiend or monster, for i shall tie
 my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with
 them i shall tie that which he--it!--dare not touch; and then, come good
 wind or foul, i shall save my soul, and my honour as captain. i am
 growing weaker, and the night is coming on. if can look in the
 face again, i may not have time to act.... if we are wrecked, mayhap
 this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,
 ... well, then all men shall know that i have been true to my trust. god
 and the blessed virgin and the saints help poor ignorant soul trying
 to do his duty....
 
* * * * *
 
of course the verdict was an open one. there is evidence to adduce;
 and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now
 none to say. the folk here hold almost universally that the captain is
 simply hero, and is to be given public funeral. already it is
 arranged that his body is to be taken with train of boats up the esk
 for piece and then brought back to tate hill pier and up the abbey
 steps; for is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. the owners
 of more than hundred boats have already given in their names as
 wishing to follow him to the grave.
 
trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much
 mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, would, i
 believe, be adopted by the town. to-morrow will see the funeral; and so
 will end this one more “mystery of the sea.”
 

_mina murray’s journal._
 
_8 august._--lucy was very restless all night, and i, too, could not
 sleep. the storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the
 chimney-pots, it made shudder. when sharp puff came it seemed to be
 like distant gun. strangely enough, lucy did not wake; but she got up
 twice and dressed herself. fortunately, each time i awoke in time and
 managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. it
 is very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is
 thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,
 disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her
 life.
 
early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see
 if anything had happened in the night. there were very few people about,
 and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,
 grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that
 topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth
 of the harbour--like bullying man going through crowd. somehow i
 felt glad that jonathan was not on the last night, but on land. but,
 oh, is on land or sea? where is he, and how? i am getting fearfully
 anxious about him. if i only knew what to do, and could do anything!
 
* * * * *
 
_10 august._--the funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most
 touching. every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin
 was carried by captains all the way from tate hill pier up to the
 churchyard. lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst
 the cortège of boats went up the river to the viaduct and came down
 again. we had lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.
 the poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on
 it when the time came and saw everything. poor lucy seemed much upset.
 she was restless and uneasy all the time, and i cannot but think that
 her dreaming at night is telling on her. she is quite odd in one thing:
 she will not admit to that there is any cause for restlessness; or if
 there be, she does not understand it herself. there is an additional
 cause in that poor old mr. swales was found dead this morning on our
 seat, his neck being broken. had evidently, as the doctor said,
 fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was look of
 fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. poor
 dear old man! perhaps had seen death with his dying eyes! lucy is so
 sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other
 people do. just now she was quite upset by little thing which i did
 not much heed, though i am myself very fond of animals. one of the men
 who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.
 the dog is always with him. they are both quiet persons, and i never saw
 the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. during the service the dog would
 not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept few
 yards off, barking and howling. its master spoke to it gently, and then
 harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a
 noise. it was in sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs
 bristling out like cat’s tail when puss is on the war-path. finally
 the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then
 took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on
 the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. the moment it touched the
 stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into tremble. it did
 not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was
 in such pitiable state of terror that i tried, though without effect,
 to comfort it. lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to
 touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. i greatly
 fear that she is of too super-sensitive nature to go through the world
 without trouble. she will be dreaming of this to-night, i am sure. the
 whole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by dead
 man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with crucifix and beads; the
 touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all
 afford material for her dreams.
 
i think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so i
 shall take her for long walk by the cliffs to robin hood’s bay and
 back. she ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.
 



chapter viii
 
mina murray’s journal
 

_same day, 11 o’clock p. m._--oh, but i am tired! if it were not that i
 had made my diary duty i should not open it to-night. we had lovely
 walk. lucy, after while, was in gay spirits, owing, i think, to some
 dear cows who came nosing towards us in field close to the lighthouse,
 and frightened the wits out of us. i believe we forgot everything
 except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean
 and give us fresh start. we had capital “severe tea” at robin hood’s
 bay in sweet little old-fashioned inn, with bow-window right over
 the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. i believe we should have
 shocked the “new woman” with our appetites. men are more tolerant, bless
 them! then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,
 and with our hearts full of constant dread of wild bulls. lucy was
 really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.
 the young curate came in, however, and mrs. westenra asked him to stay
 for supper. lucy and i had both fight for it with the dusty miller; i
 know it was hard fight on my part, and i am quite heroic. i think that
 some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up new
 class of curates, who don’t take supper, matter how they may be
 pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. lucy is asleep and
 breathing softly. she has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and
 looks, oh, so sweet. if mr. holmwood fell in love with her seeing her
 only in the drawing-room, i wonder what would say if saw her now.
 some of the “new women” writers will some day start an idea that men and
 women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or
 accepting. but i suppose the new woman won’t condescend in future to
 accept; she will do the proposing herself. and nice job she will make
 of it, too! there’s some consolation in that. i am so happy to-night,
 because dear lucy seems better. i really believe she has turned the
 corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. i should be
 quite happy if i only knew if jonathan.... god bless and keep him.
 
* * * * *
 
_11 august, 3 a. m._--diary again. sleep now, so i may as well write.
 i am too agitated to sleep. we have had such an adventure, such an
 agonising experience. i fell asleep as soon as i had closed my diary....
 suddenly i became broad awake, and sat up, with horrible sense of fear
 upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. the room was dark,
 so i could not see lucy’s bed; i stole across and felt for her. the bed
 was empty. i lit match and found that she was not in the room. the
 door was shut, but not locked, as i had left it. i feared to wake her
 mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some
 clothes and got ready to look for her. as i was leaving the room it
 struck that the clothes she wore might give some clue to her
 dreaming intention. dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.
 dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “thank god,” i said
 to myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.” i ran
 downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. not there! then i looked in
 all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear
 chilling my heart. finally i came to the hall door and found it open. it
 was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. the people
 of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so i feared that
 lucy must have gone out as she was. there was time to think of what
 might happen; vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. i took a
 big, heavy shawl and ran out. the clock was striking one as i was in the
 crescent, and there was not soul in sight. i ran along the north
 terrace, but could see sign of the white figure which i expected. at
 the edge of the west cliff above the pier i looked across the harbour to
 the east cliff, in the hope or fear--i don’t know which--of seeing lucy
 in our favourite seat. there was bright full moon, with heavy black,
 driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into fleeting diorama of
 light and shade as they sailed across. for moment or two i could see
 nothing, as the shadow of cloud obscured st. mary’s church and all
 around it. then as the cloud passed i could see the ruins of the abbey
 coming into view; and as the edge of narrow band of light as sharp as
 sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually
 visible. whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for
 there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a
 half-reclining figure, snowy white. the coming of the cloud was too
 quick for to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost
 immediately; but it seemed to as though something dark stood behind
 the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. what it was,
 whether man or beast, i could not tell; i did not wait to catch another
 glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the
 fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the east
 cliff. the town seemed as dead, for not soul did i see; i rejoiced
 that it was so, for i wanted witness of poor lucy’s condition. the
 time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath
 came laboured as i toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. i must have
 gone fast, and yet it seemed to as if my feet were weighted with
 lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. when i got almost
 to the top i could see the seat and the white figure, for i was now
 close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. there
 was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the
 half-reclining white figure. i called in fright, “lucy! lucy!” and
 something raised head, and from where i was i could see white face
 and red, gleaming eyes. lucy did not answer, and i ran on to the
 entrance of the churchyard. as i entered, the church was between and
 the seat, and for minute or so i lost sight of her. when i came in
 view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly
 that i could see lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back
 of the seat. she was quite alone, and there was not sign of any living
 thing about.
 
when i bent over her i could see that she was still asleep. her lips
 were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in
 long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every
 breath. as i came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the
 collar of her nightdress close around her throat. whilst she did so
 there came little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. i
 flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,
 for i dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,
 unclad as she was. i feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to
 have my hands free that i might help her, i fastened the shawl at her
 throat with big safety-pin; but i must have been clumsy in my anxiety
 and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing
 became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. when i
 had her carefully wrapped up i put my shoes on her feet and then began
 very gently to wake her. at first she did not respond; but gradually she
 became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing
 occasionally. at last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other
 reasons, i wished to get her home at once, i shook her more forcibly,
 till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. she did not seem surprised
 to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.
 lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such time, when her body must
 have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking
 unclad in churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. she
 trembled little, and clung to me; when i told her to come at once with
 home she rose without word, with the obedience of child. as we
 passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and lucy noticed wince. she
 stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but i would not.
 however, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there
 was puddle of water, remaining from the storm, i daubed my feet with
 mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no
 one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.
 
fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting soul. once we saw
 man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along street in front of
 us; but we hid in door till had disappeared up an opening such as
 there are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them in
 scotland. my heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes i thought i
 should faint. i was filled with anxiety about lucy, not only for her
 health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation
 in case the story should get wind. when we got in, and had washed our
 feet, and had said prayer of thankfulness together, i tucked her into
 bed. before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a
 word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. i
 hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her
 mother’s health, and how the knowledge of such thing would fret her,
 and thinking, too, of how such story might become distorted--nay,
 infallibly would--in case it should leak out, i thought it wiser to do
 so. i hope i did right. i have locked the door, and the key is tied to
 my wrist, so perhaps i shall not be again disturbed. lucy is sleeping
 soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....
 
* * * * *
 
_same day, noon._--all goes well. lucy slept till i woke her and seemed
 not to have even changed her side. the adventure of the night does not
 seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she
 looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. i was sorry to
 notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. indeed, it might
 have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. i must have
 pinched up piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are
 two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress
 was drop of blood. when i apologised and was concerned about it, she
 laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. fortunately it
 cannot leave scar, as it is so tiny.
 
* * * * *
 
_same day, night._--we passed happy day. the air was clear, and the
 sun bright, and there was cool breeze. we took our lunch to mulgrave
 woods, mrs. westenra driving by the road and lucy and i walking by the
 cliff-path and joining her at the gate. i felt little sad myself, for
 i could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had
 jonathan been with me. but there! i must only be patient. in the evening
 we strolled in the casino terrace, and heard some good music by spohr
 and mackenzie, and went to bed early. lucy seems more restful than she
 has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. i shall lock the door
 and secure the key the same as before, though i do not expect any
 trouble to-night.
 
* * * * *
 
_12 august._--my expectations were wrong, for twice during the night i
 was wakened by lucy trying to get out. she seemed, even in her sleep, to
 be little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed
 under sort of protest. i woke with the dawn, and heard the birds
 chirping outside of the window. lucy woke, too, and, i was glad to see,
 was even better than on the previous morning. all her old gaiety of
 manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me
 and told all about arthur. i told her how anxious i was about
 jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. well, she succeeded
 somewhat, for, though sympathy can’t alter facts, it can help to make
 them more bearable.
 
* * * * *
 
_13 august._--another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as
 before. again i awoke in the night, and found lucy sitting up in bed,
 still asleep, pointing to the window. i got up quietly, and pulling
 aside the blind, looked out. it was brilliant moonlight, and the soft
 effect of the light over the and sky--merged together in one great,
 silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. between and the moonlight
 flitted great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. once or
 twice it came quite close, but was, i suppose, frightened at seeing me,
 and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. when i came back
 from the window lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.
 she did not stir again all night.
 
* * * * *
 
_14 august._--on the east cliff, reading and writing all day. lucy seems
 to have become as much in love with the spot as i am, and it is hard to
 get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or
 dinner. this afternoon she made funny remark. we were coming home for
 dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the west pier and
 stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. the setting sun, low
 down in the sky, was just dropping behind kettleness; the red light was
 thrown over on the east cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe
 everything in beautiful rosy glow. we were silent for while, and
 suddenly lucy murmured as if to herself:--
 
“his red eyes again! they are just the same.” it was such an odd
 expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. i
 slewed round little, so as to see lucy well without seeming to stare
 at her, and saw that she was in half-dreamy state, with an odd look on
 her face that i could not quite make out; so i said nothing, but
 followed her eyes. she appeared to be looking over at our own seat,
 whereon was dark figure seated alone. i was little startled myself,
 for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like
 burning flames; but second look dispelled the illusion. the red
 sunlight was shining on the windows of st. mary’s church behind our
 seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the
 refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. i
 called lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself
 with start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she
 was thinking of that terrible night up there. we never refer to it; so i
 said nothing, and we went home to dinner. lucy had headache and went
 early to bed. i saw her asleep, and went out for little stroll myself;
 i walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet
 sadness, for i was thinking of jonathan. when coming home--it was then
 bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the
 crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--i threw glance
 up at our window, and saw lucy’s head leaning out. i thought that
 perhaps she was looking out for me, so i opened my handkerchief and
 waved it. she did not notice or make any movement whatever. just then,
 the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell
 on the window. there distinctly was lucy with her head lying up against
 the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. she was fast asleep, and
 by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a
 good-sized bird. i was afraid she might get chill, so i ran upstairs,
 but as i came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast
 asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,
 as though to protect it from cold.
 
i did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; i have taken care that the
 door is locked and the window securely fastened.
 
she looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and
 there is drawn, haggard look under her eyes which i do not like. i
 fear she is fretting about something. i wish i could find out what it
 is.
 
* * * * *
 
_15 august._--rose later than usual. lucy was languid and tired, and
 slept on after we had been called. we had happy surprise at breakfast.
 arthur’s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. lucy
 is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. later on
 in the day she told the cause. she is grieved to lose lucy as her
 very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to
 protect her. poor dear, sweet lady! she confided to that she has got
 her death-warrant. she has not told lucy, and made promise secrecy;
 her doctor told her that within few months, at most, she must die, for
 her heart is weakening. at any time, even now, sudden shock would be
 almost sure to kill her. ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of
 the dreadful night of lucy’s sleep-walking.
 
* * * * *
 
_17 august._--no diary for two whole days. i have not had the heart to
 write. some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.
 news from jonathan, and lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her
 mother’s hours are numbering to close. i do not understand lucy’s
 fading away as she is doing. she eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys
 the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and
 she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night i hear her gasping
 as if for air. i keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at
 night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open
 window. last night i found her leaning out when i woke up, and when i
 tried to wake her i could not; she was in faint. when i managed to
 restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,
 painful struggles for breath. when i asked her how she came to be at the
 window she shook her head and turned away. i trust her feeling ill may
 not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. i looked at her throat
 just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
 they are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the
 edges of them are faintly white. they are like little white dots with
 red centres. unless they heal within day or two, i shall insist on the
 doctor seeing about them.

_mina murray’s journal._
 
_18 august._--i am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the
 churchyard. lucy is ever so much better. last night she slept well all
 night, and did not disturb once. the roses seem coming back already
 to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. if she
 were in any way anæmic i could understand it, but she is not. she is in
 gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. all the morbid reticence
 seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if i
 needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this
 very seat, i found her asleep. as she told she tapped playfully with
 the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--
 
“my poor little feet didn’t make much noise then! i daresay poor old mr.
 swales would have told that it was because i didn’t want to wake up
 geordie.” as she was in such communicative humour, i asked her if she
 had dreamed at all that night. before she answered, that sweet, puckered
 look came into her forehead, which arthur--i call him arthur from her
 habit--says loves; and, indeed, i don’t wonder that does. then she
 went on in half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to
 herself:--
 
“i didn’t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. i only wanted to be
 here in this spot--i don’t know why, for i was afraid of something--i
 don’t know what. i remember, though i suppose i was asleep, passing
 through the streets and over the bridge. fish leaped as i went by, and
 i leaned over to look at it, and i heard lot of dogs howling--the
 whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as
 i went up the steps. then i had vague memory of something long and
 dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very
 sweet and very bitter all around at once; and then i seemed sinking
 into deep green water, and there was singing in my ears, as i have
 heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away
 from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.
 i seem to remember that once the west lighthouse was right under me,
 and then there was sort of agonising feeling, as if i were in an
 earthquake, and i came back and found you shaking my body. i saw you do
 it before i felt you.”
 
then she began to laugh. it seemed little uncanny to me, and i
 listened to her breathlessly. i did not quite like it, and thought it
 better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other
 subjects, and lucy was like her old self again. when we got home the
 fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more
 rosy. her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent very
 happy evening together.
 
* * * * *
 
_19 august._--joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. at last, news of
 jonathan. the dear fellow has been ill; that is why did not write. i
 am not afraid to think it or say it, now that i know. mr. hawkins sent
 on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. i am to leave in the
 morning and go over to jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary,
 and to bring him home. mr. hawkins says it would not be bad thing if
 we were to be married out there. i have cried over the good sister’s
 letter till i can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. it is of
 jonathan, and must be next my heart, for is _in_ my heart. my journey
 is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. i am only taking one change of
 dress; lucy will bring my trunk to london and keep it till i send for
 it, for it may be that ... i must write more; i must keep it to say
 to jonathan, my husband. the letter that has seen and touched must
 comfort till we meet.
 

_letter, sister agatha, hospital of st. joseph and ste. mary,
 buda-pesth, to miss wilhelmina murray._
 
“_12 august._
 
“dear madam,--
 
“i write by desire of mr. jonathan harker, who is himself not strong
 enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to god and st. joseph
 and ste. mary. has been under our care for nearly six weeks,
 suffering from violent brain fever. wishes to convey his love,
 and to say that by this post i write for him to mr. peter hawkins,
 exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that is sorry for his
 delay, and that all of his work is completed. will require some few
 weeks’ rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. he
 wishes to say that has not sufficient money with him, and that he
 would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall
 not be wanting for help.
 
“believe me,
 
“yours, with sympathy and all blessings,
 
“sister agatha.
 
“p. s.--my patient being asleep, i open this to let you know something
 more. has told all about you, and that you are shortly to be his
 wife. all blessings to you both! has had some fearful shock--so says
 our doctor--and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of
 wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and i fear to say of
 what. be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him
 of this kind for long time to come; the traces of such an illness as
 his do not lightly die away. we should have written long ago, but we
 knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one
 could understand. came in the train from klausenburg, and the guard
 was told by the station-master there that rushed into the station
 shouting for ticket for home. seeing from his violent demeanour that
 was english, they gave him ticket for the furthest station on the
 way thither that the train reached.
 
“be assured that is well cared for. has won all hearts by his
 sweetness and gentleness. is truly getting on well, and i have no
 doubt will in few weeks be all himself. but be careful of him for
 safety’s sake. there are, i pray god and st. joseph and ste. mary, many,
 many, happy years for you both.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_19 august._--strange and sudden change in renfield last night. about
 eight o’clock began to get excited and sniff about as dog does when
 setting. the attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest
 in him, encouraged him to talk. is usually respectful to the
 attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, was
 quite haughty. would not condescend to talk with him at all. all he
 would say was:--
 
“i don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the master is at
 hand.”
 
the attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has
 seized him. if so, we must look out for squalls, for strong man with
 homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. the
 combination is dreadful one. at nine o’clock i visited him myself. his
 attitude to was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime
 self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him
 as nothing. it looks like religious mania, and will soon think that
 himself is god. these infinitesimal distinctions between man and man
 are too paltry for an omnipotent being. how these madmen give themselves
 away! the real god taketh heed lest sparrow fall; but the god created
 from human vanity sees difference between an eagle and sparrow. oh,
 if men only knew!
 
for half an hour or more renfield kept getting excited in greater and
 greater degree. i did not pretend to be watching him, but i kept strict
 observation all the same. all at once that shifty look came into his
 eyes which we always see when madman has seized an idea, and with it
 the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to
 know so well. became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his
 bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. i thought i
 would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to
 lead him to talk of his pets, theme which had never failed to excite
 his attention. at first made reply, but at length said testily:--
 
“bother them all! i don’t care pin about them.”
 
“what?” i said. “you don’t mean to tell you don’t care about
 spiders?” (spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling
 up with columns of small figures.) to this answered enigmatically:--
 
“the bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;
 but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes
 that are filled.”
 
would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed
 all the time i remained with him.
 
i am weary to-night and low in spirits. i cannot but think of lucy, and
 how different things might have been. if i don’t sleep at once, chloral,
 the modern morpheus--c_{2}hcl_{3}o. h_{2}o! i must be careful not to let
 it grow into habit. no, i shall take none to-night! i have thought of
 lucy, and i shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. if need be,
 to-night shall be sleepless....
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--glad i made the resolution; gladder that i kept to it. i had
 lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the
 night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that renfield
 had escaped. i threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is
 too dangerous person to be roaming about. those ideas of his might
 work out dangerously with strangers. the attendant was waiting for me.
 said had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his
 bed, when had looked through the observation-trap in the door. his
 attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. he
 ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once
 sent up for me. was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.
 the attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where should
 go than to follow him, as might lose sight of him whilst getting out
 of the building by the door. is bulky man, and couldn’t get through
 the window. i am thin, so, with his aid, i got out, but feet foremost,
 and, as we were only few feet above ground, landed unhurt. the
 attendant told the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a
 straight line, so i ran as quickly as i could. as i got through the belt
 of trees i saw white figure scale the high wall which separates our
 grounds from those of the deserted house.
 
i ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men
 immediately and follow into the grounds of carfax, in case our friend
 might be dangerous. i got ladder myself, and crossing the wall,
 dropped down on the other side. i could see renfield’s figure just
 disappearing behind the angle of the house, so i ran after him. on the
 far side of the house i found him pressed close against the old
 ironbound oak door of the chapel. was talking, apparently to some
 one, but i was afraid to go near enough to hear what was saying, lest
 i might frighten him, and should run off. chasing an errant swarm of
 bees is nothing to following naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping
 is upon him! after few minutes, however, i could see that did not
 take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to
 him--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him
 in. i heard him say:--
 
“i am here to do your bidding, master. i am your slave, and you will
 reward me, for i shall be faithful. i have worshipped you long and afar
 off. now that you are near, i await your commands, and you will not pass
 by, will you, dear master, in your distribution of good things?”
 
_is_ selfish old beggar anyhow. thinks of the loaves and fishes
 even when believes is in real presence. his manias make a
 startling combination. when we closed in on him fought like tiger.
 is immensely strong, for was more like wild beast than man. i
 never saw lunatic in such paroxysm of rage before; and i hope i
 shall not again. it is mercy that we have found out his strength and
 his danger in good time. with strength and determination like his, he
 might have done wild work before was caged. is safe now at any
 rate. jack sheppard himself couldn’t get free from the strait-waistcoat
 that keeps him restrained, and he’s chained to the wall in the padded
 room. his cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are
 more deadly still, for means murder in every turn and movement.
 
just now spoke coherent words for the first time:--
 
“i shall be patient, master. it is coming--coming--coming!”
 
so i took the hint, and came too. i was too excited to sleep, but this
 diary has quieted me, and i feel i shall get some sleep to-night.
 



chapter ix
 

_letter, mina harker to lucy westenra._
 
“_buda-pesth, 24 august._
 
“my dearest lucy,--
 
“i know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we
 parted at the railway station at whitby. well, my dear, i got to hull
 all right, and caught the boat to hamburg, and then the train on here. i
 feel that i can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that i
 knew i was coming to jonathan, and, that as i should have to do some
 nursing, i had better get all the sleep i could.... i found my dear one,
 oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. all the resolution has gone out
 of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which i told you was in his
 face has vanished. is only wreck of himself, and does not
 remember anything that has happened to him for long time past. at
 least, wants to believe so, and i shall never ask. has had some
 terrible shock, and i fear it might tax his poor brain if were to try
 to recall it. sister agatha, who is good creature and born nurse,
 tells that raved of dreadful things whilst was off his head. i
 wanted her to tell what they were; but she would only cross herself,
 and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the
 secrets of god, and that if nurse through her vocation should hear
 them, she should respect her trust. she is sweet, good soul, and the
 next day, when she saw i was troubled, she opened up the subject again,
 and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved
 about, added: ‘i can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about
 anything which has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,
 have cause to be concerned. has not forgotten you or what owes
 to you. his fear was of great and terrible things, which mortal can
 treat of.’ i do believe the dear soul thought i might be jealous lest my
 poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. the idea of
 _my_ being jealous about jonathan! and yet, my dear, let whisper, i
 felt thrill of joy through when i _knew_ that other woman was a
 cause of trouble. i am now sitting by his bedside, where i can see his
 face while sleeps. is waking!...
 
“when woke asked for his coat, as wanted to get something
 from the pocket; i asked sister agatha, and she brought all his things.
 i saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to
 let look at it--for i knew then that i might find some clue to his
 trouble--but i suppose must have seen my wish in my eyes, for sent
 over to the window, saying wanted to be quite alone for moment.
 then called back, and when i came had his hand over the
 note-book, and said to very solemnly:--
 
“‘wilhelmina’--i knew then that was in deadly earnest, for has
 never called by that name since asked to marry him--‘you know,
 dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no
 secret, concealment. i have had great shock, and when i try to
 think of what it is i feel my head spin round, and i do not know if it
 was all real or the dreaming of madman. you know i have had brain
 fever, and that is to be mad. the secret is here, and i do not want to
 know it. i want to take up my life here, with our marriage.’ for, my
 dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are
 complete. ‘are you willing, wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? here is
 the book. take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me
 know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon to go back to
 the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.’ fell
 back exhausted, and i put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. i
 have asked sister agatha to beg the superior to let our wedding be this
 afternoon, and am waiting her reply....
 
* * * * *
 
“she has come and told that the chaplain of the english mission
 church has been sent for. we are to be married in an hour, or as soon
 after as jonathan awakes....
 
* * * * *
 
“lucy, the time has come and gone. i feel very solemn, but very, very
 happy. jonathan woke little after the hour, and all was ready, and he
 sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. answered his ‘i will’ firmly
 and strongly. i could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those
 words seemed to choke me. the dear sisters were so kind. please god, i
 shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities
 i have taken upon me. i must tell you of my wedding present. when the
 chaplain and the sisters had left alone with my husband--oh, lucy, it
 is the first time i have written the words ‘my husband’--left alone
 with my husband, i took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it
 up in white paper, and tied it with little bit of pale blue ribbon
 which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,
 and for my seal i used my wedding ring. then i kissed it and showed it
 to my husband, and told him that i would keep it so, and then it would
 be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each
 other; that i would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake
 or for the sake of some stern duty. then took my hand in his, and oh,
 lucy, it was the first time took _his wife’s_ hand, and said that it
 was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that would go
 through all the past again to win it, if need be. the poor dear meant to
 have said part of the past, but cannot think of time yet, and i
 shall not wonder if at first mixes up not only the month, but the
 year.
 
“well, my dear, what could i say? i could only tell him that i was the
 happiest woman in all the wide world, and that i had nothing to give him
 except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love
 and duty for all the days of my life. and, my dear, when kissed me,
 and drew to him with his poor weak hands, it was like very solemn
 pledge between us....
 
“lucy dear, do you know why i tell you all this? it is not only because
 it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to
 me. it was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from
 the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. i want you to see now,
 and with the eyes of very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that
 in your own married life you too may be all happy as i am. my dear,
 please almighty god, your life may be all it promises: long day of
 sunshine, with harsh wind, forgetting duty, distrust. i must
 not wish you pain, for that can never be; but i do hope you will be
 _always_ as happy as i am _now_. good-bye, my dear. i shall post this at
 once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. i must stop, for jonathan
 is waking--i must attend to my husband!
 
“your ever-loving
 
“mina harker.”
 

_letter, lucy westenra to mina harker._
 
“_whitby, 30 august._
 
“my dearest mina,--
 
“oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own
 home with your husband. i wish you could be coming home soon enough to
 stay with us here. the strong air would soon restore jonathan; it has
 quite restored me. i have an appetite like cormorant, am full of
 life, and sleep well. you will be glad to know that i have quite given
 up walking in my sleep. i think i have not stirred out of my bed for a
 week, that is when i once got into it at night. arthur says i am getting
 fat. by the way, i forgot to tell you that arthur is here. we have such
 walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing
 together; and i love him more than ever. _tells_ that loves me
 more, but i doubt that, for at first told that couldn’t love me
 more than did then. but this is nonsense. there is, calling to me.
 so more just at present from your loving

“p. s.--mother sends her love. she seems better, poor dear.
 “p. p. s.--we are to be married on 28 september.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_20 august._--the case of renfield grows even more interesting. has
 now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.
 for the first week after his attack was perpetually violent. then one
 night, just as the moon rose, grew quiet, and kept murmuring to
 himself: “now i can wait; now i can wait.” the attendant came to tell
 me, so i ran down at once to have look at him. was still in the
 strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone
 from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--i might
 almost say, “cringing”--softness. i was satisfied with his present
 condition, and directed him to be relieved. the attendants hesitated,
 but finally carried out my wishes without protest. it was strange
 thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,
 coming close to me, said in whisper, all the while looking
 furtively at them:--
 
“they think i could hurt you! fancy _me_ hurting _you_! the fools!”
 
it was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated
 even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same i
 do not follow his thought. am i to take it that i have anything in
 common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has
 to gain from some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful
 to him? i must find out later on. to-night will not speak. even the
 offer of kitten or even full-grown cat will not tempt him. will
 only say: “i don’t take any stock in cats. i have more to think of now,
 and i can wait; i can wait.”
 
after while i left him. the attendant tells that was quiet
 until just before dawn, and that then began to get uneasy, and at
 length violent, until at last fell into paroxysm which exhausted
 him so that swooned into sort of coma.
 
* * * * *
 
... three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quiet
 from moonrise to sunrise. i wish i could get some clue to the cause. it
 would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.
 happy thought! we shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. he
 escaped before without our help; to-night shall escape with it. we
 shall give him chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they
 are required....
 
* * * * *
 
_23 august._--“the unexpected always happens.” how well disraeli knew
 life. our bird when found the cage open would not fly, so all our
 subtle arrangements were for nought. at any rate, we have proved one
 thing; that the spells of quietness last reasonable time. we shall in
 future be able to ease his bonds for few hours each day. i have given
 orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,
 when once is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. the poor soul’s
 body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. hark!
 the unexpected again! i am called; the patient has once more escaped.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--another night adventure. renfield artfully waited until the
 attendant was entering the room to inspect. then dashed out past him
 and flew down the passage. i sent word for the attendants to follow.
 again went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him
 in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. when saw me
 became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he
 would have tried to kill me. as we were holding him strange thing
 happened. suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew
 calm. i looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. then i caught
 the patient’s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked
 into the moonlit sky except big bat, which was flapping its silent and
 ghostly way to the west. bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one
 seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had
 some intention of its own. the patient grew calmer every instant, and
 presently said:--
 
“you needn’t tie me; i shall go quietly!” without trouble we came back
 to the house. i feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall
 not forget this night....
 

_lucy westenra’s diary_
 
_hillingham, 24 august._--i must imitate mina, and keep writing things
 down. then we can have long talks when we do meet. i wonder when it will
 be. i wish she were with again, for i feel so unhappy. last night i
 seemed to be dreaming again just as i was at whitby. perhaps it is the
 change of air, or getting home again. it is all dark and horrid to me,
 for i can remember nothing; but i am full of vague fear, and i feel so
 weak and worn out. when arthur came to lunch looked quite grieved
 when saw me, and i hadn’t the spirit to try to be cheerful. i wonder
 if i could sleep in mother’s room to-night. i shall make an excuse and
 try.
 
* * * * *
 
_25 august._--another bad night. mother did not seem to take to my
 proposal. she seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to
 worry me. i tried to keep awake, and succeeded for while; but when the
 clock struck twelve it waked from doze, so i must have been falling
 asleep. there was sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but i
 did not mind it, and as i remember more, i suppose i must then have
 fallen asleep. more bad dreams. i wish i could remember them. this
 morning i am horribly weak. my face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains
 me. it must be something wrong with my lungs, for i don’t seem ever to
 get air enough. i shall try to cheer up when arthur comes, or else i
 know will be miserable to see so.

“my dear jack,--
 
“i want you to do favour. lucy is ill; that is, she has special
 disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. i have
 asked her if there is any cause; i do not dare to ask her mother, for to
 disturb the poor lady’s mind about her daughter in her present state of
 health would be fatal. mrs. westenra has confided to that her doom is
 spoken--disease of the heart--though poor lucy does not know it yet. i
 am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl’s mind. i am
 almost distracted when i think of her; to look at her gives pang. i
 told her i should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at
 first--i know why, old fellow--she finally consented. it will be a
 painful task for you, i know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, and
 i must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. you are to come to lunch at
 hillingham to-morrow, two o’clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in
 mrs. westenra, and after lunch lucy will take an opportunity of being
 alone with you. i shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; i
 am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as i
 can after you have seen her. do not fail!

“_2 september._
 
“my dear old fellow,--
 
“with regard to miss westenra’s health i hasten to let you know at once
 that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady
 that i know of. at the same time, i am not by any means satisfied with
 her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when i saw
 her last. of course you must bear in mind that i did not have full
 opportunity of examination such as i should wish; our very friendship
 makes little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can
 bridge over. i had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to
 draw, in measure, your own conclusions. i shall then say what i have
 done and propose doing.
 
“i found miss westenra in seemingly gay spirits. her mother was present,
 and in few seconds i made up my mind that she was trying all she knew
 to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. i have no
 doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.
 we lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we
 got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness
 amongst us. then mrs. westenra went to lie down, and lucy was left with
 me. we went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,
 for the servants were coming and going. as soon as the door was closed,
 however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into chair
 with great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. when i saw that her
 high spirits had failed, i at once took advantage of her reaction to
 make diagnosis. she said to very sweetly:--
 
“‘i cannot tell you how i loathe talking about myself.’ i reminded her
 that doctor’s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously
 anxious about her. she caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that
 matter in word. ‘tell arthur everything you choose. i do not care for
 myself, but all for him!’ so i am quite free.
 
“i could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but i could not see
 the usual anæmic signs, and by chance i was actually able to test the
 quality of her blood, for in opening window which was stiff cord
 gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. it was a
 slight matter in itself, but it gave an evident chance, and i secured
 few drops of the blood and have analysed them. the qualitative
 analysis gives quite normal condition, and shows, i should infer, in
 itself vigorous state of health. in other physical matters i was quite
 satisfied that there is need for anxiety; but as there must be a
 cause somewhere, i have come to the conclusion that it must be something
 mental. she complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at
 times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but
 regarding which she can remember nothing. she says that as child she
 used to walk in her sleep, and that when in whitby the habit came back,
 and that once she walked out in the night and went to east cliff, where
 miss murray found her; but she assures that of late the habit has not
 returned. i am in doubt, and so have done the best thing i know of; i
 have written to my old friend and master, professor helsing, of
 amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the
 world. i have asked him to come over, and as you told that all things
 were to be at your charge, i have mentioned to him who you are and your
 relations to miss westenra. this, my dear fellow, is in obedience to
 your wishes, for i am only too proud and happy to do anything i can for
 her. helsing would, i know, do anything for for personal
 reason, so, matter on what ground comes, we must accept his
 wishes. is seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because knows
 what is talking about better than any one else. is philosopher
 and metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;
 and has, i believe, an absolutely open mind. this, with an iron
 nerve, temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,
 self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the
 kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the
 noble work that is doing for mankind--work both in theory and
 practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. i
 tell you these facts that you may know why i have such confidence in
 him. i have asked him to come at once. i shall see miss westenra
 to-morrow again. she is to meet at the stores, so that i may not
 alarm her mother by too early repetition of my call.
 
“yours always,
 
“john seward.”

“my good friend,--
 
“when i have received your letter i am already coming to you. by good
 fortune i can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have
 trusted me. were fortune other, then it were bad for those who have
 trusted, for i come to my friend when call to aid those holds
 dear. tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so
 swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other
 friend, too nervous, let slip, you did more for him when wants my
 aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do. but it
 is pleasure added to do for him, your friend; it is to you that i come.
 have then rooms for at the great eastern hotel, so that i may be near
 to hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too
 late on to-morrow, for it is likely that i may have to return here that
 night. but if need be i shall come again in three days, and stay longer
 if it must. till then good-bye, my friend john.
 
“van helsing.”
 

_letter, dr. seward to hon. arthur holmwood._
 
“_3 september._
 
“my dear art,--
 
“van helsing has come and gone. came on with to hillingham, and
 found that, by lucy’s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that
 we were alone with her. helsing made very careful examination of
 the patient. is to report to me, and i shall advise you, for of
 course i was not present all the time. is, i fear, much concerned,
 but says must think. when i told him of our friendship and how you
 trust to in the matter, said: ‘you must tell him all you think.
 tell him what i think, if you can guess it, if you will. nay, i am not
 jesting. this is jest, but life and death, perhaps more.’ i asked
 what meant by that, for was very serious. this was when we had
 come back to town, and was having cup of tea before starting on his
 return to amsterdam. would not give any further clue. you must not
 be angry with me, art, because his very reticence means that all his
 brains are working for her good. will speak plainly enough when the
 time comes, be sure. so i told him i would simply write an account of
 our visit, just as if i were doing descriptive special article for
 _the daily telegraph_. seemed not to notice, but remarked that the
 smuts in london were not quite so bad as they used to be when was a
 student here. i am to get his report to-morrow if can possibly make
 it. in any case i am to have letter.
 
“well, as to the visit. lucy was more cheerful than on the day i first
 saw her, and certainly looked better. she had lost something of the
 ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. she was
 very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him
 feel at ease; though i could see that the poor girl was making hard
 struggle for it. i believe helsing saw it, too, for i saw the quick
 look under his bushy brows that i knew of old. then began to chat of
 all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite
 geniality that i could see poor lucy’s pretense of animation merge into
 reality. then, without any seeming change, brought the conversation
 gently round to his visit, and suavely said:--
 
“‘my dear young miss, i have the so great pleasure because you are so
 much beloved. that is much, my dear, ever were there that which i do not
 see. they told you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a
 ghastly pale. to them i say: “pouf!”’ and snapped his fingers at me
 and went on: ‘but you and i shall show them how wrong they are. how can
 he’--and pointed at with the same look and gesture as that with
 which once pointed out to his class, on, or rather after, a
 particular occasion which never fails to remind of--‘know anything
 of young ladies? has his madmans to play with, and to bring them
 back to happiness, and to those that love them. it is much to do, and,
 oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. but the
 young ladies! has wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell
 themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many
 sorrows and the causes of them. so, my dear, we will send him away to
 smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and i have little talk all
 to ourselves.’ i took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the
 professor came to the window and called in. looked grave, but
 said: ‘i have made careful examination, but there is functional
 cause. with you i agree that there has been much blood lost; it has
 been, but is not. but the conditions of her are in way anæmic. i have
 asked her to send her maid, that i may ask just one or two question,
 that so i may not chance to miss nothing. i know well what she will say.
 and yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. i must go
 back home and think. you must send to the telegram every day; and if
 there be cause i shall come again. the disease--for not to be all well
 is disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me
 too. she charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, i come.’
 
“as i tell you, would not say word more, even when we were alone.
 and so now, art, you know all i know. i shall keep stern watch. i trust
 your poor father is rallying. it must be terrible thing to you, my
 dear old fellow, to be placed in such position between two people who
 are both so dear to you. i know your idea of duty to your father, and
 you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, i shall send you word to
 come at once to lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from
 me.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_4 september._--zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.
 had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. just
 before the stroke of noon began to grow restless. the attendant knew
 the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. fortunately the men came at a
 run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon became so
 violent that it took all their strength to hold him. in about five
 minutes, however, began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank
 into sort of melancholy, in which state has remained up to now. the
 attendant tells that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really
 appalling; i found my hands full when i got in, attending to some of the
 other patients who were frightened by him. indeed, i can quite
 understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though i was
 some distance away. it is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and
 as yet my patient sits in corner brooding, with dull, sullen,
 woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show
 something directly. i cannot quite understand it.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--another change in my patient. at five o’clock i looked in on
 him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as used to be. he
 was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture
 by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of
 padding. when saw me, came over and apologised for his bad
 conduct, and asked in very humble, cringing way to be led back to
 his own room and to have his note-book again. i thought it well to
 humour him: so is back in his room with the window open. has the
 sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a
 harvest of flies. is not now eating them, but putting them into a
 box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find
 spider. i tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any
 clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but would not
 rise. for moment or two looked very sad, and said in sort of
 far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--
 
“all over! all over! has deserted me. hope for now unless i do
 it for myself!” then suddenly turning to in resolute way, said:
 “doctor, won’t you be very good to and let have little more
 sugar? i think it would be good for me.”
 
“and the flies?” i said.
 
“yes! the flies like it, too, and i like the flies; therefore i like
 it.” and there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do
 not argue. i procured him double supply, and left him as happy man
 as, i suppose, any in the world. i wish i could fathom his mind.
 
* * * * *
 
_midnight._--another change in him. i had been to see miss westenra,
 whom i found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our
 own gate looking at the sunset, when once more i heard him yelling. as
 his room is on this side of the house, i could hear it better than in
 the morning. it was shock to to turn from the wonderful smoky
 beauty of sunset over london, with its lurid lights and inky shadows
 and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul
 water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone
 building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart
 to endure it all. i reached him just as the sun was going down, and from
 his window saw the red disc sink. as it sank became less and less
 frenzied; and just as it dipped slid from the hands that held him, an
 inert mass, on the floor. it is wonderful, however, what intellectual
 recuperative power lunatics have, for within few minutes stood up
 quite calmly and looked around him. i signalled to the attendants not to
 hold him, for i was anxious to see what would do. went straight
 over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then took his
 fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then shut
 the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. all this surprised
 me, so i asked him: “are you not going to keep flies any more?”
 
“no,” said he; “i am sick of all that rubbish!” certainly is a
 wonderfully interesting study. i wish i could get some glimpse of his
 mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. stop; there may be clue
 after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon
 and at sunset. can it be that there is malign influence of the sun at
 periods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?
 we shall see.

_letter, dr. seward to hon. arthur holmwood._
 
“_6 september._
 
“my dear art,--
 
“my news to-day is not so good. lucy this morning had gone back bit.
 there is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; mrs.
 westenra was naturally anxious concerning lucy, and has consulted me
 professionally about her. i took advantage of the opportunity, and told
 her that my old master, helsing, the great specialist, was coming to
 stay with me, and that i would put her in his charge conjointly with
 myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a
 shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in lucy’s weak
 condition, might be disastrous to her. we are hedged in with
 difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please god, we shall
 come through them all right. if any need i shall write, so that, if you
 do not hear from me, take it for granted that i am simply waiting for
 news. in haste
 
“yours ever,
 
“john seward.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_7 september._--the first thing helsing said to when we met at
 liverpool street was:--
 
“have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?”
 
“no,” i said. “i waited till i had seen you, as i said in my telegram. i
 wrote him letter simply telling him that you were coming, as miss
 westenra was not so well, and that i should let him know if need be.”
 
“right, my friend,” said, “quite right! better not know as yet;
 perhaps shall never know. i pray so; but if it be needed, then he
 shall know all. and, my good friend john, let caution you. you deal
 with the madmen. all men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch
 as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with god’s madmen,
 too--the rest of the world. you tell not your madmen what you do nor why
 you do it; you tell them not what you think. so you shall keep knowledge
 in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it
 and breed. you and i shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.” he
 touched on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself
 the same way. “i have for myself thoughts at the present. later i shall
 unfold to you.”
 
“why not now?” i asked. “it may do some good; we may arrive at some
 decision.” stopped and looked at me, and said:--
 
“my friend john, when the corn is grown, even before it has
 ripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine
 has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman pull the
 ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,
 and say to you: ‘look! he’s good corn; will make good crop when the
 time comes.’” i did not see the application, and told him so. for reply
 reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as
 used long ago to do at lectures, and said: “the good husbandman tell
 you so then because knows, but not till then. but you do not find the
 good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if grow; that is for
 the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of
 the work of their life. see you now, friend john? i have sown my corn,
 and nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if sprout at all,
 there’s some promise; and i wait till the ear begins to swell.” broke
 off, for evidently saw that i understood. then went on, and very
 gravely:--
 
“you were always careful student, and your case-book was ever more
 full than the rest. you were only student then; now you are master, and
 i trust that good habit have not fail. remember, my friend, that
 knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.
 even if you have not kept the good practise, let tell you that this
 case of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, i say _may be_--of such
 interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the
 beam, as your peoples say. take then good note of it. nothing is too
 small. i counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.
 hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. we
 learn from failure, not from success!”
 
when i described lucy’s symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely
 more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. took with him a
 bag in which were many instruments and drugs, “the ghastly paraphernalia
 of our beneficial trade,” as once called, in one of his lectures, the
 equipment of professor of the healing craft. when we were shown in,
 mrs. westenra met us. she was alarmed, but not nearly so much as i
 expected to find her. nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained
 that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. here, in case
 where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some
 cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her
 daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. it is
 something like the way dame nature gathers round foreign body an
 envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that
 which it would otherwise harm by contact. if this be an ordered
 selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice
 of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have
 knowledge of.
 
i used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down
 rule that she should not be present with lucy or think of her illness
 more than was absolutely required. she assented readily, so readily that
 i saw again the hand of nature fighting for life. helsing and i were
 shown up to lucy’s room. if i was shocked when i saw her yesterday, i
 was horrified when i saw her to-day. she was ghastly, chalkily pale; the
 red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of
 her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or
 hear. helsing’s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged
 till they almost touched over his nose. lucy lay motionless, and did not
 seem to have strength to speak, so for while we were all silent. then
 helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. the
 instant we had closed the door stepped quickly along the passage to
 the next door, which was open. then pulled quickly in with him and
 closed the door. “my god!” said; “this is dreadful. there is time
 to be lost. she will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart’s
 action as it should be. there must be transfusion of blood at once. is
 it you or me?”
 
“i am younger and stronger, professor. it must be me.”
 
“then get ready at once. i will bring up my bag. i am prepared.”
 
i went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was knock at
 the hall-door. when we reached the hall the maid had just opened the
 door, and arthur was stepping quickly in. rushed up to me, saying in
 an eager whisper:--
 
“jack, i was so anxious. i read between the lines of your letter, and
 have been in an agony. the dad was better, so i ran down here to see for
 myself. is not that gentleman dr. helsing? i am so thankful to you,
 sir, for coming.” when first the professor’s eye had lit upon him had
 been angry at his interruption at such time; but now, as took in
 his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which
 seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. without pause said to
 him gravely as held out his hand:--
 
“sir, you have come in time. you are the lover of our dear miss. she is
 bad, very, very bad. nay, my child, do not go like that.” for he
 suddenly grew pale and sat down in chair almost fainting. “you are to
 help her. you can do more than any that live, and your courage is your
 best help.”
 
“what can i do?” asked arthur hoarsely. “tell me, and i shall do it. my
 life is hers, and i would give the last drop of blood in my body for
 her.” the professor has strongly humorous side, and i could from old
 knowledge detect trace of its origin in his answer:--
 
“my young sir, i do not ask so much as that--not the last!”
 
“what shall i do?” there was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril
 quivered with intent. helsing slapped him on the shoulder. “come!”
 said. “you are man, and it is man we want. you are better than
 me, better than my friend john.” arthur looked bewildered, and the
 professor went on by explaining in kindly way:--
 
“young miss is bad, very bad. she wants blood, and blood she must have
 or die. my friend john and i have consulted; and we are about to perform
 what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to
 the empty veins which pine for him. john was to give his blood, as is
 the more young and strong than me”--here arthur took my hand and wrung
 it hard in silence--“but, now you are here, you are more good than us,
 old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. our nerves are not
 so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!” arthur turned to him
 and said:--
 
“if you only knew how gladly i would die for her you would
 understand----”
 
stopped, with sort of choke in his voice.
 
“good boy!” said helsing. “in the not-so-far-off you will be happy
 that you have done all for her you love. come now and be silent. you
 shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you
 must leave at my sign. say word to madame; you know how it is with
 her! there must be shock; any knowledge of this would be one. come!”
 
we all went up to lucy’s room. arthur by direction remained outside.
 lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. she was not
 asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. her eyes spoke
 to us; that was all. helsing took some things from his bag and laid
 them on little table out of sight. then mixed narcotic, and
 coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--
 
“now, little miss, here is your medicine. drink it off, like good
 child. see, i lift you so that to swallow is easy. yes.” she had made
 the effort with success.
 
it astonished how long the drug took to act. this, in fact, marked
 the extent of her weakness. the time seemed endless until sleep began to
 flicker in her eyelids. at last, however, the narcotic began to manifest
 its potency; and she fell into deep sleep. when the professor was
 satisfied called arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his
 coat. then added: “you may take that one little kiss whiles i bring
 over the table. friend john, help to me!” so neither of us looked whilst
 bent over her.
 
helsing turning to me, said:
 
“he is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not
 defibrinate it.”
 
then with swiftness, but with absolute method, helsing performed the
 operation. as the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come
 back to poor lucy’s cheeks, and through arthur’s growing pallor the joy
 of his face seemed absolutely to shine. after bit i began to grow
 anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on arthur, strong man as he
 was. it gave an idea of what terrible strain lucy’s system must
 have undergone that what weakened arthur only partially restored her.
 but the professor’s face was set, and stood watch in hand and with
 his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on arthur. i could hear my own
 heart beat. presently said in soft voice: “do not stir an instant.
 it is enough. you attend him; i will look to her.” when all was over i
 could see how much arthur was weakened. i dressed the wound and took his
 arm to bring him away, when helsing spoke without turning round--the
 man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--
 
“the brave lover, i think, deserve another kiss, which shall have
 presently.” and as had now finished his operation, adjusted the
 pillow to the patient’s head. as did so the narrow black velvet band
 which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old
 diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged little up,
 and showed red mark on her throat. arthur did not notice it, but i
 could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of helsing’s
 ways of betraying emotion. said nothing at the moment, but turned to
 me, saying: “now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port
 wine, and let him lie down while. must then go home and rest, sleep
 much and eat much, that may be recruited of what has so given to
 his love. must not stay here. hold! moment. i may take it, sir,
 that you are anxious of result. then bring it with you that in all ways
 the operation is successful. you have saved her life this time, and you
 can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. i shall tell
 her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you
 have done. good-bye.”
 
when arthur had gone i went back to the room. lucy was sleeping gently,
 but her breathing was stronger; i could see the counterpane move as her
 breast heaved. by the bedside sat helsing, looking at her intently.
 the velvet band again covered the red mark. i asked the professor in a
 whisper:--
 
“what do you make of that mark on her throat?”
 
“what do you make of it?”
 
“i have not examined it yet,” i answered, and then and there proceeded
 to loose the band. just over the external jugular vein there were two
 punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. there was sign of
 disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some
 trituration. it at once occurred to that this wound, or whatever it
 was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but i abandoned
 the idea as soon as formed, for such thing could not be. the whole bed
 would have been drenched to scarlet with the blood which the girl must
 have lost to leave such pallor as she had before the transfusion.
 
“well?” said helsing.
 
“well,” said i, “i can make nothing of it.” the professor stood up. “i
 must go back to amsterdam to-night,” said. “there are books and
 things there which i want. you must remain here all the night, and you
 must not let your sight pass from her.”
 
“shall i have nurse?” i asked.
 
“we are the best nurses, you and i. you keep watch all night; see that
 she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. you must not sleep all
 the night. later on we can sleep, you and i. i shall be back as soon as
 possible. and then we may begin.”
 
“may begin?” i said. “what on earth do you mean?”
 
“we shall see!” answered, as hurried out. came back moment
 later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held
 up:--
 
“remember, she is your charge. if you leave her, and harm befall, you
 shall not sleep easy hereafter!”
 

_dr. seward’s diary--continued._
 
_8 september._--i sat up all night with lucy. the opiate worked itself
 off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked different being
 from what she had been before the operation. her spirits even were good,
 and she was full of happy vivacity, but i could see evidences of the
 absolute prostration which she had undergone. when i told mrs. westenra
 that dr. helsing had directed that i should sit up with her she
 almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s renewed
 strength and excellent spirits. i was firm, however, and made
 preparations for my long vigil. when her maid had prepared her for the
 night i came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took seat by
 the bedside. she did not in any way make objection, but looked at me
 gratefully whenever i caught her eye. after long spell she seemed
 sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together
 and shook it off. this was repeated several times, with greater effort
 and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. it was apparent that she
 did not want to sleep, so i tackled the subject at once:--
 
“you do not want to go to sleep?”
 
“no; i am afraid.”
 
“afraid to go to sleep! why so? it is the boon we all crave for.”
 
“ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you presage of horror!”
 
“a presage of horror! what on earth do you mean?”
 
“i don’t know; oh, i don’t know. and that is what is so terrible. all
 this weakness comes to in sleep; until i dread the very thought.”
 
“but, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. i am here watching you, and
 i can promise that nothing will happen.”
 
“ah, i can trust you!” i seized the opportunity, and said: “i promise
 you that if i see any evidence of bad dreams i will wake you at once.”
 
“you will? oh, will you really? how good you are to me. then i will
 sleep!” and almost at the word she gave deep sigh of relief, and sank
 back, asleep.
 
all night long i watched by her. she never stirred, but slept on and on
 in deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. her lips were
 slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a
 pendulum. there was smile on her face, and it was evident that bad
 dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.
 
in the early morning her maid came, and i left her in her care and took
 myself back home, for i was anxious about many things. i sent short
 wire to helsing and to arthur, telling them of the excellent result
 of the operation. my own work, with its manifold arrears, took all
 day to clear off; it was dark when i was able to inquire about my
 zoöphagous patient. the report was good; had been quite quiet for the
 past day and night. telegram came from helsing at amsterdam whilst
 i was at dinner, suggesting that i should be at hillingham to-night, as
 it might be well to be at hand, and stating that was leaving by the
 night mail and would join early in the morning.
 
* * * * *
 
_9 september_.--i was pretty tired and worn out when i got to
 hillingham. for two nights i had hardly had wink of sleep, and my
 brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral
 exhaustion. lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. when she shook hands
 with she looked sharply in my face and said:--
 
“no sitting up to-night for you. you are worn out. i am quite well
 again; indeed, i am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is i who
 will sit up with you.” i would not argue the point, but went and had my
 supper. lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, i
 made an excellent meal, and had couple of glasses of the more than
 excellent port. then lucy took upstairs, and showed room next
 her own, where cozy fire was burning. “now,” she said, “you must stay
 here. i shall leave this door open and my door too. you can lie on the
 sofa for i know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to
 bed whilst there is patient above the horizon. if i want anything i
 shall call out, and you can come to at once.” i could not but
 acquiesce, for i was “dog-tired,” and could not have sat up had i tried.
 so, on her renewing her promise to call if she should want anything,
 i lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.
 

_lucy westenra’s diary._
 
_9 september._--i feel so happy to-night. i have been so miserably weak,
 that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after
 long spell of east wind out of steel sky. somehow arthur feels very,
 very close to me. i seem to feel his presence warm about me. i suppose
 it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner
 eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give love
 rein, and in thought and feeling can wander where wills. i know
 where my thoughts are. if arthur only knew! my dear, my dear, your ears
 must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. oh, the blissful rest of
 last night! how i slept, with that dear, good dr. seward watching me.
 and to-night i shall not fear to sleep, since is close at hand and
 within call. thank everybody for being so good to me! thank god!
 good-night, arthur.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_10 september._--i was conscious of the professor’s hand on my head, and
 started awake all in second. that is one of the things that we learn
 in an asylum, at any rate.
 
“and how is our patient?”
 
“well, when i left her, or rather when she left me,” i answered.
 
“come, let us see,” said. and together we went into the room.
 
the blind was down, and i went over to raise it gently, whilst van
 helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.
 
as i raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, i
 heard the professor’s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a
 deadly fear shot through my heart. as i passed over moved back, and
 his exclamation of horror, “gott in himmel!” needed enforcement from
 his agonised face. raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his
 iron face was drawn and ashen white. i felt my knees begin to tremble.
 
there on the bed, seemingly in swoon, lay poor lucy, more horribly
 white and wan-looking than ever. even the lips were white, and the gums
 seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a
 corpse after prolonged illness. helsing raised his foot to stamp
 in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit
 stood to him, and put it down again softly. “quick!” said. “bring
 the brandy.” i flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.
 wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and
 wrist and heart. felt her heart, and after few moments of agonising
 suspense said:--
 
“it is not too late. it beats, though but feebly. all our work is
 undone; we must begin again. there is young arthur here now; i have
 to call on you yourself this time, friend john.” as spoke, was
 dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; i
 had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. there was no
 possibility of an opiate just at present, and need of one; and so,
 without moment’s delay, we began the operation. after time--it did
 not seem short time either, for the draining away of one’s blood, no
 matter how willingly it be given, is terrible feeling--van helsing
 held up warning finger. “do not stir,” said, “but i fear that with
 growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much
 danger. but i shall precaution take. i shall give hypodermic injection
 of morphia.” proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his
 intent. the effect on lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge
 subtly into the narcotic sleep. it was with feeling of personal pride
 that i could see faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid
 cheeks and lips. man knows, till experiences it, what it is to
 feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman loves.
 
the professor watched critically. “that will do,” said. “already?”
 i remonstrated. “you took great deal more from art.” to which he
 smiled sad sort of smile as replied:--
 
“he is her lover, her _fiancé_. you have work, much work, to do for her
 and for others; and the present will suffice.”
 
when we stopped the operation, attended to lucy, whilst i applied
 digital pressure to my own incision. i laid down, whilst i waited his
 leisure to attend to me, for i felt faint and little sick. by-and-by
 bound up my wound, and sent downstairs to get glass of wine for
 myself. as i was leaving the room, came after me, and half
 whispered:--
 
“mind, nothing must be said of this. if our young lover should turn up
 unexpected, as before, word to him. it would at once frighten him and
 enjealous him, too. there must be none. so!”
 
when i came back looked at carefully, and then said:--
 
“you are not much the worse. go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and
 rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.”
 
i followed out his orders, for i knew how right and wise they were. i
 had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. i
 felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at
 what had occurred. i fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over
 and over again how lucy had made such retrograde movement, and how
 she could have been drained of so much blood with sign anywhere to
 show for it. i think i must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,
 sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little
 punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their
 edges--tiny though they were.
 
lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and
 strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. when helsing
 had seen her, went out for walk, leaving in charge, with strict
 injunctions that i was not to leave her for moment. i could hear his
 voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.
 
lucy chatted with freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything
 had happened. i tried to keep her amused and interested. when her mother
 came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but
 said to gratefully:--
 
“we owe you so much, dr. seward, for all you have done, but you really
 must now take care not to overwork yourself. you are looking pale
 yourself. you want wife to nurse and look after you bit; that you
 do!” as she spoke, lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,
 for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted
 drain to the head. the reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned
 imploring eyes on me. i smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my
 lips; with sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.
 
helsing returned in couple of hours, and presently said to me:
 “now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. make yourself strong. i
 stay here to-night, and i shall sit up with little miss myself. you and
 i must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. i have grave
 reasons. no, do not ask them; think what you will. do not fear to think
 even the most not-probable. good-night.”
 
in the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of
 them might not sit up with miss lucy. they implored to let them; and
 when i said it was dr. helsing’s wish that either or i should sit
 up, they asked quite piteously to intercede with the “foreign
 gentleman.” i was much touched by their kindness. perhaps it is because
 i am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on lucy’s account, that
 their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have i seen
 similar instances of woman’s kindness. i got back here in time for a
 late dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting
 for sleep. it is coming.
 
* * * * *
 
_11 september._--this afternoon i went over to hillingham. found van
 helsing in excellent spirits, and lucy much better. shortly after i had
 arrived, big parcel from abroad came for the professor. opened it
 with much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed great bundle of
 white flowers.
 
“these are for you, miss lucy,” said.
 
“for me? oh, dr. helsing!”
 
“yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. these are medicines.” here
 lucy made wry face. “nay, but they are not to take in decoction or
 in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or i shall
 point out to my friend arthur what woes may have to endure in seeing
 so much beauty that so loves so much distort. aha, my pretty miss,
 that bring the so nice nose all straight again. this is medicinal, but
 you do not know how. i put him in your window, i make pretty wreath, and
 hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. oh yes! they, like the
 lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. it smell so like the waters
 of lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the conquistadores sought
 for in the floridas, and find him all too late.”
 
whilst was speaking, lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling
 them. now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and
 half-disgust:--
 
“oh, professor, i believe you are only putting up joke on me. why,
 these flowers are only common garlic.”
 
to my surprise, helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his
 iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--
 
“no trifling with me! i never jest! there is grim purpose in all i do;
 and i warn you that you do not thwart me. take care, for the sake of
 others if not for your own.” then seeing poor lucy scared, as she might
 well be, went on more gently: “oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear
 me. i only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so
 common flowers. see, i place them myself in your room. i make myself the
 wreath that you are to wear. but hush! telling to others that make so
 inquisitive questions. we must obey, and silence is part of obedience;
 and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait
 for you. now sit still awhile. come with me, friend john, and you shall
 help deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from haarlem,
 where my friend vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.
 i had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.”
 
we went into the room, taking the flowers with us. the professor’s
 actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia
 that i ever heard of. first fastened up the windows and latched them
 securely; next, taking handful of the flowers, rubbed them all over
 the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get
 in would be laden with the garlic smell. then with the wisp rubbed
 all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round
 the fireplace in the same way. it all seemed grotesque to me, and
 presently i said:--
 
“well, professor, i know you always have reason for what you do, but
 this certainly puzzles me. it is well we have sceptic here, or he
 would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.”
 
“perhaps i am!” answered quietly as began to make the wreath which
 lucy was to wear round her neck.
 
we then waited whilst lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she
 was in bed came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her
 neck. the last words said to her were:--
 
“take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do
 not to-night open the window or the door.”
 
“i promise,” said lucy, “and thank you both thousand times for all
 your kindness to me! oh, what have i done to be blessed with such
 friends?”
 
as we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, helsing said:--
 
“to-night i can sleep in peace, and sleep i want--two nights of travel,
 much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,
 and night to sit up, without to wink. to-morrow in the morning early
 you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much
 more strong for my ‘spell’ which i have work. ho! ho!”
 
seemed so confident that i, remembering my own confidence two nights
 before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. it must
 have been my weakness that made hesitate to tell it to my friend, but
 i felt it all the more, like unshed tears.
 



chapter xi
 
_lucy westenra’s diary._
 

_12 september._--how good they all are to me. i quite love that dear dr.
 helsing. i wonder why was so anxious about these flowers. he
 positively frightened me, was so fierce. and yet must have been
 right, for i feel comfort from them already. somehow, i do not dread
 being alone to-night, and i can go to sleep without fear. i shall not
 mind any flapping outside the window. oh, the terrible struggle that i
 have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,
 or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has
 for me! how blessed are some people, whose lives have fears, no
 dreads; to whom sleep is blessing that comes nightly, and brings
 nothing but sweet dreams. well, here i am to-night, hoping for sleep,
 and lying like ophelia in the play, with “virgin crants and maiden
 strewments.” i never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!
 there is peace in its smell; i feel sleep coming already. good-night,
 everybody.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_13 september._--called at the berkeley and found helsing, as usual,
 up to time. the carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. the
 professor took his bag, which always brings with him now.
 
let all be put down exactly. helsing and i arrived at hillingham at
 eight o’clock. it was lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the
 fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’s
 annual work. the leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,
 but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. when we entered we met
 mrs. westenra coming out of the morning room. she is always an early
 riser. she greeted us warmly and said:--
 
“you will be glad to know that lucy is better. the dear child is still
 asleep. i looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest i
 should disturb her.” the professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. he
 rubbed his hands together, and said:--
 
“aha! i thought i had diagnosed the case. my treatment is working,” to
 which she answered:--
 
“you must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. lucy’s state this
 morning is due in part to me.”
 
“how you do mean, ma’am?” asked the professor.
 
“well, i was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into
 her room. she was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did
 not wake her. but the room was awfully stuffy. there were lot of those
 horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually
 bunch of them round her neck. i feared that the heavy odour would be
 too much for the dear child in her weak state, so i took them all away
 and opened bit of the window to let in little fresh air. you will be
 pleased with her, i am sure.”
 
she moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. as
 she had spoken, i watched the professor’s face, and saw it turn ashen
 grey. had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady
 was present, for knew her state and how mischievous shock would be;
 actually smiled on her as held open the door for her to pass into
 her room. but the instant she had disappeared pulled me, suddenly and
 forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.
 
then, for the first time in my life, i saw helsing break down. he
 raised his hands over his head in sort of mute despair, and then beat
 his palms together in helpless way; finally sat down on chair,
 and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs
 that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. then raised
 his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. “god! god!
 god!” said. “what have we done, what has this poor thing done, that
 we are so sore beset? is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the
 pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? this poor
 mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such
 thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we
 must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. oh, how we are
 beset! how are all the powers of the devils against us!” suddenly he
 jumped to his feet. “come,” said, “come, we must see and act. devils
 or devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him
 all the same.” went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we
 went up to lucy’s room.
 
once again i drew up the blind, whilst helsing went towards the bed.
 this time did not start as looked on the poor face with the same
 awful, waxen pallor as before. wore look of stern sadness and
 infinite pity.
 
“as i expected,” murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which
 meant so much. without word went and locked the door, and then
 began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another
 operation of transfusion of blood. i had long ago recognised the
 necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but stopped with a
 warning hand. “no!” said. “to-day you must operate. i shall provide.
 you are weakened already.” as spoke took off his coat and rolled
 up his shirt-sleeve.
 
again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to
 the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. this time i
 watched whilst helsing recruited himself and rested.
 
presently took an opportunity of telling mrs. westenra that she must
 not remove anything from lucy’s room without consulting him; that the
 flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour
 was part of the system of cure. then took over the care of the case
 himself, saying that would watch this night and the next and would
 send word when to come.
 
after another hour lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and
 seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.
 
what does it all mean? i am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life
 amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.
 

_lucy westenra’s diary._
 
_17 september._--four days and nights of peace. i am getting so strong
 again that i hardly know myself. it is as if i had passed through some
 long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and
 feel the fresh air of the morning around me. i have dim
 half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness
 in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress
 more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to
 life as diver coming up through great press of water. since,
 however, dr. helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems
 to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten out of my
 wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed
 so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from i know not where and
 commanded to do i know not what--have all ceased. i go to bed now
 without any fear of sleep. i do not even try to keep awake. i have grown
 quite fond of the garlic, and boxful arrives for every day from
 haarlem. to-night dr. helsing is going away, as has to be for a
 day in amsterdam. but i need not be watched; i am well enough to be left
 alone. thank god for mother’s sake, and dear arthur’s, and for all our
 friends who have been so kind! i shall not even feel the change, for
 last night dr. helsing slept in his chair lot of the time. i found
 him asleep twice when i awoke; but i did not fear to go to sleep again,
 although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against
 the window-panes.
 

_“the pall mall gazette,” 18 september._
 
the escaped wolf.
 
perilous adventure of our interviewer.
 
_interview with the keeper in the zoölogical gardens._
 
after many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using
 the words “pall mall gazette” as sort of talisman, i managed to find
 the keeper of the section of the zoölogical gardens in which the wolf
 department is included. thomas bilder lives in one of the cottages in
 the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to
 his tea when i found him. thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,
 elderly, and without children, and if the specimen i enjoyed of their
 hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty
 comfortable. the keeper would not enter on what called “business”
 until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. then when the
 table was cleared, and had lit his pipe, said:--
 
“now, sir, you can go on and arsk what you want. you’ll excoose me
 refoosin’ to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. i gives the
 wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore
 i begins to arsk them questions.”
 
“how do you mean, ask them questions?” i queried, wishful to get him
 into talkative humour.
 
“’ittin’ of them over the ’ead with pole is one way; scratchin’ of
 their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants bit of show-orf
 to their gals. i don’t so much mind the fust--the ’ittin’ with pole
 afore i chucks in their dinner; but i waits till they’ve ’ad their
 sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore i tries on with the
 ear-scratchin’. mind you,” added philosophically, “there’s deal of
 the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. here’s you a-comin’ and
 arskin’ of questions about my business, and i that grumpy-like that
 only for your bloomin’ ’arf-quid i’d ’a’ seen you blowed fust ’fore i’d
 answer. not even when you arsked sarcastic-like if i’d like you to
 arsk the superintendent if you might arsk questions. without offence
 did i tell yer to go to ’ell?”
 
“you did.”
 
“an’ when you said you’d report for usin’ of obscene language that
 was ’ittin’ over the ’ead; but the ’arf-quid made that all right. i
 weren’t a-goin’ to fight, so i waited for the food, and did with my ’owl
 as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. but, lor’ love yer ’art, now
 that the old ’ooman has stuck chunk of her tea-cake in me, an’ rinsed
 out with her bloomin’ old teapot, and i’ve lit hup, you may scratch
 my ears for all you’re worth, and won’t git even growl out of me.
 drive along with your questions. i know what yer a-comin’ at, that ’ere
 escaped wolf.”
 
“exactly. i want you to give your view of it. just tell how it
 happened; and when i know the facts i’ll get you to say what you
 consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will
 end.”
 
“all right, guv’nor. this ’ere is about the ’ole story. that ’ere wolf
 what we called bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from
 norway to jamrach’s, which we bought off him four years ago. was a
 nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave trouble to talk of. i’m more
 surprised at ’im for wantin’ to get out nor any other animile in the
 place. but, there, you can’t trust wolves more nor women.”
 
“don’t you mind him, sir!” broke in mrs. tom, with cheery laugh. “’e’s
 got mindin’ the animiles so long that blest if ain’t like old wolf
 ’isself! but there ain’t ’arm in ’im.”
 
“well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin’ yesterday when i first
 hear my disturbance. i was makin’ up litter in the monkey-house for a
 young puma which is ill; but when i heard the yelpin’ and ’owlin’ i kem
 away straight. there was bersicker a-tearin’ like mad thing at the
 bars as if wanted to get out. there wasn’t much people about that
 day, and close at hand was only one man, tall, thin chap, with ’ook
 nose and pointed beard, with few white hairs runnin’ through it. he
 had ’ard, cold look and red eyes, and i took sort of mislike to him,
 for it seemed as if it was ’im as they was hirritated at. ’ad white
 kid gloves on ’is ’ands, and pointed out the animiles to and says:
 ‘keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.’
 
“‘maybe it’s you,’ says i, for i did not like the airs as give
 ’isself. didn’t git angry, as i ’oped would, but smiled kind
 of insolent smile, with mouth full of white, sharp teeth. ‘oh no, they
 wouldn’t like me,’ ’e says.
 
“‘ow yes, they would,’ says i, a-imitatin’ of him. ‘they always likes a
 bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you ’as a
 bagful.’
 
“well, it was odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin’ they
 lay down, and when i went over to bersicker let stroke his ears
 same as ever. that there man kem over, and blessed but if didn’t put
 in his hand and stroke the old wolf’s ears too!
 
“‘tyke care,’ says i. ‘bersicker is quick.’
 
“‘never mind,’ says. ‘i’m used to ’em!’
 
“‘are you in the business yourself?’ i says, tyking off my ’at, for a
 man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is good friend to keepers.
 
“‘no,’ says he, ‘not exactly in the business, but i ’ave made pets of
 several.’ and with that lifts his ’at as perlite as lord, and walks
 away. old bersicker kep’ a-lookin’ arter ’im till ’e was out of sight,
 and then went and lay down in corner and wouldn’t come hout the ’ole
 hevening. well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves
 here all began a-’owling. there warn’t nothing for them to ’owl at.
 there warn’t one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin’ a
 dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the park road. once or twice
 i went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the ’owling
 stopped. just before twelve o’clock i just took look round afore
 turnin’ in, an’, bust me, but when i kem opposite to old bersicker’s
 cage i see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. and
 that’s all i know for certing.”
 
“did any one else see anything?”
 
“one of our gard’ners was a-comin’ ’ome about that time from ’armony,
 when sees big grey dog comin’ out through the garding ’edges. at
 least, so says, but i don’t give much for it myself, for if did ’e
 never said word about it to his missis when ’e got ’ome, and it was
 only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all
 night-a-huntin’ of the park for bersicker, that remembered seein’
 anything. my own belief was that the ’armony ’ad got into his ’ead.”
 
“now, mr. bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the
 wolf?”
 
“well, sir,” said, with suspicious sort of modesty, “i think i can;
 but i don’t know as ’ow you’d be satisfied with the theory.”
 
“certainly i shall. if man like you, who knows the animals from
 experience, can’t hazard good guess at any rate, who is even to try?”
 
“well then, sir, i accounts for it this way; it seems to that ’ere
 wolf escaped--simply because wanted to get out.”
 
from the hearty way that both thomas and his wife laughed at the joke i
 could see that it had done service before, and that the whole
 explanation was simply an elaborate sell. i couldn’t cope in badinage
 with the worthy thomas, but i thought i knew surer way to his heart,
 so i said:--
 
“now, mr. bilder, we’ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,
 and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you’ve told me
 what you think will happen.”
 
“right y’are, sir,” said briskly. “ye’ll excoose me, i know, for
 a-chaffin’ of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much
 as telling to go on.”
 
“well, i never!” said the old lady.
 
“my opinion is this: that ’ere wolf is a-’idin’ of, somewheres. the
 gard’ner wot didn’t remember said was a-gallopin’ northward faster
 than horse could go; but i don’t believe him, for, yer see, sir,
 wolves don’t gallop more nor dogs does, they not bein’ built that
 way. wolves is fine things in storybook, and i dessay when they gets
 in packs and does be chivyin’ somethin’ that’s more afeared than they is
 they can make devil of noise and chop it up, whatever it is. but,
 lor’ bless you, in real life wolf is only low creature, not half so
 clever or bold as good dog; and not half quarter so much fight in
 ’im. this one ain’t been used to fightin’ or even to providin’ for
 hisself, and more like he’s somewhere round the park a-’idin’ an’
 a-shiverin’ of, and, if thinks at all, wonderin’ where is to get
 his breakfast from; or maybe he’s got down some area and is in a
 coal-cellar. my eye, won’t some cook get rum start when she sees his
 green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! if can’t get food he’s
 bound to look for it, and mayhap may chance to light on butcher’s
 shop in time. if doesn’t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin’ orf with
 soldier, leavin’ of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then i
 shouldn’t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. that’s
 all.”
 
i was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up
 against the window, and mr. bilder’s face doubled its natural length
 with surprise.
 
“god bless me!” said. “if there ain’t old bersicker come back by
 ’isself!”
 
went to the door and opened it; most unnecessary proceeding it
 seemed to me. i have always thought that wild animal never looks so
 well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a
 personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.
 
after all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither bilder nor
 his wife thought any more of the wolf than i should of dog. the animal
 itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all
 picture-wolves--red riding hood’s quondam friend, whilst moving her
 confidence in masquerade.
 
the whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. the
 wicked wolf that for half day had paralysed london and set all the
 children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in sort of
 penitent mood, and was received and petted like sort of vulpine
 prodigal son. old bilder examined him all over with most tender
 solicitude, and when had finished with his penitent said:--
 
“there, i knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;
 didn’t i say it all along? here’s his head all cut and full of broken
 glass. ’e’s been a-gettin’ over some bloomin’ wall or other. it’s a
 shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.
 this ’ere’s what comes of it. come along, bersicker.”
 
took the wolf and locked him up in cage, with piece of meat that
 satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the
 fatted calf, and went off to report.
 
i came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given
 to-day regarding the strange escapade at the zoo.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_17 september._--i was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my
 books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to lucy,
 had fallen sadly into arrear. suddenly the door was burst open, and in
 rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. i was
 thunderstruck, for such thing as patient getting of his own accord
 into the superintendent’s study is almost unknown. without an instant’s
 pause made straight at me. had dinner-knife in his hand, and,
 as i saw was dangerous, i tried to keep the table between us. was
 too quick and too strong for me, however; for before i could get my
 balance had struck at and cut my left wrist rather severely.
 before could strike again, however, i got in my right and was
 sprawling on his back on the floor. my wrist bled freely, and quite a
 little pool trickled on to the carpet. i saw that my friend was not
 intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,
 keeping wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. when the
 attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment
 positively sickened me. was lying on his belly on the floor licking
 up, like dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. was
 easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite
 placidly, simply repeating over and over again: “the blood is the life!
 the blood is the life!”
 
i cannot afford to lose blood just at present; i have lost too much of
 late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of lucy’s
 illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. i am over-excited and
 weary, and i need rest, rest, rest. happily helsing has not summoned
 me, so i need not forego my sleep; to-night i could not well do without
 it.
 

_telegram, helsing, antwerp, to seward, carfax._
 
(sent to carfax, sussex, as county given; delivered late by
 twenty-two hours.)
 
“_17 september._--do not fail to be at hillingham to-night. if not
 watching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as
 placed; very important; do not fail. shall be with you as soon as
 possible after arrival.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_18 september._--just off for train to london. the arrival of van
 helsing’s telegram filled with dismay. whole night lost, and i know
 by bitter experience what may happen in night. of course it is
 possible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? surely
 there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident
 should thwart us in all we try to do. i shall take this cylinder with
 me, and then i can complete my entry on lucy’s phonograph.
 

_memorandum left by lucy westenra._
 
_17 september. night._--i write this and leave it to be seen, so that no
 one may by any chance get into trouble through me. this is an exact
 record of what took place to-night. i feel i am dying of weakness, and
 have barely strength to write, but it must be done if i die in the
 doing.
 
i went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as dr.
 helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.
 
i was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that
 sleep-walking on the cliff at whitby when mina saved me, and which now i
 know so well. i was not afraid, but i did wish that dr. seward was in
 the next room--as dr. helsing said would be--so that i might have
 called him. i tried to go to sleep, but could not. then there came to me
 the old fear of sleep, and i determined to keep awake. perversely sleep
 would try to come then when i did not want it; so, as i feared to be
 alone, i opened my door and called out: “is there anybody there?” there
 was answer. i was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.
 then outside in the shrubbery i heard sort of howl like dog’s, but
 more fierce and deeper. i went to the window and looked out, but could
 see nothing, except big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its
 wings against the window. so i went back to bed again, but determined
 not to go to sleep. presently the door opened, and mother looked in;
 seeing by my moving that i was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. she
 said to even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--
 
“i was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all
 right.”
 
i feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in
 and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did
 not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay while
 and then go back to her own bed. as she lay there in my arms, and i in
 hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. she was
 startled and little frightened, and cried out: “what is that?” i tried
 to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but i could
 hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. after while there was
 the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a
 crash at the window, and lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.
 the window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the
 aperture of the broken panes there was the head of great, gaunt grey
 wolf. mother cried out in fright, and struggled up into sitting
 posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. amongst
 other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that dr. helsing
 insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. for a
 second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was strange
 and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck
 with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made dizzy for a
 moment or two. the room and all round seemed to spin round. i kept my
 eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and whole
 myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken
 window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that
 travellers describe when there is simoon in the desert. i tried to
 stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother’s poor body,
 which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to
 beat--weighed down; and i remembered more for while.
 
the time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till i recovered
 consciousness again. somewhere near, passing bell was tolling; the
 dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,
 seemingly just outside, nightingale was singing. i was dazed and
 stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the
 nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort
 me. the sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for i could hear
 their bare feet pattering outside my door. i called to them, and they
 came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay
 over on the bed, they screamed out. the wind rushed in through the
 broken window, and the door slammed to. they lifted off the body of my
 dear mother, and laid her, covered up with sheet, on the bed after i
 had got up. they were all so frightened and nervous that i directed them
 to go to the dining-room and have each glass of wine. the door flew
 open for an instant and closed again. the maids shrieked, and then went
 in body to the dining-room; and i laid what flowers i had on my dear
 mother’s breast. when they were there i remembered what dr. helsing
 had told me, but i didn’t like to remove them, and, besides, i would
 have some of the servants to sit up with now. i was surprised that
 the maids did not come back. i called them, but got answer, so i went
 to the dining-room to look for them.
 
my heart sank when i saw what had happened. they all four lay helpless
 on the floor, breathing heavily. the decanter of sherry was on the table
 half full, but there was queer, acrid smell about. i was suspicious,
 and examined the decanter. it smelt of laudanum, and looking on the
 sideboard, i found that the bottle which mother’s doctor uses for
 her--oh! did use--was empty. what am i to do? what am i to do? i am back
 in the room with mother. i cannot leave her, and i am alone, save for
 the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. alone with the dead! i
 dare not go out, for i can hear the low howl of the wolf through the
 broken window.
 
the air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from
 the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. what am i to do? god
 shield from harm this night! i shall hide this paper in my breast,
 where they shall find it when they come to lay out. my dear mother
 gone! it is time that i go too. good-bye, dear arthur, if i should not
 survive this night. god keep you, dear, and god help me!
 



chapter xii
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_18 september._--i drove at once to hillingham and arrived early.
 keeping my cab at the gate, i went up the avenue alone. i knocked gently
 and rang as quietly as possible, for i feared to disturb lucy or her
 mother, and hoped to only bring servant to the door. after while,
 finding response, i knocked and rang again; still answer. i cursed
 the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an
 hour--for it was now ten o’clock--and so rang and knocked again, but
 more impatiently, but still without response. hitherto i had blamed only
 the servants, but now terrible fear began to assail me. was this
 desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing
 tight around us? was it indeed house of death to which i had come, too
 late? i knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of
 danger to lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;
 and i went round the house to try if i could find by chance an entry
 anywhere.
 
i could find means of ingress. every window and door was fastened and
 locked, and i returned baffled to the porch. as i did so, i heard the
 rapid pit-pat of swiftly driven horse’s feet. they stopped at the
 gate, and few seconds later i met helsing running up the avenue.
 when saw me, gasped out:--
 
“then it was you, and just arrived. how is she? are we too late? did you
 not get my telegram?”
 
i answered as quickly and coherently as i could that i had only got his
 telegram early in the morning, and had not lost minute in coming here,
 and that i could not make any one in the house hear me. paused and
 raised his hat as said solemnly:--
 
“then i fear we are too late. god’s will be done!” with his usual
 recuperative energy, went on: “come. if there be way open to get
 in, we must make one. time is all in all to us now.”
 
we went round to the back of the house, where there was kitchen
 window. the professor took small surgical saw from his case, and
 handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. i
 attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. then
 with long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and
 opened the window. i helped the professor in, and followed him. there
 was one in the kitchen or in the servants’ rooms, which were close at
 hand. we tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,
 dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four
 servant-women lying on the floor. there was need to think them dead,
 for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the
 room left doubt as to their condition. helsing and i looked at
 each other, and as we moved away said: “we can attend to them later.”
 then we ascended to lucy’s room. for an instant or two we paused at the
 door to listen, but there was sound that we could hear. with white
 faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the
 room.
 
how shall i describe what we saw? on the bed lay two women, lucy and her
 mother. the latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with white
 sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the
 broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with look of terror
 fixed upon it. by her side lay lucy, with face white and still more
 drawn. the flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her
 mother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds
 which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.
 without word the professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching
 poor lucy’s breast; then gave quick turn of his head, as of one who
 listens, and leaping to his feet, cried out to me:--
 
“it is not yet too late! quick! quick! bring the brandy!”
 
i flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste
 it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which i found
 on the table. the maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and i
 fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. i did not stay to make sure,
 but returned to helsing. rubbed the brandy, as on another
 occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her
 hands. said to me:--
 
“i can do this, all that can be at the present. you go wake those maids.
 flick them in the face with wet towel, and flick them hard. make them
 get heat and fire and warm bath. this poor soul is nearly as cold as
 that beside her. she will need be heated before we can do anything
 more.”
 
i went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the
 women. the fourth was only young girl, and the drug had evidently
 affected her more strongly, so i lifted her on the sofa and let her
 sleep. the others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to
 them they cried and sobbed in hysterical manner. i was stern with
 them, however, and would not let them talk. i told them that one life
 was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice
 miss lucy. so, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad
 as they were, and prepared fire and water. fortunately, the kitchen and
 boiler fires were still alive, and there was lack of hot water. we
 got bath and carried lucy out as she was and placed her in it. whilst
 we were busy chafing her limbs there was knock at the hall door. one
 of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. then
 she returned and whispered to us that there was gentleman who had come
 with message from mr. holmwood. i bade her simply tell him that he
 must wait, for we could see one now. she went away with the message,
 and, engrossed with our work, i clean forgot all about him.
 
i never saw in all my experience the professor work in such deadly
 earnest. i knew--as knew--that it was stand-up fight with death,
 and in pause told him so. answered in way that i did not
 understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--
 
“if that were all, i would stop here where we are now, and let her fade
 away into peace, for i see light in life over her horizon.” went
 on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.
 
presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to
 be of some effect. lucy’s heart beat trifle more audibly to the
 stethoscope, and her lungs had perceptible movement. helsing’s
 face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in
 hot sheet to dry her said to me:--
 
“the first gain is ours! check to the king!”
 
we took lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid
 her in bed and forced few drops of brandy down her throat. i noticed
 that helsing tied soft silk handkerchief round her throat. she was
 still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had
 ever seen her.
 
helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her
 and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me
 out of the room.
 
“we must consult as to what is to be done,” said as we descended the
 stairs. in the hall opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he
 closing the door carefully behind him. the shutters had been opened, but
 the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of
 death which the british woman of the lower classes always rigidly
 observes. the room was, therefore, dimly dark. it was, however, light
 enough for our purposes. helsing’s sternness was somewhat relieved
 by look of perplexity. was evidently torturing his mind about
 something, so i waited for an instant, and spoke:--
 
“what are we to do now? where are we to turn for help? we must have
 another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl’s life
 won’t be worth an hour’s purchase. you are exhausted already; i am
 exhausted too. i fear to trust those women, even if they would have
 courage to submit. what are we to do for some one who will open his
 veins for her?”
 
“what’s the matter with me, anyhow?”
 
the voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought
 relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of quincey morris. van
 helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a
 glad look came into his eyes as i cried out: “quincey morris!” and
 rushed towards him with outstretched hands.
 
“what brought you here?” i cried as our hands met.
 
“i guess art is the cause.”
 
handed telegram:--
 
“have not heard from seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.
 cannot leave. father still in same condition. send word how lucy is.
 do not delay.--holmwood.”
 
“i think i came just in the nick of time. you know you have only to tell
 what to do.”
 
helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in
 the eyes as said:--
 
“a brave man’s blood is the best thing on this earth when woman is in
 trouble. you’re man and mistake. well, the devil may work against
 us for all he’s worth, but god sends us men when we want them.”
 
once again we went through that ghastly operation. i have not the heart
 to go through with the details. lucy had got terrible shock and it
 told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her
 veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other
 occasions. her struggle back into life was something frightful to see
 and hear. however, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and van
 helsing made subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with
 good effect. her faint became profound slumber. the professor watched
 whilst i went downstairs with quincey morris, and sent one of the maids
 to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. i left quincey lying down
 after having glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready good
 breakfast. then thought struck me, and i went back to the room where
 lucy now was. when i came softly in, i found helsing with sheet or
 two of note-paper in his hand. had evidently read it, and was
 thinking it over as sat with his hand to his brow. there was look
 of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had doubt solved.
 handed the paper saying only: “it dropped from lucy’s breast when
 we carried her to the bath.”
 
when i had read it, i stood looking at the professor, and after pause
 asked him: “in god’s name, what does it all mean? was she, or is she,
 mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?” i was so bewildered that i
 did not know what to say more. helsing put out his hand and took the
 paper, saying:--
 
“do not trouble about it now. forget it for the present. you shall know
 and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. and now what
 is it that you came to to say?” this brought back to fact, and i
 was all myself again.
 
“i came to speak about the certificate of death. if we do not act
 properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have
 to be produced. i am in hopes that we need have inquest, for if we
 had it would surely kill poor lucy, if nothing else did. i know, and you
 know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that mrs. westenra
 had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. let us
 fill up the certificate at once, and i shall take it myself to the
 registrar and go on to the undertaker.”
 
“good, oh my friend john! well thought of! truly miss lucy, if she be
 sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that
 love her. one, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old
 man. ah yes, i know, friend john; i am not blind! i love you all the
 more for it! now go.”
 
in the hall i met quincey morris, with telegram for arthur telling him
 that mrs. westenra was dead; that lucy also had been ill, but was now
 going on better; and that helsing and i were with her. i told him
 where i was going, and hurried out, but as i was going said:--
 
“when you come back, jack, may i have two words with you all to
 ourselves?” i nodded in reply and went out. i found difficulty about
 the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in
 the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.
 
when i got back quincey was waiting for me. i told him i would see him
 as soon as i knew about lucy, and went up to her room. she was still
 sleeping, and the professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her
 side. from his putting his finger to his lips, i gathered that he
 expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.
 so i went down to quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where
 the blinds were not drawn down, and which was little more cheerful, or
 rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. when we were alone, said
 to me:--
 
“jack seward, i don’t want to shove myself in anywhere where i’ve no
 right to be; but this is ordinary case. you know i loved that girl
 and wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and gone, i can’t
 help feeling anxious about her all the same. what is it that’s wrong
 with her? the dutchman--and fine old fellow is; i can see
 that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have
 _another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and were exhausted.
 now i know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that man
 must not expect to know what they consult about in private. but this is
 common matter, and, whatever it is, i have done my part. is not that
 so?”
 
“that’s so,” i said, and went on:--
 
“i take it that both you and helsing had done already what i did
 to-day. is not that so?”
 
“that’s so.”
 
“and i guess art was in it too. when i saw him four days ago down at his
 own place looked queer. i have not seen anything pulled down so quick
 since i was on the pampas and had mare that i was fond of go to grass
 all in night. one of those big bats that they call vampires had got at
 her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there
 wasn’t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and i had to put a
 bullet through her as she lay. jack, if you may tell without
 betraying confidence, arthur was the first, is not that so?” as spoke
 the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. was in torture of suspense
 regarding the woman loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible
 mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. his very
 heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a
 royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. i paused before
 answering, for i felt that i must not betray anything which the
 professor wished kept secret; but already knew so much, and guessed
 so much, that there could be reason for not answering, so i answered
 in the same phrase: “that’s so.”
 
“and how long has this been going on?”
 
“about ten days.”
 
“ten days! then i guess, jack seward, that that poor pretty creature
 that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood
 of four strong men. man alive, her whole body wouldn’t hold it.” then,
 coming close to me, spoke in fierce half-whisper: “what took it
 out?”
 
i shook my head. “that,” i said, “is the crux. helsing is simply
 frantic about it, and i am at my wits’ end. i can’t even hazard guess.
 there has been series of little circumstances which have thrown out
 all our calculations as to lucy being properly watched. but these shall
 not occur again. here we stay until all be well--or ill.” quincey held
 out his hand. “count in,” said. “you and the dutchman will tell me
 what to do, and i’ll do it.”
 
when she woke late in the afternoon, lucy’s first movement was to feel
 in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which helsing
 had given to read. the careful professor had replaced it where it had
 come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. her eye then lit on van
 helsing and on too, and gladdened. then she looked around the room,
 and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave loud cry, and put her
 poor thin hands before her pale face. we both understood what that
 meant--that she had realised to the full her mother’s death; so we tried
 what we could to comfort her. doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but
 she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for
 long time. we told her that either or both of us would now remain with
 her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. towards dusk she fell
 into doze. here very odd thing occurred. whilst still asleep she
 took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. helsing stepped
 over and took the pieces from her. all the same, however, she went on
 with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her
 hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering
 the fragments. helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as
 if in thought, but said nothing.
 
* * * * *
 
_19 september._--all last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid
 to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. the professor and
 i took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for moment
 unattended. quincey morris said nothing about his intention, but i knew
 that all night long patrolled round and round the house.
 
when the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor lucy’s
 strength. she was hardly able to turn her head, and the little
 nourishment which she could take seemed to do her good. at times she
 slept, and both helsing and i noticed the difference in her, between
 sleeping and waking. whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more
 haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale
 gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and
 sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently
 changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although dying
 one. in the afternoon she asked for arthur, and we telegraphed for him.
 quincey went off to meet him at the station.
 
when arrived it was nearly six o’clock, and the sun was setting full
 and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more
 colour to the pale cheeks. when saw her, arthur was simply choking
 with emotion, and none of us could speak. in the hours that had passed,
 the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had
 grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible
 were shortened. arthur’s presence, however, seemed to act as a
 stimulant; she rallied little, and spoke to him more brightly than she
 had done since we arrived. too pulled himself together, and spoke as
 cheerily as could, so that the best was made of everything.
 
it was now nearly one o’clock, and and helsing are sitting with
 her. i am to relieve them in quarter of an hour, and i am entering
 this on lucy’s phonograph. until six o’clock they are to try to rest. i
 fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too
 great; the poor child cannot rally. god help us all.

“my dearest lucy,--
 
“it seems _an age_ since i heard from you, or indeed since i wrote. you
 will pardon me, i know, for all my faults when you have read all my
 budget of news. well, i got my husband back all right; when we arrived
 at exeter there was carriage waiting for us, and in it, though had
 an attack of gout, mr. hawkins. took us to his house, where there
 were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. after
 dinner mr. hawkins said:--
 
“‘my dears, i want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every
 blessing attend you both. i know you both from children, and have, with
 love and pride, seen you grow up. now i want you to make your home here
 with me. i have left to neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in
 my will i have left you everything.’ i cried, lucy dear, as jonathan and
 the old man clasped hands. our evening was very, very happy one.
 
“so here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my
 bedroom and the drawing-room i can see the great elms of the cathedral
 close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow
 stone of the cathedral and i can hear the rooks overhead cawing and
 cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of
 rooks--and humans. i am busy, i need not tell you, arranging things and
 housekeeping. jonathan and mr. hawkins are busy all day; for, now that
 jonathan is partner, mr. hawkins wants to tell him all about the
 clients.
 
“how is your dear mother getting on? i wish i could run up to town for a
 day or two to see you, dear, but i dare not go yet, with so much on my
 shoulders; and jonathan wants looking after still. is beginning to
 put some flesh on his bones again, but was terribly weakened by the
 long illness; even now sometimes starts out of his sleep in sudden
 way and awakes all trembling until i can coax him back to his usual
 placidity. however, thank god, these occasions grow less frequent as the
 days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, i trust. and now
 i have told you my news, let ask yours. when are you to be married,
 and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,
 and is it to be public or private wedding? tell all about it,
 dear; tell all about everything, for there is nothing which interests
 you which will not be dear to me. jonathan asks to send his
 ‘respectful duty,’ but i do not think that is good enough from the
 junior partner of the important firm hawkins & harker; and so, as you
 love me, and loves me, and i love you with all the moods and tenses
 of the verb, i send you simply his ‘love’ instead. good-bye, my dearest
 lucy, and all blessings on you.
 
“yours,
 
“mina harker.”

“my dear sir,--
 
“in accordance with your wishes, i enclose report of the conditions of
 everything left in my charge.... with regard to patient, renfield, there
 is more to say. has had another outbreak, which might have had a
 dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended
 with any unhappy results. this afternoon carrier’s cart with two men
 made call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to
 which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. the men stopped at
 our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. i was
 myself looking out of the study window, having smoke after dinner, and
 saw one of them come up to the house. as passed the window of
 renfield’s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called
 him all the foul names could lay his tongue to. the man, who seemed a
 decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to “shut up for a
 foul-mouthed beggar,” whereon our man accused him of robbing him and
 wanting to murder him and said that would hinder him if were to
 swing for it. i opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,
 so contented himself after looking the place over and making up his
 mind as to what kind of place had got to by saying: ‘lor’ bless
 yer, sir, i wouldn’t mind what was said to in bloomin’ madhouse. i
 pity ye and the guv’nor for havin’ to live in the house with wild
 beast like that.’ then asked his way civilly enough, and i told him
 where the gate of the empty house was; went away, followed by threats
 and curses and revilings from our man. i went down to see if i could
 make out any cause for his anger, since is usually such a
 well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had
 ever occurred. i found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most
 genial in his manner. i tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he
 blandly asked questions as to what i meant, and led to believe
 that was completely oblivious of the affair. it was, i am sorry to
 say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an
 hour i heard of him again. this time had broken out through the
 window of his room, and was running down the avenue. i called to the
 attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for i feared was intent
 on some mischief. my fear was justified when i saw the same cart which
 had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden
 boxes. the men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the
 face, as if with violent exercise. before i could get up to him the
 patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to
 knock his head against the ground. if i had not seized him just at the
 moment i believe would have killed the man there and then. the other
 fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his
 heavy whip. it was terrible blow; but did not seem to mind it, but
 seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and
 fro as if we were kittens. you know i am light weight, and the others
 were both burly men. at first was silent in his fighting; but as we
 began to master him, and the attendants were putting strait-waistcoat
 on him, began to shout: ‘i’ll frustrate them! they shan’t rob me!
 they shan’t murder by inches! i’ll fight for my lord and master!’ and
 all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. it was with very considerable
 difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded
 room. one of the attendants, hardy, had finger broken. however, i set
 it all right; and is going on well.
 
“the two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for
 damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. their
 threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for
 the defeat of the two of them by feeble madman. they said that if it
 had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and
 raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of
 him. they gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary
 state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of
 their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their
 labours of any place of public entertainment. i quite understood their
 drift, and after stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and
 with each sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
 that they would encounter worse madman any day for the pleasure of
 meeting so ‘bloomin’ good bloke’ as your correspondent. i took their
 names and addresses, in case they might be needed. they are as
 follows:--jack smollet, of dudding’s rents, king george’s road, great
 walworth, and thomas snelling, peter farley’s row, guide court, bethnal
 green. they are both in the employment of harris & sons, moving and
 shipment company, orange master’s yard, soho.
 
“i shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall
 wire you at once if there is anything of importance.
 
“believe me, dear sir,
 
“yours faithfully,
 
“patrick hennessey.”

“my dearest lucy,--
 
“such sad blow has befallen us. mr. hawkins has died very suddenly.
 some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him
 that it really seems as though we had lost father. i never knew either
 father or mother, so that the dear old man’s death is real blow to me.
 jonathan is greatly distressed. it is not only that feels sorrow,
 deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,
 and now at the end has treated him like his own and left him a
 fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the
 dream of avarice, but jonathan feels it on another account. says the
 amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. he
 begins to doubt himself. i try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_
 helps him to have belief in himself. but it is here that the grave
 shock that experienced tells upon him the most. oh, it is too hard
 that sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which
 enabled him by our dear, good friend’s aid to rise from clerk to master
 in few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its
 strength is gone. forgive me, dear, if i worry you with my troubles in
 the midst of your own happiness; but, lucy dear, i must tell some one,
 for the strain of keeping up brave and cheerful appearance to jonathan
 tries me, and i have one here that i can confide in. i dread coming
 up to london, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor mr.
 hawkins left in his will that was to be buried in the grave with his
 father. as there are relations at all, jonathan will have to be chief
 mourner. i shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for few
 minutes. forgive for troubling you. with all blessings,
 
“your loving
 
“mina harker.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_20 september._--only resolution and habit can let make an entry
 to-night. i am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world
 and all in it, including life itself, that i would not care if i heard
 this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. and has
 been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--lucy’s mother
 and arthur’s father, and now.... let get on with my work.
 
i duly relieved helsing in his watch over lucy. we wanted arthur to
 go to rest also, but refused at first. it was only when i told him
 that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not
 all break down for want of rest, lest lucy should suffer, that agreed
 to go. helsing was very kind to him. “come, my child,” said;
 “come with me. you are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much
 mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. you
 must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.
 come to the drawing-room, where there is big fire, and there are two
 sofas. you shall lie on one, and i on the other, and our sympathy will
 be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we
 sleep.” arthur went off with him, casting back longing look on lucy’s
 face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. she lay
 quite still, and i looked round the room to see that all was as it
 should be. i could see that the professor had carried out in this room,
 as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the
 window-sashes reeked with it, and round lucy’s neck, over the silk
 handkerchief which helsing made her keep on, was rough chaplet of
 the same odorous flowers. lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and
 her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. her
 teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they
 had been in the morning. in particular, by some trick of the light, the
 canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. i sat down by her,
 and presently she moved uneasily. at the same moment there came sort
 of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. i went over to it softly,
 and peeped out by the corner of the blind. there was full moonlight,
 and i could see that the noise was made by great bat, which wheeled
 round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now
 and again struck the window with its wings. when i came back to my seat,
 i found that lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic
 flowers from her throat. i replaced them as well as i could, and sat
 watching her.
 
presently she woke, and i gave her food, as helsing had prescribed.
 she took but little, and that languidly. there did not seem to be with
 her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto
 so marked her illness. it struck as curious that the moment she
 became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. it was
 certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the
 stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she
 waked she clutched them close. there was possibility of making any
 mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many
 spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.
 
at six o’clock helsing came to relieve me. arthur had then fallen
 into doze, and mercifully let him sleep on. when saw lucy’s face
 i could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and said to in a
 sharp whisper: “draw up the blind; i want light!” then bent down,
 and, with his face almost touching lucy’s, examined her carefully. he
 removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. as
 did so started back, and i could hear his ejaculation, “mein
 gott!” as it was smothered in his throat. i bent over and looked, too,
 and as i noticed some queer chill came over me.
 
the wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.
 
for fully five minutes helsing stood looking at her, with his face
 at its sternest. then turned to and said calmly:--
 
“she is dying. it will not be long now. it will be much difference, mark
 me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. wake that poor boy, and
 let him come and see the last; trusts us, and we have promised him.”
 
i went to the dining-room and waked him. was dazed for moment, but
 when saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters
 thought was late, and expressed his fear. i assured him that lucy
 was still asleep, but told him as gently as i could that both van
 helsing and i feared that the end was near. covered his face with his
 hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where remained,
 perhaps minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders
 shook with grief. i took him by the hand and raised him up. “come,” i
 said, “my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best
 and easiest for her.”
 
when we came into lucy’s room i could see that helsing had, with
 his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making
 everything look as pleasing as possible. had even brushed lucy’s
 hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. when we
 came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered
 softly:--
 
“arthur! oh, my love, i am so glad you have come!” was stooping to
 kiss her, when helsing motioned him back. “no,” whispered, “not
 yet! hold her hand; it will comfort her more.”
 
so arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,
 with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. then
 gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. for little bit her
 breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like tired child’s.
 
and then insensibly there came the strange change which i had noticed in
 the night. her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale
 gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. in a
 sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which
 were now dull and hard at once, and said in soft, voluptuous voice,
 such as i had never heard from her lips:--
 
“arthur! oh, my love, i am so glad you have come! kiss me!” arthur bent
 eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant helsing, who, like me,
 had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by
 the neck with both hands, dragged him back with fury of strength which
 i never thought could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost
 across the room.
 
“not for your life!” said; “not for your living soul and hers!” and
 stood between them like lion at bay.
 
arthur was so taken aback that did not for moment know what to do
 or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him realised
 the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.
 
i kept my eyes fixed on lucy, as did helsing, and we saw spasm as
 of rage flit like shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed
 together. then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.
 
very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and
 putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took helsing’s great brown
 one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. “my true friend,” she said, in a
 faint voice, but with untellable pathos, “my true friend, and his! oh,
 guard him, and give peace!”
 
“i swear it!” said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his
 hand, as one who registers an oath. then turned to arthur, and said
 to him: “come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the
 forehead, and only once.”
 
their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.
 
lucy’s eyes closed; and helsing, who had been watching closely, took
 arthur’s arm, and drew him away.
 
and then lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it
 ceased.
 
“it is all over,” said helsing. “she is dead!”
 
i took arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he
 sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in way that
 nearly broke down to see.
 
i went back to the room, and found helsing looking at poor lucy, and
 his face was sterner than ever. some change had come over her body.
 death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had
 recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their
 deadly pallor. it was as if the blood, longer needed for the working
 of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as
 might be.
 
“we thought her dying whilst she slept,
 and sleeping when she died.”
 
i stood beside helsing, and said:--
 
“ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. it is the end!”
 
turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--
 
“not so; alas! not so. it is only the beginning!”
 
when i asked him what meant, only shook his head and answered:--
 
“we can do nothing as yet. wait and see.”
 



chapter xiii
 
dr. seward’s diary--_continued_.
 

the funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that lucy and
 her mother might be buried together. i attended to all the ghastly
 formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were
 afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.
 even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to
 me, in confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out
 from the death-chamber:--
 
“she makes very beautiful corpse, sir. it’s quite privilege to
 attend on her. it’s not too much to say that she will do credit to our
 establishment!”
 
i noticed that helsing never kept far away. this was possible from
 the disordered state of things in the household. there were relatives
 at hand; and as arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his
 father’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been
 bidden. under the circumstances, helsing and i took it upon
 ourselves to examine papers, etc. insisted upon looking over lucy’s
 papers himself. i asked him why, for i feared that he, being a
 foreigner, might not be quite aware of english legal requirements, and
 so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. answered me:--
 
“i know; i know. you forget that i am lawyer as well as doctor. but
 this is not altogether for the law. you knew that, when you avoided the
 coroner. i have more than him to avoid. there may be papers more--such
 as this.”
 
as spoke took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been
 in lucy’s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.
 
“when you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late mrs.
 westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. for me, i watch
 here in the room and in miss lucy’s old room all night, and i myself
 search for what may be. it is not well that her very thoughts go into
 the hands of strangers.”
 
i went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found
 the name and address of mrs. westenra’s solicitor and had written to
 him. all the poor lady’s papers were in order; explicit directions
 regarding the place of burial were given. i had hardly sealed the
 letter, when, to my surprise, helsing walked into the room,
 saying:--
 
“can i help you, friend john? i am free, and if i may, my service is to
 you.”
 
“have you got what you looked for?” i asked, to which replied:--
 
“i did not look for any specific thing. i only hoped to find, and find i
 have, all that there was--only some letters and few memoranda, and a
 diary new begun. but i have them here, and we shall for the present say
 nothing of them. i shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
 his sanction, i shall use some.”
 
when we had finished the work in hand, said to me:--
 
“and now, friend john, i think we may to bed. we want sleep, both you
 and i, and rest to recuperate. to-morrow we shall have much to do, but
 for the to-night there is need of us. alas!”
 
before turning in we went to look at poor lucy. the undertaker had
 certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into small
 _chapelle ardente_. there was wilderness of beautiful white flowers,
 and death was made as little repulsive as might be. the end of the
 winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the professor bent over and
 turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall
 wax candles showing sufficient light to note it well. all lucy’s
 loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,
 instead of leaving traces of “decay’s effacing fingers,” had but
 restored the beauty of life, till positively i could not believe my eyes
 that i was looking at corpse.
 
the professor looked sternly grave. had not loved her as i had, and
 there was need for tears in his eyes. said to me: “remain till i
 return,” and left the room. came back with handful of wild garlic
 from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and
 placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. then he
 took from his neck, inside his collar, little gold crucifix, and
 placed it over the mouth. restored the sheet to its place, and we
 came away.
 
i was undressing in my own room, when, with premonitory tap at the
 door, entered, and at once began to speak:--
 
“to-morrow i want you to bring me, before night, set of post-mortem
 knives.”
 
“must we make an autopsy?” i asked.
 
“yes and no. i want to operate, but not as you think. let tell you
 now, but not word to another. i want to cut off her head and take out
 her heart. ah! you surgeon, and so shocked! you, whom i have seen with
 tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make
 the rest shudder. oh, but i must not forget, my dear friend john, that
 you loved her; and i have not forgotten it, for it is i that shall
 operate, and you must only help. i would like to do it to-night, but for
 arthur i must not; will be free after his father’s funeral to-morrow,
 and will want to see her--to see _it_. then, when she is coffined
 ready for the next day, you and i shall come when all sleep. we shall
 unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace
 all, so that none know, save we alone.”
 
“but why do it at all? the girl is dead. why mutilate her poor body
 without need? and if there is necessity for post-mortem and nothing
 to gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human
 knowledge--why do it? without such it is monstrous.”
 
for answer put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite
 tenderness:--
 
“friend john, i pity your poor bleeding heart; and i love you the more
 because it does so bleed. if i could, i would take on myself the burden
 that you do bear. but there are things that you know not, but that you
 shall know, and bless for knowing, though they are not pleasant
 things. john, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet
 did you ever know to do any without good cause? i may err--i am but
 man; but i believe in all i do. was it not for these causes that you
 send for when the great trouble came? yes! were you not amazed, nay
 horrified, when i would not let arthur kiss his love--though she was
 dying--and snatched him away by all my strength? yes! and yet you saw
 how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so
 weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? yes! and did you not
 hear swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? yes!
 
“well, i have good reason now for all i want to do. you have for many
 years trust me; you have believe weeks past, when there be things so
 strange that you might have well doubt. believe yet little, friend
 john. if you trust not, then i must tell what i think; and that is
 not perhaps well. and if i work--as work i shall, matter trust or no
 trust--without my friend trust in me, i work with heavy heart and feel,
 oh! so lonely when i want all help and courage that may be!” paused a
 moment and went on solemnly: “friend john, there are strange and
 terrible days before us. let us not be two, but one, that so we work to
 good end. will you not have faith in me?”
 
i took his hand, and promised him. i held my door open as went away,
 and watched him go into his room and close the door. as i stood without
 moving, i saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had
 her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where lucy
 lay. the sight touched me. devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful
 to those who show it unasked to those we love. here was poor girl
 putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch
 alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay
 might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....
 
* * * * *
 
i must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when van
 helsing waked by coming into my room. came over to my bedside and
 said:--
 
“you need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.”
 
“why not?” i asked. for his solemnity of the night before had greatly
 impressed me.
 
“because,” said sternly, “it is too late--or too early. see!” here he
 held up the little golden crucifix. “this was stolen in the night.”
 
“how, stolen,” i asked in wonder, “since you have it now?”
 
“because i get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the
 woman who robbed the dead and the living. her punishment will surely
 come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus
 unknowing, she only stole. now we must wait.”
 
went away on the word, leaving with new mystery to think of, a
 new puzzle to grapple with.
 
the forenoon was dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: mr.
 marquand, of wholeman, sons, marquand & lidderdale. was very genial
 and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all
 cares as to details. during lunch told us that mrs. westenra had for
 some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs
 in absolute order; informed us that, with the exception of certain
 entailed property of lucy’s father’s which now, in default of direct
 issue, went back to distant branch of the family, the whole estate,
 real and personal, was left absolutely to arthur holmwood. when had
 told us so much went on:--
 
“frankly we did our best to prevent such testamentary disposition, and
 pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either
 penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding matrimonial
 alliance. indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into
 collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out
 her wishes. of course, we had then alternative but to accept. we were
 right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of hundred we should
 have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.
 frankly, however, i must admit that in this case any other form of
 disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her
 wishes. for by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come
 into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her
 mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no
 will--and will was practical impossibility in such case--have been
 treated at her decease as under intestacy. in which case lord godalming,
 though so dear friend, would have had claim in the world; and the
 inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just
 rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. i assure
 you, my dear sirs, i am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.”
 
was good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which
 was officially interested--of so great tragedy, was an
 object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.
 
did not remain long, but said would look in later in the day and
 see lord godalming. his coming, however, had been certain comfort to
 us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile
 criticism as to any of our acts. arthur was expected at five o’clock, so
 little before that time we visited the death-chamber. it was so in
 very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. the undertaker,
 true to his craft, had made the best display could of his goods, and
 there was mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at
 once. helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,
 explaining that, as lord godalming was coming very soon, it would be
 less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_
 quite alone. the undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and
 exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them
 the night before, so that when arthur came such shocks to his feelings
 as we could avoid were saved.
 
poor fellow! looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart
 manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his
 much-tried emotions. had, i knew, been very genuinely and devotedly
 attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such time, was a
 bitter blow to him. with was warm as ever, and to helsing he
 was sweetly courteous; but i could not help seeing that there was some
 constraint with him. the professor noticed it, too, and motioned to
 bring him upstairs. i did so, and left him at the door of the room, as i
 felt would like to be quite alone with her, but took my arm and
 led in, saying huskily:--
 
“you loved her too, old fellow; she told all about it, and there was
 friend had closer place in her heart than you. i don’t know how to
 thank you for all you have done for her. i can’t think yet....”
 
here suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and
 laid his head on my breast, crying:--
 
“oh, jack! jack! what shall i do! the whole of life seems gone from me
 all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for to live for.”
 
i comforted him as well as i could. in such cases men do not need much
 expression. grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the
 shoulder, sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to man’s
 heart. i stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then i said
 softly to him:--
 
“come and look at her.”
 
together we moved over to the bed, and i lifted the lawn from her face.
 god! how beautiful she was. every hour seemed to be enhancing her
 loveliness. it frightened and amazed somewhat; and as for arthur, he
 fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. at
 last, after long pause, said to in faint whisper:--
 
“jack, is she really dead?”
 
i assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for i felt
 that such horrible doubt should not have life for moment longer than
 i could help--that it often happened that after death faces became
 softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was
 especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged
 suffering. it seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after
 kneeling beside the couch for while and looking at her lovingly and
 long, turned aside. i told him that that must be good-bye, as the
 coffin had to be prepared; so went back and took her dead hand in his
 and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. came away,
 fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as came.
 
i left him in the drawing-room, and told helsing that had said
 good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker’s men
 to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. when he
 came out of the room again i told him of arthur’s question, and he
 replied:--
 
“i am not surprised. just now i doubted for moment myself!”
 
we all dined together, and i could see that poor art was trying to make
 the best of things. helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but
 when we had lit our cigars said--
 
“lord----”; but arthur interrupted him:--
 
“no, no, not that, for god’s sake! not yet at any rate. forgive me, sir:
 i did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so
 recent.”
 
the professor answered very sweetly:--
 
“i only used that name because i was in doubt. i must not call you
 ‘mr.,’ and i have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as
 arthur.”
 
arthur held out his hand, and took the old man’s warmly.
 
“call what you will,” said. “i hope i may always have the title of
 friend. and let say that i am at loss for words to thank you for
 your goodness to my poor dear.” paused moment, and went on: “i know
 that she understood your goodness even better than i do; and if i was
 rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember”--the
 professor nodded--“you must forgive me.”
 
answered with grave kindness:--
 
“i know it was hard for you to quite trust then, for to trust such
 violence needs to understand; and i take it that you do not--that you
 cannot--trust now, for you do not yet understand. and there may be
 more times when i shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may
 not--and must not yet understand. but the time will come when your trust
 shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as
 though the sunlight himself shone through. then you shall bless from
 first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her
 dear sake to whom i swore to protect.”
 
“and, indeed, indeed, sir,” said arthur warmly, “i shall in all ways
 trust you. i know and believe you have very noble heart, and you are
 jack’s friend, and you were hers. you shall do what you like.”
 
the professor cleared his throat couple of times, as though about to
 speak, and finally said:--
 
“may i ask you something now?”
 
“certainly.”
 
“you know that mrs. westenra left you all her property?”
 
“no, poor dear; i never thought of it.”
 
“and as it is all yours, you have right to deal with it as you will. i
 want you to give permission to read all miss lucy’s papers and
 letters. believe me, it is idle curiosity. i have motive of which,
 be sure, she would have approved. i have them all here. i took them
 before we knew that all was yours, so that strange hand might touch
 them--no strange eye look through words into her soul. i shall keep
 them, if i may; even you may not see them yet, but i shall keep them
 safe. word shall be lost; and in the good time i shall give them back
 to you. it’s hard thing i ask, but you will do it, will you not, for
 lucy’s sake?”
 
arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--
 
“dr. helsing, you may do what you will. i feel that in saying this i
 am doing what my dear one would have approved. i shall not trouble you
 with questions till the time comes.”
 
the old professor stood up as said solemnly:--
 
“and you are right. there will be pain for us all; but it will not be
 all pain, nor will this pain be the last. we and you too--you most of
 all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we
 reach the sweet. but we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our
 duty, and all will be well!”
 
i slept on sofa in arthur’s room that night. helsing did not go to
 bed at all. went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was
 never out of sight of the room where lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with
 the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,
 heavy, overpowering smell into the night.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_22 september._--in the train to exeter. jonathan sleeping.
 
it seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much
 between then, in whitby and all the world before me, jonathan away and
 news of him; and now, married to jonathan, jonathan solicitor, a
 partner, rich, master of his business, mr. hawkins dead and buried, and
 jonathan with another attack that may harm him. some day may ask me
 about it. down it all goes. i am rusty in my shorthand--see what
 unexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up
 again with an exercise anyhow....
 
the service was very simple and very solemn. there were only ourselves
 and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from exeter, his
 london agent, and gentleman representing sir john paxton, the
 president of the incorporated law society. jonathan and i stood hand in
 hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....
 
we came back to town quietly, taking ’bus to hyde park corner.
 jonathan thought it would interest to go into the row for while, so
 we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was
 sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. it made us think
 of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down piccadilly.
 jonathan was holding by the arm, the way used to in old days
 before i went to school. i felt it very improper, for you can’t go on
 for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the
 pedantry of it biting into yourself bit; but it was jonathan, and he
 was my husband, and we didn’t know anybody who saw us--and we didn’t
 care if they did--so on we walked. i was looking at very beautiful
 girl, in big cart-wheel hat, sitting in victoria outside guiliano’s,
 when i felt jonathan clutch my arm so tight that hurt me, and said
 under his breath: “my god!” i am always anxious about jonathan, for i
 fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so i turned to him
 quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.
 
was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and
 half in amazement, gazed at tall, thin man, with beaky nose and
 black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty
 girl. was looking at her so hard that did not see either of us,
 and so i had good view of him. his face was not good face; it was
 hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all
 the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal’s.
 jonathan kept staring at him, till i was afraid would notice. i
 feared might take it ill, looked so fierce and nasty. i asked
 jonathan why was disturbed, and answered, evidently thinking that
 i knew as much about it as did: “do you see who it is?”
 
“no, dear,” i said; “i don’t know him; who is it?” his answer seemed to
 shock and thrill me, for it was said as if did not know that it was
 to me, mina, to whom was speaking:--
 
“it is the man himself!”
 
the poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly
 terrified; i do believe that if had not had to lean on and to
 support him would have sunk down. kept staring; man came out of
 the shop with small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove
 off. the dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage
 moved up piccadilly followed in the same direction, and hailed a
 hansom. jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--
 
“i believe it is the count, but has grown young. my god, if this be
 so! oh, my god! my god! if i only knew! if i only knew!” was
 distressing himself so much that i feared to keep his mind on the
 subject by asking him any questions, so i remained silent. i drew him
 away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. we walked little
 further, and then went in and sat for while in the green park. it was
 hot day for autumn, and there was comfortable seat in shady place.
 after few minutes’ staring at nothing, jonathan’s eyes closed, and he
 went quietly into sleep, with his head on my shoulder. i thought it
 was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. in about twenty
 minutes woke up, and said to quite cheerfully:--
 
“why, mina, have i been asleep! oh, do forgive for being so rude.
 come, and we’ll have cup of tea somewhere.” had evidently forgotten
 all about the dark stranger, as in his illness had forgotten all that
 this episode had reminded him of. i don’t like this lapsing into
 forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. i must
 not ask him, for fear i shall do more harm than good; but i must somehow
 learn the facts of his journey abroad. the time is come, i fear, when i
 must open that parcel, and know what is written. oh, jonathan, you will,
 i know, forgive if i do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--a sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dear
 soul who was so good to us; jonathan still pale and dizzy under slight
 relapse of his malady; and now telegram from helsing, whoever he
 may be:--
 
“you will be grieved to hear that mrs. westenra died five days ago, and
 that lucy died the day before yesterday. they were both buried to-day.”
 
oh, what wealth of sorrow in few words! poor mrs. westenra! poor
 lucy! gone, gone, never to return to us! and poor, poor arthur, to have
 lost such sweetness out of his life! god help us all to bear our
 troubles.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_22 september._--it is all over. arthur has gone back to ring, and has
 taken quincey morris with him. what fine fellow is quincey! i believe
 in my heart of hearts that suffered as much about lucy’s death as any
 of us; but bore himself through it like moral viking. if america
 can go on breeding men like that, she will be power in the world
 indeed. helsing is lying down, having rest preparatory to his
 journey. goes over to amsterdam to-night, but says returns
 to-morrow night; that only wants to make some arrangements which can
 only be made personally. is to stop with then, if can; says
 has work to do in london which may take him some time. poor old
 fellow! i fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his
 iron strength. all the time of the burial was, i could see, putting
 some terrible restraint on himself. when it was all over, we were
 standing beside arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in
 the operation where his blood had been transfused to his lucy’s veins; i
 could see helsing’s face grow white and purple by turns. arthur was
 saying that felt since then as if they two had been really married
 and that she was his wife in the sight of god. none of us said word of
 the other operations, and none of us ever shall. arthur and quincey went
 away together to the station, and helsing and i came on here. the
 moment we were alone in the carriage gave way to regular fit of
 hysterics. has denied to since that it was hysterics, and insisted
 that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very
 terrible conditions. laughed till cried, and i had to draw down
 the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then cried,
 till laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as woman
 does. i tried to be stern with him, as one is to woman under the
 circumstances; but it had effect. men and women are so different in
 manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! then when his face grew
 grave and stern again i asked him why his mirth, and why at such time.
 his reply was in way characteristic of him, for it was logical and
 forceful and mysterious. said:--
 
“ah, you don’t comprehend, friend john. do not think that i am not sad,
 though i laugh. see, i have cried even when the laugh did choke me. but
 more think that i am all sorry when i cry, for the laugh come
 just the same. keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your
 door and say, ‘may i come in?’ is not the true laughter. no! is a
 king, and come when and how like. ask person; choose no
 time of suitability. say, ‘i am here.’ behold, in example i grieve my
 heart out for that so sweet young girl; i give my blood for her, though
 i am old and worn; i give my time, my skill, my sleep; i let my other
 sufferers want that so she may have all. and yet i can laugh at her very
 grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her
 coffin and say ‘thud! thud!’ to my heart, till it send back the blood
 from my cheek. my heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of
 the age of mine own boy had i been so blessed that live, and with his
 hair and eyes the same. there, you know now why i love him so. and yet
 when say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my
 father-heart yearn to him as to other man--not even to you, friend
 john, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even
 at such moment king laugh come to and shout and bellow in my ear,
 ‘here i am! here i am!’ till the blood come dance back and bring some of
 the sunshine that carry with him to my cheek. oh, friend john, it is
 strange world, sad world, world full of miseries, and woes, and
 troubles; and yet when king laugh come make them all dance to the
 tune play. bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and
 tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he
 make with that smileless mouth of him. and believe me, friend john, that
 is good to come, and kind. ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn
 tight with strain that pull us different ways. then tears come; and,
 like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain
 become too great, and we break. but king laugh come like the
 sunshine, and ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with
 our labour, what it may be.”
 
i did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as i
 did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, i asked him. as he
 answered his face grew stern, and said in quite different
 tone:--
 
“oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with
 flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she
 were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely
 churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother
 who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going ‘toll!
 toll! toll!’ so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white
 garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time
 their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. and all
 for what? she is dead; so! is it not?”
 
“well, for the life of me, professor,” i said, “i can’t see anything to
 laugh at in all that. why, your explanation makes it harder puzzle
 than before. but even if the burial service was comic, what about poor
 art and his trouble? why, his heart was simply breaking.”
 
“just so. said not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had
 made her truly his bride?”
 
“yes, and it was sweet and comforting idea for him.”
 
“quite so. but there was difficulty, friend john. if so that, then
 what about the others? ho, ho! then this so sweet maid is polyandrist,
 and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by church’s law, though
 wits, all gone--even i, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,
 am bigamist.”
 
“i don’t see where the joke comes in there either!” i said; and i did
 not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. laid
 his hand on my arm, and said:--
 
“friend john, forgive if i pain. i showed not my feeling to others
 when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom i can trust.
 if you could have looked into my very heart then when i want to laugh;
 if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so
 now, when king laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for
 go far, far away from me, and for long, long time--maybe you would
 perhaps pity the most of all.”
 
i was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.
 
“because i know!”
 
and now we are all scattered; and for many long day loneliness will
 sit over our roofs with brooding wings. lucy lies in the tomb of her
 kin, lordly death-house in lonely churchyard, away from teeming
 london; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over hampstead hill,
 and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.
 
so i can finish this diary; and god only knows if i shall ever begin
 another. if i do, or if i even open this again, it will be to deal with
 different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the
 romance of my life is told, ere i go back to take up the thread of my
 life-work, i say sadly and without hope,
 
“finis.”
 

_“the westminster gazette,” 25 september._
 
hampstead mystery.
 

the neighbourhood of hampstead is just at present exercised with a
 series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what
 was known to the writers of headlines as “the kensington horror,” or
 “the stabbing woman,” or “the woman in black.” during the past two or
 three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from
 home or neglecting to return from their playing on the heath. in all
 these cases the children were too young to give any properly
 intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses
 is that they had been with “bloofer lady.” it has always been late in
 the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the
 children have not been found until early in the following morning. it is
 generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed
 gave as his reason for being away that “bloofer lady” had asked him to
 come for walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as
 occasion served. this is the more natural as the favourite game of the
 little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. a
 correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to
 be the “bloofer lady” is supremely funny. some of our caricaturists
 might, says, take lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the
 reality and the picture. it is only in accordance with general
 principles of human nature that the “bloofer lady” should be the popular
 rôle at these _al fresco_ performances. our correspondent naïvely says
 that even ellen terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of
 these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine
 themselves--to be.
 
there is, however, possibly serious side to the question, for some of
 the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been
 slightly torn or wounded in the throat. the wounds seem such as might be
 made by rat or small dog, and although of not much importance
 individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has
 system or method of its own. the police of the division have been
 instructed to keep sharp look-out for straying children, especially
 when very young, in and around hampstead heath, and for any stray dog
 which may be about.

the hampstead horror.
 
another child injured.
 
_the “bloofer lady.”_
 
we have just received intelligence that another child, missed last
 night, was only discovered late in the morning under furze bush at the
 shooter’s hill side of hampstead heath, which is, perhaps, less
 frequented than the other parts. it has the same tiny wound in the
 throat as has been noticed in other cases. it was terribly weak, and
 looked quite emaciated. it too, when partially restored, had the common
 story to tell of being lured away by the “bloofer lady.”
 



chapter xiv
 
mina harker’s journal
 

_23 september_.--jonathan is better after bad night. i am so glad that
 has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible
 things; and oh, i am rejoiced that is not now weighed down with the
 responsibility of his new position. i knew would be true to himself,
 and now how proud i am to see my jonathan rising to the height of his
 advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon
 him. will be away all day till late, for said could not lunch
 at home. my household work is done, so i shall take his foreign journal,
 and lock myself up in my room and read it....
 

_24 september_.--i hadn’t the heart to write last night; that terrible
 record of jonathan’s upset so. poor dear! how must have suffered,
 whether it be true or only imagination. i wonder if there is any truth
 in it at all. did get his brain fever, and then write all those
 terrible things, or had some cause for it all? i suppose i shall
 never know, for i dare not open the subject to him.... and yet that man
 we saw yesterday! seemed quite certain of him.... poor fellow! i
 suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some
 train of thought.... believes it all himself. i remember how on our
 wedding-day said: “unless some solemn duty come upon to go back to
 the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.” there seems to be
 through it all some thread of continuity.... that fearful count was
 coming to london.... if it should be, and came to london, with his
 teeming millions.... there may be solemn duty; and if it come we must
 not shrink from it.... i shall be prepared. i shall get my typewriter
 this very hour and begin transcribing. then we shall be ready for other
 eyes if required. and if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if i am ready,
 poor jonathan may not be upset, for i can speak for him and never let
 him be troubled or worried with it at all. if ever jonathan quite gets
 over the nervousness may want to tell of it all, and i can ask him
 questions and find out things, and see how i may comfort him.
 

_letter, helsing to mrs. harker._
 
“_24 september._
 
(_confidence_)
 
“dear madam,--
 
“i pray you to pardon my writing, in that i am so far friend as that i
 sent to you sad news of miss lucy westenra’s death. by the kindness of
 lord godalming, i am empowered to read her letters and papers, for i am
 deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. in them i find
 some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you
 love her. oh, madam mina, by that love, i implore you, help me. it is
 for others’ good that i ask--to redress great wrong, and to lift much
 and terrible troubles--that may be more great than you can know. may it
 be that i see you? you can trust me. i am friend of dr. john seward and
 of lord godalming (that was arthur of miss lucy). i must keep it private
 for the present from all. i should come to exeter to see you at once if
 you tell i am privilege to come, and where and when. i implore your
 pardon, madam. i have read your letters to poor lucy, and know how good
 you are and how your husband suffer; so i pray you, if it may be,
 enlighten him not, lest it may harm. again your pardon, and forgive me.
 
“van helsing.”
 

_telegram, mrs. harker to helsing._
 
“_25 september._--come to-day by quarter-past ten train if you can catch
 it. can see you any time you call.
 
“wilhelmina harker.”
 
mina harker’s journal.
 
_25 september._--i cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time
 draws near for the visit of dr. helsing, for somehow i expect that
 it will throw some light upon jonathan’s sad experience; and as he
 attended poor dear lucy in her last illness, can tell all about
 her. that is the reason of his coming; it is concerning lucy and her
 sleep-walking, and not about jonathan. then i shall never know the real
 truth now! how silly i am. that awful journal gets hold of my
 imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. of
 course it is about lucy. that habit came back to the poor dear, and that
 awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. i had almost forgotten
 in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. she must have told him
 of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that i knew all about
 it; and now wants to tell him what she knows, so that may
 understand. i hope i did right in not saying anything of it to mrs.
 westenra; i should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even
 negative one, brought harm on poor dear lucy. i hope, too, dr. van
 helsing will not blame me; i have had so much trouble and anxiety of
 late that i feel i cannot bear more just at present.
 
i suppose cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain
 does. perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and
 then jonathan went away this morning to stay away from whole day
 and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. i do
 hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
 occur to upset him. it is two o’clock, and the doctor will be here soon
 now. i shall say nothing of jonathan’s journal unless asks me. i am
 so glad i have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case asks
 about lucy, i can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--he has come and gone. oh, what strange meeting, and how it
 all makes my head whirl round! i feel like one in dream. can it be all
 possible, or even part of it? if i had not read jonathan’s journal
 first, i should never have accepted even possibility. poor, poor, dear
 jonathan! how must have suffered. please the good god, all this may
 not upset him again. i shall try to save him from it; but it may be even
 consolation and help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its
 consequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did
 not deceive him, and that it is all true. it may be that it is the doubt
 which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, matter
 which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, will be more
 satisfied and better able to bear the shock. dr. helsing must be a
 good man as well as clever one if is arthur’s friend and dr.
 seward’s, and if they brought him all the way from holland to look after
 lucy. i feel from having seen him that _is_ good and kind and of a
 noble nature. when comes to-morrow i shall ask him about jonathan;
 and then, please god, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to good
 end. i used to think i would like to practise interviewing; jonathan’s
 friend on “the exeter news” told him that memory was everything in such
 work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word
 spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. here was rare
 interview; i shall try to record it _verbatim_.
 
it was half-past two o’clock when the knock came. i took my courage _à
 deux mains_ and waited. in few minutes mary opened the door, and
 announced “dr. helsing.”
 
i rose and bowed, and came towards me; man of medium weight,
 strongly built, with his shoulders set back over broad, deep chest and
 neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. the poise
 of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the
 head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. the face,
 clean-shaven, shows hard, square chin, large, resolute, mobile
 mouth, good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive
 nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the
 mouth tightens. the forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost
 straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;
 such forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,
 but falls naturally back and to the sides. big, dark blue eyes are set
 widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man’s moods. he
 said to me:--
 
“mrs. harker, is it not?” i bowed assent.
 
“that was miss mina murray?” again i assented.
 
“it is mina murray that i came to see that was friend of that poor dear
 child lucy westenra. madam mina, it is on account of the dead i come.”
 
“sir,” i said, “you could have better claim on than that you were
 friend and helper of lucy westenra.” and i held out my hand. took
 it and said tenderly:--
 
“oh, madam mina, i knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be
 good, but i had yet to learn----” finished his speech with courtly
 bow. i asked him what it was that wanted to see about, so at
 once began:--
 
“i have read your letters to miss lucy. forgive me, but i had to begin
 to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. i know that you were
 with her at whitby. she sometimes kept diary--you need not look
 surprised, madam mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in
 imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain
 things to sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. in
 great perplexity then i come to you, and ask you out of your so much
 kindness to tell all of it that you can remember.”
 
“i can tell you, i think, dr. helsing, all about it.”
 
“ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? it is not always
 so with young ladies.”
 
“no, doctor, but i wrote it all down at the time. i can show it to you
 if you like.”
 
“oh, madam mina, i will be grateful; you will do much favour.” i
 could not resist the temptation of mystifying him bit--i suppose it is
 some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our
 mouths--so i handed him the shorthand diary. took it with grateful
 bow, and said:--
 
“may i read it?”
 
“if you wish,” i answered as demurely as i could. opened it, and for
 an instant his face fell. then stood up and bowed.
 
“oh, you so clever woman!” said. “i knew long that mr. jonathan was a
 man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.
 and will you not so much honour and so help as to read it for me?
 alas! i know not the shorthand.” by this time my little joke was over,
 and i was almost ashamed; so i took the typewritten copy from my
 workbasket and handed it to him.
 
“forgive me,” i said: “i could not help it; but i had been thinking that
 it was of dear lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not
 have time to wait--not on my account, but because i know your time must
 be precious--i have written it out on the typewriter for you.”
 
took it and his eyes glistened. “you are so good,” said. “and may
 i read it now? i may want to ask you some things when i have read.”
 
“by all means,” i said, “read it over whilst i order lunch; and then you
 can ask questions whilst we eat.” bowed and settled himself in a
 chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,
 whilst i went to see after lunch chiefly in order that might not be
 disturbed. when i came back, i found him walking hurriedly up and down
 the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. rushed up to and
 took by both hands.
 
“oh, madam mina,” said, “how can i say what i owe to you? this paper
 is as sunshine. it opens the gate to me. i am daze, i am dazzle, with so
 much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. but that
 you do not, cannot, comprehend. oh, but i am grateful to you, you so
 clever woman. madam”--he said this very solemnly--“if ever abraham van
 helsing can do anything for you or yours, i trust you will let know.
 it will be pleasure and delight if i may serve you as friend; as a
 friend, but all i have ever learned, all i can ever do, shall be for you
 and those you love. there are darknesses in life, and there are lights;
 you are one of the lights. you will have happy life and good life, and
 your husband will be blessed in you.”
 
“but, doctor, you praise too much, and--and you do not know me.”
 
“not know you--i, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and
 women; i, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to
 him and all that follow from him! and i have read your diary that you
 have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every
 line. i, who have read your so sweet letter to poor lucy of your
 marriage and your trust, not know you! oh, madam mina, good women tell
 all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that
 angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of
 angels’ eyes. your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for
 you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. and your
 husband--tell of him. is quite well? is all that fever gone, and
 is strong and hearty?” i saw here an opening to ask him about
 jonathan, so i said:--
 
“he was almost recovered, but has been greatly upset by mr. hawkins’s
 death.” interrupted:--
 
“oh, yes, i know, i know. i have read your last two letters.” i went
 on:--
 
“i suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on thursday last he
 had sort of shock.”
 
“a shock, and after brain fever so soon! that was not good. what kind of
 shock was it?”
 
“he thought saw some one who recalled something terrible, something
 which led to his brain fever.” and here the whole thing seemed to
 overwhelm in rush. the pity for jonathan, the horror which he
 experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that
 has been brooding over ever since, all came in tumult. i suppose i
 was hysterical, for i threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to
 him, and implored him to make my husband well again. took my hands
 and raised up, and made sit on the sofa, and sat by me; held my
 hand in his, and said to with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--
 
“my life is barren and lonely one, and so full of work that i have not
 had much time for friendships; but since i have been summoned to here by
 my friend john seward i have known so many good people and seen such
 nobility that i feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing
 years--the loneliness of my life. believe, me, then, that i come here
 full of respect for you, and you have given hope--hope, not in what i
 am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life
 happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for
 the children that are to be. i am glad, glad, that i may here be of some
 use to you; for if your husband suffer, suffer within the range of my
 study and experience. i promise you that i will gladly do _all_ for him
 that i can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life happy
 one. now you must eat. you are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.
 husband jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what like not
 where love, is not to his good. therefore for his sake you must eat
 and smile. you have told all about lucy, and so now we shall not
 speak of it, lest it distress. i shall stay in exeter to-night, for i
 want to think much over what you have told me, and when i have thought i
 will ask you questions, if i may. and then, too, you will tell of
 husband jonathan’s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. you must eat
 now; afterwards you shall tell all.”
 
after lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, said to me:--
 
“and now tell all about him.” when it came to speaking to this great
 learned man, i began to fear that would think weak fool, and
 jonathan madman--that journal is all so strange--and i hesitated to go
 on. but was so sweet and kind, and had promised to help, and i
 trusted him, so i said:--
 
“dr. helsing, what i have to tell you is so queer that you must not
 laugh at or at my husband. i have been since yesterday in sort of
 fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think foolish that i
 have even half believed some very strange things.” reassured by
 his manner as well as his words when said:--
 
“oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which
 i am here, it is you who would laugh. i have learned not to think little
 of any one’s belief, matter how strange it be. i have tried to keep
 an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close
 it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that
 make one doubt if they be mad or sane.”
 
“thank you, thank you, thousand times! you have taken weight off my
 mind. if you will let me, i shall give you paper to read. it is long,
 but i have typewritten it out. it will tell you my trouble and
 jonathan’s. it is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that
 happened. i dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and
 judge. and then when i see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell
 what you think.”
 
“i promise,” said as i gave him the papers; “i shall in the morning,
 so soon as i can, come to see you and your husband, if i may.”
 
“jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch
 with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which
 will leave you at paddington before eight.” was surprised at my
 knowledge of the trains off-hand, but does not know that i have made
 up all the trains to and from exeter, so that i may help jonathan in
 case is in hurry.
 
so took the papers with him and went away, and i sit here
 thinking--thinking i don’t know what.

_letter (by hand), helsing to mrs. harker._
 
“_25 september, 6 o’clock._
 
“dear madam mina,--
 
“i have read your husband’s so wonderful diary. you may sleep without
 doubt. strange and terrible as it is, it is _true_! i will pledge my
 life on it. it may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no
 dread. is noble fellow; and let tell you from experience of men,
 that one who would do as did in going down that wall and to that
 room--ay, and going second time--is not one to be injured in
 permanence by shock. his brain and his heart are all right; this i
 swear, before i have even seen him; so be at rest. i shall have much to
 ask him of other things. i am blessed that to-day i come to see you, for
 i have learn all at once so much that again i am dazzle--dazzle more
 than ever, and i must think.
 
“yours the most faithful,
 
“abraham helsing.”
 

_letter, mrs. harker to helsing._
 
“_25 september, 6:30 p. m._
 
“my dear dr. helsing,--
 
“a thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken great weight
 off my mind. and yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in
 the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really
 in london! i fear to think. i have this moment, whilst writing, had a
 wire from jonathan, saying that leaves by the 6:25 to-night from
 launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that i shall have fear
 to-night. will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come
 to breakfast at eight o’clock, if this be not too early for you? you can
 get away, if you are in hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring
 you to paddington by 2:35. do not answer this, as i shall take it that,
 if i do not hear, you will come to breakfast.
 
“believe me,
 
“your faithful and grateful friend,
 
“mina harker.”
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_26 september._--i thought never to write in this diary again, but the
 time has come. when i got home last night mina had supper ready, and
 when we had supped she told of helsing’s visit, and of her having
 given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been
 about me. she showed in the doctor’s letter that all i wrote down was
 true. it seems to have made new man of me. it was the doubt as to the
 reality of the whole thing that knocked over. i felt impotent, and in
 the dark, and distrustful. but, now that i _know_, i am not afraid, even
 of the count. has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting
 to london, and it was i saw. has got younger, and how? helsing
 is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if is anything like what
 mina says. we sat late, and talked it all over. mina is dressing, and i
 shall call at the hotel in few minutes and bring him over....
 
was, i think, surprised to see me. when i came into the room where he
 was, and introduced myself, took by the shoulder, and turned my
 face round to the light, and said, after sharp scrutiny:--
 
“but madam mina told you were ill, that you had had shock.” it was
 so funny to hear my wife called “madam mina” by this kindly,
 strong-faced old man. i smiled, and said:--
 
“i _was_ ill, i _have_ had shock; but you have cured already.”
 
“and how?”
 
“by your letter to mina last night. i was in doubt, and then everything
 took hue of unreality, and i did not know what to trust, even the
 evidence of my own senses. not knowing what to trust, i did not know
 what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been
 the groove of my life. the groove ceased to avail me, and i mistrusted
 myself. doctor, you don’t know what it is to doubt everything, even
 yourself. no, you don’t; you couldn’t with eyebrows like yours.” he
 seemed pleased, and laughed as said:--
 
“so! you are physiognomist. i learn more here with each hour. i am with
 so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will
 pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.” i
 would listen to him go on praising mina for day, so i simply nodded
 and stood silent.
 
“she is one of god’s women, fashioned by his own hand to show us men and
 other women that there is heaven where we can enter, and that its
 light can be here on earth. so true, so sweet, so noble, so little an
 egoist--and that, let tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and
 selfish. and you, sir--i have read all the letters to poor miss lucy,
 and some of them speak of you, so i know you since some days from the
 knowing of others; but i have seen your true self since last night. you
 will give your hand, will you not? and let us be friends for all our
 lives.”
 
we shook hands, and was so earnest and so kind that it made quite
 choky.
 
“and now,” said, “may i ask you for some more help? i have great
 task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. you can help here.
 can you tell what went before your going to transylvania? later on i
 may ask more help, and of different kind; but at first this will do.”
 
“look here, sir,” i said, “does what you have to do concern the count?”
 
“it does,” said solemnly.
 
“then i am with you heart and soul. as you go by the 10:30 train, you
 will not have time to read them; but i shall get the bundle of papers.
 you can take them with you and read them in the train.”
 
after breakfast i saw him to the station. when we were parting he
 said:--
 
“perhaps you will come to town if i send to you, and take madam mina
 too.”
 
“we shall both come when you will,” i said.
 
i had got him the morning papers and the london papers of the previous
 night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the
 train to start, was turning them over. his eyes suddenly seemed to
 catch something in one of them, “the westminster gazette”--i knew it by
 the colour--and grew quite white. read something intently,
 groaning to himself: “mein gott! mein gott! so soon! so soon!” i do not
 think remembered at the moment. just then the whistle blew, and
 the train moved off. this recalled him to himself, and leaned out of
 the window and waved his hand, calling out: “love to madam mina; i shall
 write so soon as ever i can.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_26 september._--truly there is such thing as finality. not week
 since i said “finis,” and yet here i am starting fresh again, or rather
 going on with the same record. until this afternoon i had cause to
 think of what is done. renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as
 ever was. was already well ahead with his fly business; and had
 just started in the spider line also; so had not been of any trouble
 to me. i had letter from arthur, written on sunday, and from it i
 gather that is bearing up wonderfully well. quincey morris is with
 him, and that is much of help, for himself is bubbling well of
 good spirits. quincey wrote line too, and from him i hear that
 arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to
 them all my mind is at rest. as for myself, i was settling down to my
 work with the enthusiasm which i used to have for it, so that i might
 fairly have said that the wound which poor lucy left on was becoming
 cicatrised. everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the
 end god only knows. i have an idea that helsing thinks knows,
 too, but will only let out enough at time to whet curiosity. he
 went to exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. to-day came
 back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o’clock,
 and thrust last night’s “westminster gazette” into my hand.
 
“what do you think of that?” asked as stood back and folded his
 arms.
 
i looked over the paper, for i really did not know what meant; but he
 took it from and pointed out paragraph about children being decoyed
 away at hampstead. it did not convey much to me, until i reached a
 passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. an
 idea struck me, and i looked up. “well?” said.
 
“it is like poor lucy’s.”
 
“and what do you make of it?”
 
“simply that there is some cause in common. whatever it was that injured
 her has injured them.” i did not quite understand his answer:--
 
“that is true indirectly, but not directly.”
 
“how do you mean, professor?” i asked. i was little inclined to take
 his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom
 from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one’s spirits--but
 when i saw his face, it sobered me. never, even in the midst of our
 despair about poor lucy, had looked more stern.
 
“tell me!” i said. “i can hazard opinion. i do not know what to
 think, and i have data on which to found conjecture.”
 
“do you mean to tell me, friend john, that you have suspicion as to
 what poor lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by
 events, but by me?”
 
“of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.”
 
“and how the blood lost or waste?” i shook my head. stepped over and
 sat down beside me, and went on:--
 
“you are clever man, friend john; you reason well, and your wit is bold;
 but you are too prejudiced. you do not let your eyes see nor your ears
 hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to
 you. do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,
 and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? but
 there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men’s
 eyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men
 have told them. ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to
 explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to
 explain. but yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,
 which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend
 to be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. i suppose now you do not
 believe in corporeal transference. no? nor in materialisation. no? nor
 in astral bodies. no? nor in the reading of thought. no? nor in
 hypnotism----”
 
“yes,” i said. “charcot has proved that pretty well.” smiled as he
 went on: “then you are satisfied as to it. yes? and of course then you
 understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great
 charcot--alas that is more!--into the very soul of the patient
 that influence. no? then, friend john, am i to take it that you
 simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion
 be blank? no? then tell me--for i am student of the brain--how you
 accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. let tell you, my
 friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which
 would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered
 electricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned
 as wizards. there are always mysteries in life. why was it that
 methuselah lived nine hundred years, and ‘old parr’ one hundred and
 sixty-nine, and yet that poor lucy, with four men’s blood in her poor
 veins, could not live even one day? for, had she live one more day, we
 could have save her. do you know all the mystery of life and death? do
 you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the
 qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? can you tell me
 why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived
 for centuries in the tower of the old spanish church and grew and grew,
 till, on descending, could drink the oil of all the church lamps? can
 you tell why in the pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that
 come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their
 veins; how in some islands of the western seas there are bats which hang
 on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant
 nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that
 it is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are
 found dead men, white as even miss lucy was?”
 
“good god, professor!” i said, starting up. “do you mean to tell that
 lucy was bitten by such bat; and that such thing is here in london
 in the nineteenth century?” waved his hand for silence, and went
 on:--
 
“can you tell why the tortoise lives more long than generations of
 men; why the elephant goes on and on till have seen dynasties; and
 why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?
 can you tell why men believe in all ages and places that there are
 some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and
 women who cannot die? we all know--because science has vouched for the
 fact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of
 years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of
 the world. can you tell how the indian fakir can make himself to die
 and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the
 corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men
 come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the indian
 fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?” here
 i interrupted him. i was getting bewildered; so crowded on my mind
 his list of nature’s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my
 imagination was getting fired. i had dim idea that was teaching me
 some lesson, as long ago used to do in his study at amsterdam; but
 used then to tell the thing, so that i could have the object of
 thought in mind all the time. but now i was without this help, yet i
 wanted to follow him, so i said:--
 
“professor, let be your pet student again. tell the thesis, so
 that i may apply your knowledge as you go on. at present i am going in
 my mind from point to point as mad man, and not sane one, follows an
 idea. i feel like novice lumbering through bog in mist, jumping
 from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without
 knowing where i am going.”
 
“that is good image,” said. “well, i shall tell you. my thesis is
 this: i want you to believe.”
 
“to believe what?”
 
“to believe in things that you cannot. let illustrate. i heard once
 of an american who so defined faith: ‘that faculty which enables us to
 believe things which we know to be untrue.’ for one, i follow that man.
 meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let little bit of
 truth check the rush of big truth, like small rock does railway
 truck. we get the small truth first. good! we keep him, and we value
 him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in
 the universe.”
 
“then you want not to let some previous conviction injure the
 receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. do i read
 your lesson aright?”
 
“ah, you are my favourite pupil still. it is worth to teach you. now
 that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to
 understand. you think then that those so small holes in the children’s
 throats were made by the same that made the hole in miss lucy?”
 
“i suppose so.” stood up and said solemnly:--
 
“then you are wrong. oh, would it were so! but alas! no. it is worse,
 far, far worse.”
 
“in god’s name, professor helsing, what do you mean?” i cried.
 
threw himself with despairing gesture into chair, and placed his
 elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as spoke:--
 
“they were made by miss lucy!”
 



chapter xv
 
dr. seward’s diary--_continued_.
 

for while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if had during her life
 struck lucy on the face. i smote the table hard and rose up as i said to
 him:--
 
“dr. helsing, are you mad?” raised his head and looked at me, and
 somehow the tenderness of his face calmed at once. “would i were!” he
 said. “madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. oh, my
 friend, why, think you, did i go so far round, why take so long to tell
 you so simple thing? was it because i hate you and have hated you all
 my life? was it because i wished to give you pain? was it that i wanted,
 now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a
 fearful death? ah no!”
 
“forgive me,” said i. went on:--
 
“my friend, it was because i wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,
 for i know you have loved that so sweet lady. but even yet i do not
 expect you to believe. it is so hard to accept at once any abstract
 truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
 believed the ‘no’ of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a
 concrete truth, and of such one as miss lucy. to-night i go to prove
 it. dare you come with me?”
 
this staggered me. man does not like to prove such truth; byron
 excepted from the category, jealousy.
 
“and prove the very truth most abhorred.”
 
saw my hesitation, and spoke:--
 
“the logic is simple, madman’s logic this time, jumping from tussock
 to tussock in misty bog. if it be not true, then proof will be relief;
 at worst it will not harm. if it be true! ah, there is the dread; yet
 very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. come,
 i tell you what i propose: first, that we go off now and see that child
 in the hospital. dr. vincent, of the north hospital, where the papers
 say the child is, is friend of mine, and i think of yours since you were
 in class at amsterdam. will let two scientists see his case, if he
 will not let two friends. we shall tell him nothing, but only that we
 wish to learn. and then----”
 
“and then?” took key from his pocket and held it up. “and then we
 spend the night, you and i, in the churchyard where lucy lies. this is
 the key that lock the tomb. i had it from the coffin-man to give to
 arthur.” my heart sank within me, for i felt that there was some fearful
 ordeal before us. i could do nothing, however, so i plucked up what
 heart i could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was
 passing....
 
we found the child awake. it had had sleep and taken some food, and
 altogether was going on well. dr. vincent took the bandage from its
 throat, and showed us the punctures. there was mistaking the
 similarity to those which had been on lucy’s throat. they were smaller,
 and the edges looked fresher; that was all. we asked vincent to what he
 attributed them, and replied that it must have been bite of some
 animal, perhaps rat; but, for his own part, was inclined to think
 that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern
 heights of london. “out of so many harmless ones,” said, “there may
 be some wild specimen from the south of more malignant species. some
 sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from
 the zoölogical gardens young one may have got loose, or one be bred
 there from vampire. these things do occur, you know. only ten days ago
 wolf got out, and was, i believe, traced up in this direction. for a
 week after, the children were playing nothing but red riding hood on the
 heath and in every alley in the place until this ‘bloofer lady’ scare
 came along, since when it has been quite gala-time with them. even
 this poor little mite, when woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he
 might go away. when she asked him why wanted to go, said wanted
 to play with the ‘bloofer lady.’”
 
“i hope,” said helsing, “that when you are sending the child home
 you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. these fancies
 to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another
 night, it would probably be fatal. but in any case i suppose you will
 not let it away for some days?”
 
“certainly not, not for week at least; longer if the wound is not
 healed.”
 
our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and
 the sun had dipped before we came out. when helsing saw how dark it
 was, said:--
 
“there is hurry. it is more late than i thought. come, let us seek
 somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.”
 
we dined at “jack straw’s castle” along with little crowd of
 bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. about ten o’clock we
 started from the inn. it was then very dark, and the scattered lamps
 made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual
 radius. the professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he
 went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, i was in quite mixup as to
 locality. as we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at
 last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse
 police going their usual suburban round. at last we reached the wall of
 the churchyard, which we climbed over. with some little difficulty--for
 it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found
 the westenra tomb. the professor took the key, opened the creaky door,
 and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned to
 precede him. there was delicious irony in the offer, in the
 courtliness of giving preference on such ghastly occasion. my
 companion followed quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after
 carefully ascertaining that the lock was falling, and not spring,
 one. in the latter case we should have been in bad plight. then he
 fumbled in his bag, and taking out matchbox and piece of candle,
 proceeded to make light. the tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed
 with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some
 days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites
 turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the
 beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured
 stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished
 brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a
 candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been
 imagined. it conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was
 not the only thing which could pass away.
 
helsing went about his work systematically. holding his candle so
 that could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm
 dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he
 made assurance of lucy’s coffin. another search in his bag, and took
 out turnscrew.
 
“what are you going to do?” i asked.
 
“to open the coffin. you shall yet be convinced.” straightway began
 taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the
 casing of lead beneath. the sight was almost too much for me. it seemed
 to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have
 stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; i actually took
 hold of his hand to stop him. only said: “you shall see,” and again
 fumbling in his bag, took out tiny fret-saw. striking the turnscrew
 through the lead with swift downward stab, which made wince, he
 made small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of
 the saw. i had expected rush of gas from the week-old corpse. we
 doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to
 such things, and i drew back towards the door. but the professor never
 stopped for moment; sawed down couple of feet along one side of
 the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. taking the
 edge of the loose flange, bent it back towards the foot of the
 coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to to
 look.
 
i drew near and looked. the coffin was empty.
 
it was certainly surprise to me, and gave considerable shock, but
 helsing was unmoved. was now more sure than ever of his ground,
 and so emboldened to proceed in his task. “are you satisfied now, friend
 john?” asked.
 
i felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within as
 i answered him:--
 
“i am satisfied that lucy’s body is not in that coffin; but that only
 proves one thing.”
 
“and what is that, friend john?”
 
“that it is not there.”
 
“that is good logic,” said, “so far as it goes. but how do you--how
 can you--account for it not being there?”
 
“perhaps body-snatcher,” i suggested. “some of the undertaker’s people
 may have stolen it.” i felt that i was speaking folly, and yet it was
 the only real cause which i could suggest. the professor sighed. “ah
 well!” said, “we must have more proof. come with me.”
 
put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed
 them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the
 bag. we opened the door, and went out. behind us closed the door and
 locked it. handed the key, saying: “will you keep it? you had
 better be assured.” i laughed--it was not very cheerful laugh, i am
 bound to say--as i motioned him to keep it. “a key is nothing,” i said;
 “there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick lock
 of that kind.” said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. then he
 told to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst would watch at
 the other. i took up my place behind yew-tree, and i saw his dark
 figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my
 sight.
 
it was lonely vigil. just after i had taken my place i heard distant
 clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. i was chilled and
 unnerved, and angry with the professor for taking on such an errand
 and with myself for coming. i was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly
 observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether i had
 dreary, miserable time.
 
suddenly, as i turned round, i thought i saw something like white
 streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard
 farthest from the tomb; at the same time dark mass moved from the
 professor’s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. then i
 too moved; but i had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and i
 stumbled over graves. the sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an
 early cock crew. little way off, beyond line of scattered
 juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, white, dim
 figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. the tomb itself was hidden
 by trees, and i could not see where the figure disappeared. i heard the
 rustle of actual movement where i had first seen the white figure, and
 coming over, found the professor holding in his arms tiny child. when
 saw held it out to me, and said:--
 
“are you satisfied now?”
 
“no,” i said, in way that i felt was aggressive.
 
“do you not see the child?”
 
“yes, it is child, but who brought it here? and is it wounded?” i
 asked.
 
“we shall see,” said the professor, and with one impulse we took our way
 out of the churchyard, carrying the sleeping child.
 
when we had got some little distance away, we went into clump of
 trees, and struck match, and looked at the child’s throat. it was
 without scratch or scar of any kind.
 
“was i right?” i asked triumphantly.
 
“we were just in time,” said the professor thankfully.
 
we had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted
 about it. if we were to take it to police-station we should have to
 give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should
 have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.
 so finally we decided that we would take it to the heath, and when we
 heard policeman coming, would leave it where could not fail to find
 it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. all fell out
 well. at the edge of hampstead heath we heard policeman’s heavy
 tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until
 saw it as flashed his lantern to and fro. we heard his exclamation
 of astonishment, and then we went away silently. by good chance we got a
 cab near the “spaniards,” and drove to town.
 
i cannot sleep, so i make this entry. but i must try to get few hours’
 sleep, as helsing is to call for at noon. insists that i shall
 go with him on another expedition.
 
* * * * *
 
_27 september._--it was two o’clock before we found suitable
 opportunity for our attempt. the funeral held at noon was all completed,
 and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily
 away, when, looking carefully from behind clump of alder-trees, we saw
 the sexton lock the gate after him. we knew then that we were safe till
 morning did we desire it; but the professor told that we should not
 want more than an hour at most. again i felt that horrid sense of the
 reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of
 place; and i realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were
 incurring in our unhallowed work. besides, i felt it was all so useless.
 outrageous as it was to open leaden coffin, to see if woman dead
 nearly week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to
 open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own
 eyesight, that the coffin was empty. i shrugged my shoulders, however,
 and rested silent, for helsing had way of going on his own road,
 matter who remonstrated. took the key, opened the vault, and again
 courteously motioned to precede. the place was not so gruesome as
 last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine
 streamed in. helsing walked over to lucy’s coffin, and i followed.
 bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then shock
 of surprise and dismay shot through me.
 
there lay lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her
 funeral. she was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and i
 could not believe that she was dead. the lips were red, nay redder than
 before; and on the cheeks was delicate bloom.
 
“is this juggle?” i said to him.
 
“are you convinced now?” said the professor in response, and as spoke
 put over his hand, and in way that made shudder, pulled back the
 dead lips and showed the white teeth.
 
“see,” went on, “see, they are even sharper than before. with this
 and this”--and touched one of the canine teeth and that below
 it--“the little children can be bitten. are you of belief now, friend
 john?” once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. i _could_ not
 accept such an overwhelming idea as suggested; so, with an attempt to
 argue of which i was even at the moment ashamed, i said:--
 
“she may have been placed here since last night.”
 
“indeed? that is so, and by whom?”
 
“i do not know. some one has done it.”
 
“and yet she has been dead one week. most peoples in that time would not
 look so.” i had answer for this, so was silent. helsing did not
 seem to notice my silence; at any rate, showed neither chagrin nor
 triumph. was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising
 the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and
 examining the teeth. then turned to and said:--
 
“here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is
 some dual life that is not as the common. she was bitten by the vampire
 when she was in trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know
 that, friend john, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could
 best come to take more blood. in trance she died, and in trance she
 is un-dead, too. so it is that she differ from all other. usually when
 the un-dead sleep at home”--as spoke made comprehensive sweep of
 his arm to designate what to vampire was “home”--“their face show what
 they are, but this so sweet that was when she not un-dead she go back to
 the nothings of the common dead. there is malign there, see, and so
 it make hard that i must kill her in her sleep.” this turned my blood
 cold, and it began to dawn upon that i was accepting helsing’s
 theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the
 idea of killing her? looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in
 my face, for said almost joyously:--
 
“ah, you believe now?”
 
i answered: “do not press too hard all at once. i am willing to
 accept. how will you do this bloody work?”
 
“i shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and i shall
 drive stake through her body.” it made shudder to think of so
 mutilating the body of the woman whom i had loved. and yet the feeling
 was not so strong as i had expected. i was, in fact, beginning to
 shudder at the presence of this being, this un-dead, as helsing
 called it, and to loathe it. is it possible that love is all subjective,
 or all objective?
 
i waited considerable time for helsing to begin, but stood as
 if wrapped in thought. presently closed the catch of his bag with a
 snap, and said:--
 
“i have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. if i
 did simply follow my inclining i would do now, at this moment, what is
 to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are
 thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. this is
 simple. she have yet life taken, though that is of time; and to act
 now would be to take danger from her for ever. but then we may have to
 want arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? if you, who saw the
 wounds on lucy’s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child’s at
 the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full
 to-day with woman who have not change only to be more rose and more
 beautiful in whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know
 of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,
 and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can i expect
 arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? doubted when i
 took him from her kiss when she was dying. i know has forgiven me
 because in some mistaken idea i have done things that prevent him say
 good-bye as ought; and may think that in some more mistaken idea
 this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have
 killed her. will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that
 have killed her by our ideas; and so will be much unhappy always. yet
 never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. and will
 sometimes think that she loved was buried alive, and that will paint
 his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he
 will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,
 an un-dead. no! i told him once, and since then i learn much. now, since
 i know it is all true, hundred thousand times more do i know that he
 must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. he, poor fellow,
 must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to
 him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. my mind is
 made up. let us go. you return home for to-night to your asylum, and see
 that all be well. as for me, i shall spend the night here in this
 churchyard in my own way. to-morrow night you will come to to the
 berkeley hotel at ten of the clock. i shall send for arthur to come too,
 and also that so fine young man of america that gave his blood. later we
 shall all have work to do. i come with you so far as piccadilly and
 there dine, for i must be back here before the sun set.”
 
so we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the
 churchyard, which was not much of task, and drove back to piccadilly.

“_27 september._
 
“friend john,--
 
“i write this in case anything should happen. i go alone to watch in
 that churchyard. it pleases that the un-dead, miss lucy, shall not
 leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.
 therefore i shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a
 crucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. she is young as un-dead,
 and will heed. moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they
 may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the un-dead is
 desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may
 be. i shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,
 and if there be aught that may be learned i shall learn it. for miss
 lucy or from her, i have fear; but that other to whom is there that
 she is un-dead, have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.
 is cunning, as i know from mr. jonathan and from the way that all
 along have fooled us when played with us for miss lucy’s life, and
 we lost; and in many ways the un-dead are strong. have always the
 strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength
 to miss lucy it also is all to him. besides, can summon his wolf and
 i know not what. so if it be that come thither on this night shall
 find me; but none other shall--until it be too late. but it may be that
 will not attempt the place. there is reason why should; his
 hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the
 un-dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.
 
“therefore i write this in case.... take the papers that are with this,
 the diaries of harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this
 great un-dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive stake
 through it, so that the world may rest from him.
 
“if it be so, farewell.
 
“van helsing.”
 


_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_28 september._--it is wonderful what good night’s sleep will do for
 one. yesterday i was almost willing to accept helsing’s monstrous
 ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before as outrages on
 common sense. i have doubt that believes it all. i wonder if his
 mind can have become in any way unhinged. surely there must be _some_
 rational explanation of all these mysterious things. is it possible that
 the professor can have done it himself? is so abnormally clever that
 if went off his head would carry out his intent with regard to
 some fixed idea in wonderful way. i am loath to think it, and indeed
 it would be almost as great marvel as the other to find that van
 helsing was mad; but anyhow i shall watch him carefully. i may get some
 light on the mystery.
 
* * * * *
 
_29 september, morning._.... last night, at little before ten o’clock,
 arthur and quincey came into helsing’s room; told us all that he
 wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to arthur, as if all
 our wills were centred in his. began by saying that hoped we would
 all come with him too, “for,” said, “there is grave duty to be done
 there. you were doubtless surprised at my letter?” this query was
 directly addressed to lord godalming.
 
“i was. it rather upset for bit. there has been so much trouble
 around my house of late that i could do without any more. i have been
 curious, too, as to what you mean. quincey and i talked it over; but the
 more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now i can say for myself
 that i’m about up tree as to any meaning about anything.”
 
“me too,” said quincey morris laconically.
 
“oh,” said the professor, “then you are nearer the beginning, both of
 you, than friend john here, who has to go long way back before can
 even get so far as to begin.”
 
it was evident that recognised my return to my old doubting frame of
 mind without my saying word. then, turning to the other two, said
 with intense gravity:--
 
“i want your permission to do what i think good this night. it is, i
 know, much to ask; and when you know what it is i propose to do you will
 know, and only then, how much. therefore may i ask that you promise me
 in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with for a
 time--i must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may
 be--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.”
 
“that’s frank anyhow,” broke in quincey. “i’ll answer for the professor.
 i don’t quite see his drift, but i swear he’s honest; and that’s good
 enough for me.”
 
“i thank you, sir,” said helsing proudly. “i have done myself the
 honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear
 to me.” held out hand, which quincey took.
 
then arthur spoke out:--
 
“dr. helsing, i don’t quite like to ‘buy pig in poke,’ as they
 say in scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as gentleman
 or my faith as christian is concerned, i cannot make such promise.
 if you can assure that what you intend does not violate either of
 these two, then i give my consent at once; though for the life of me, i
 cannot understand what you are driving at.”
 
“i accept your limitation,” said helsing, “and all i ask of you is
 that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first
 consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your
 reservations.”
 
“agreed!” said arthur; “that is only fair. and now that the
 _pourparlers_ are over, may i ask what it is we are to do?”
 
“i want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at
 kingstead.”
 
arthur’s face fell as said in an amazed sort of way:--
 
“where poor lucy is buried?” the professor bowed. arthur went on: “and
 when there?”
 
“to enter the tomb!” arthur stood up.
 
“professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? pardon me,
 i see that you are in earnest.” sat down again, but i could see that
 sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. there was
 silence until asked again:--
 
“and when in the tomb?”
 
“to open the coffin.”
 
“this is too much!” said, angrily rising again. “i am willing to be
 patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration
 of the grave--of one who----” fairly choked with indignation. the
 professor looked pityingly at him.
 
“if i could spare you one pang, my poor friend,” said, “god knows i
 would. but this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and
 for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!”
 
arthur looked up with set white face and said:--
 
“take care, sir, take care!”
 
“would it not be well to hear what i have to say?” said helsing.
 “and then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. shall i go
 on?”
 
“that’s fair enough,” broke in morris.
 
after pause helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--
 
“miss lucy is dead; is it not so? yes! then there can be wrong to
 her. but if she be not dead----”
 
arthur jumped to his feet.
 
“good god!” cried. “what do you mean? has there been any mistake; has
 she been buried alive?” groaned in anguish that not even hope could
 soften.
 
“i did not say she was alive, my child; i did not think it. i go no
 further than to say that she might be un-dead.”
 
“un-dead! not alive! what do you mean? is this all nightmare, or what
 is it?”
 
“there are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they
 may solve only in part. believe me, we are now on the verge of one. but
 i have not done. may i cut off the head of dead miss lucy?”
 
“heavens and earth, no!” cried arthur in storm of passion. “not for
 the wide world will i consent to any mutilation of her dead body. dr.
 helsing, you try too far. what have i done to you that you should
 torture so? what did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to
 cast such dishonour on her grave? are you mad to speak such things, or
 am i mad to listen to them? don’t dare to think more of such a
 desecration; i shall not give my consent to anything you do. i have a
 duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by god, i shall do
 it!”
 
helsing rose up from where had all the time been seated, and
 said, gravely and sternly:--
 
“my lord godalming, i, too, have duty to do, duty to others, duty
 to you, duty to the dead; and, by god, i shall do it! all i ask you
 now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when
 later i make the same request you do not be more eager for its
 fulfilment even than i am, then--then i shall do my duty, whatever it
 may seem to me. and then, to follow of your lordship’s wishes i shall
 hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where
 you will.” his voice broke little, and went on with voice full of
 pity:--
 
“but, i beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. in long life of
 acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring
 my heart, i have never had so heavy task as now. believe that if
 the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from
 you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for i would do what man can
 to save you from sorrow. just think. for why should i give myself so
 much of labour and so much of sorrow? i have come here from my own land
 to do what i can of good; at the first to please my friend john, and
 then to help sweet young lady, whom, too, i came to love. for her--i
 am ashamed to say so much, but i say it in kindness--i gave what you
 gave; the blood of my veins; i gave it, i, who was not, like you, her
 lover, but only her physician and her friend. i gave to her my nights
 and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good
 even now, when she is the dead un-dead, she shall have it freely.” he
 said this with very grave, sweet pride, and arthur was much affected
 by it. took the old man’s hand and said in broken voice:--
 
“oh, it is hard to think of it, and i cannot understand; but at least i
 shall go with you and wait.”
 



chapter xvi
 
dr. seward’s diary--_continued_
 

it was just quarter before twelve o’clock when we got into the
 churchyard over the low wall. the night was dark with occasional gleams
 of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across
 the sky. we all kept somehow close together, with helsing slightly
 in front as led the way. when we had come close to the tomb i looked
 well at arthur, for i feared that the proximity to place laden with so
 sorrowful memory would upset him; but bore himself well. i took it
 that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way counteractant
 to his grief. the professor unlocked the door, and seeing natural
 hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by
 entering first himself. the rest of us followed, and closed the door.
 then lit dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. arthur stepped
 forward hesitatingly; helsing said to me:--
 
“you were with here yesterday. was the body of miss lucy in that
 coffin?”
 
“it was.” the professor turned to the rest saying:--
 
“you hear; and yet there is one who does not believe with me.” he
 took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. arthur
 looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed stepped
 forward. evidently did not know that there was leaden coffin, or,
 at any rate, had not thought of it. when saw the rent in the lead,
 the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away
 again, so that remained of ghastly whiteness; was still silent.
 helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and
 recoiled.
 
the coffin was empty!
 
for several minutes one spoke word. the silence was broken by
 quincey morris:--
 
“professor, i answered for you. your word is all i want. i wouldn’t ask
 such thing ordinarily--i wouldn’t so dishonour you as to imply a
 doubt; but this is mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.
 is this your doing?”
 
“i swear to you by all that i hold sacred that i have not removed nor
 touched her. what happened was this: two nights ago my friend seward and
 i came here--with good purpose, believe me. i opened that coffin, which
 was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. we then waited, and
 saw something white come through the trees. the next day we came here in
 day-time, and she lay there. did she not, friend john?”
 
“yes.”
 
“that night we were just in time. one more so small child was missing,
 and we find it, thank god, unharmed amongst the graves. yesterday i came
 here before sundown, for at sundown the un-dead can move. i waited here
 all the night till the sun rose, but i saw nothing. it was most probable
 that it was because i had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,
 which the un-dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. last
 night there was exodus, so to-night before the sundown i took away my
 garlic and other things. and so it is we find this coffin empty. but
 bear with me. so far there is much that is strange. wait you with me
 outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.
 so”--here shut the dark slide of his lantern--“now to the outside.”
 opened the door, and we filed out, coming last and locking the
 door behind him.
 
oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of
 that vault. how sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing
 gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and
 passing--like the gladness and sorrow of man’s life; how sweet it was
 to breathe the fresh air, that had taint of death and decay; how
 humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to
 hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of great city. each
 in his own way was solemn and overcome. arthur was silent, and was, i
 could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the
 mystery. i was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to
 throw aside doubt and to accept helsing’s conclusions. quincey
 morris was phlegmatic in the way of man who accepts all things, and
 accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all has to
 stake. not being able to smoke, cut himself good-sized plug of
 tobacco and began to chew. as to helsing, was employed in a
 definite way. first took from his bag mass of what looked like
 thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in white
 napkin; next took out double-handful of some whitish stuff, like
 dough or putty. crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the
 mass between his hands. this then took, and rolling it into thin
 strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its
 setting in the tomb. i was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,
 asked him what it was that was doing. arthur and quincey drew near
 also, as they too were curious. answered:--
 
“i am closing the tomb, so that the un-dead may not enter.”
 
“and is that stuff you have put there going to do it?” asked quincey.
 “great scott! is this game?”
 
“it is.”
 
“what is that which you are using?” this time the question was by
 arthur. helsing reverently lifted his hat as answered:--
 
“the host. i brought it from amsterdam. i have an indulgence.” it was an
 answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually
 that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the professor’s, a
 purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was
 impossible to distrust. in respectful silence we took the places
 assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any
 one approaching. i pitied the others, especially arthur. i had myself
 been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet i,
 who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink
 within me. never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or
 yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree
 or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so
 mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a
 woeful presage through the night.
 
there was long spell of silence, big, aching void, and then from the
 professor keen “s-s-s-s!” pointed; and far down the avenue of yews
 we saw white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something
 dark at its breast. the figure stopped, and at the moment ray of
 moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling
 prominence dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.
 we could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a
 fair-haired child. there was pause and sharp little cry, such as a
 child gives in sleep, or dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. we
 were starting forward, but the professor’s warning hand, seen by us as
 stood behind yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the
 white figure moved forwards again. it was now near enough for us to see
 clearly, and the moonlight still held. my own heart grew cold as ice,
 and i could hear the gasp of arthur, as we recognised the features of
 lucy westenra. lucy westenra, but yet how changed. the sweetness was
 turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous
 wantonness. helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we
 all advanced too; the four of us ranged in line before the door of the
 tomb. helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the
 concentrated light that fell on lucy’s face we could see that the lips
 were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her
 chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.
 
we shuddered with horror. i could see by the tremulous light that even
 helsing’s iron nerve had failed. arthur was next to me, and if i had
 not seized his arm and held him up, would have fallen.
 
when lucy--i call the thing that was before us lucy because it bore her
 shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as cat gives
 when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. lucy’s eyes in form
 and colour; but lucy’s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of
 the pure, gentle orbs we knew. at that moment the remnant of my love
 passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, i could have
 done it with savage delight. as she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy
 light, and the face became wreathed with voluptuous smile. oh, god,
 how it made shudder to see it! with careless motion, she flung to
 the ground, callous as devil, the child that up to now she had
 clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as dog growls
 over bone. the child gave sharp cry, and lay there moaning. there
 was cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung groan from arthur; when
 she advanced to him with outstretched arms and wanton smile fell
 back and hid his face in his hands.
 
she still advanced, however, and with languorous, voluptuous grace,
 said:--
 
“come to me, arthur. leave these others and come to me. my arms are
 hungry for you. come, and we can rest together. come, my husband, come!”
 
there was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the
 tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us
 who heard the words addressed to another. as for arthur, seemed under
 spell; moving his hands from his face, opened wide his arms. she
 was leaping for them, when helsing sprang forward and held between
 them his little golden crucifix. she recoiled from it, and, with a
 suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter
 the tomb.
 
when within foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if
 arrested by some irresistible force. then she turned, and her face was
 shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no
 quiver from helsing’s iron nerves. never did i see such baffled
 malice on face; and never, i trust, shall such ever be seen again by
 mortal eyes. the beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw
 out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of
 the flesh were the coils of medusa’s snakes, and the lovely,
 blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of
 the greeks and japanese. if ever face meant death--if looks could
 kill--we saw it at that moment.
 
and so for full half minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained
 between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of
 entry. helsing broke the silence by asking arthur:--
 
“answer me, oh my friend! am i to proceed in my work?”
 
arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he
 answered:--
 
“do as you will, friend; do as you will. there can be horror like
 this ever any more;” and groaned in spirit. quincey and i
 simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. we could hear the
 click of the closing lantern as helsing held it down; coming close
 to the tomb, began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred
 emblem which had placed there. we all looked on in horrified
 amazement as we saw, when stood back, the woman, with corporeal
 body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice
 where scarce knife-blade could have gone. we all felt glad sense of
 relief when we saw the professor calmly restoring the strings of putty
 to the edges of the door.
 
when this was done, lifted the child and said:
 
“come now, my friends; we can do more till to-morrow. there is a
 funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. the
 friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock
 the gate we shall remain. then there is more to do; but not like this of
 to-night. as for this little one, is not much harm, and by to-morrow
 night shall be well. we shall leave him where the police will find
 him, as on the other night; and then to home.” coming close to arthur,
 said:--
 
“my friend arthur, you have had sore trial; but after, when you look
 back, you will see how it was necessary. you are now in the bitter
 waters, my child. by this time to-morrow you will, please god, have
 passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn
 overmuch. till then i shall not ask you to forgive me.”
 
arthur and quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other
 on the way. we had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all
 slept with more or less reality of sleep.
 
* * * * *
 
_29 september, night._--a little before twelve o’clock we three--arthur,
 quincey morris, and myself--called for the professor. it was odd to
 notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. of
 course, arthur wore black, for was in deep mourning, but the rest of
 us wore it by instinct. we got to the churchyard by half-past one, and
 strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the
 gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief
 that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to
 ourselves. helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a
 long leather one, something like cricketing bag; it was manifestly of
 fair weight.
 
when we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up
 the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the
 professor to the tomb. unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it
 behind us. then took from his bag the lantern, which lit, and also
 two wax candles, which, when lighted, stuck, by melting their own
 ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work
 by. when again lifted the lid off lucy’s coffin we all looked--arthur
 trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its
 death-beauty. but there was love in my own heart, nothing but
 loathing for the foul thing which had taken lucy’s shape without her
 soul. i could see even arthur’s face grow hard as looked. presently
 said to helsing:--
 
“is this really lucy’s body, or only demon in her shape?”
 
“it is her body, and yet not it. but wait while, and you all see her
 as she was, and is.”
 
she seemed like nightmare of lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,
 the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to
 see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
 devilish mockery of lucy’s sweet purity. helsing, with his usual
 methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and
 placing them ready for use. first took out soldering iron and some
 plumbing solder, and then small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in
 corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with blue
 flame; then his operating knives, which placed to hand; and last a
 round wooden stake, some two and half or three inches thick and about
 three feet long. one end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and
 was sharpened to fine point. with this stake came heavy hammer, such
 as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. to
 me, doctor’s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and
 bracing, but the effect of these things on both arthur and quincey was
 to cause them sort of consternation. they both, however, kept their
 courage, and remained silent and quiet.
 
when all was ready, helsing said:--
 
“before we do anything, let tell you this; it is out of the lore and
 experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers
 of the un-dead. when they become such, there comes with the change the
 curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age
 adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that
 die from the preying of the un-dead becomes themselves un-dead, and prey
 on their kind. and so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the
 ripples from stone thrown in the water. friend arthur, if you had met
 that kiss which you know of before poor lucy die; or again, last night
 when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,
 have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in eastern europe, and would
 all time make more of those un-deads that so have fill us with horror.
 the career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. those
 children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if
 she live on, un-dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her
 power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that
 so wicked mouth. but if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny
 wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays
 unknowing ever of what has been. but of the most blessed of all, when
 this now un-dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor
 lady whom we love shall again be free. instead of working wickedness by
 night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she
 shall take her place with the other angels. so that, my friend, it will
 be blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.
 to this i am willing; but is there none amongst us who has better
 right? will it be joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the
 night when sleep is not: ‘it was my hand that sent her to the stars; it
 was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would
 herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?’ tell if there be
 such one amongst us?”
 
we all looked at arthur. saw, too, what we all did, the infinite
 kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore
 lucy to us as holy, and not an unholy, memory; stepped forward and
 said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as
 snow:--
 
“my true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart i thank you. tell me
 what i am to do, and i shall not falter!” helsing laid hand on his
 shoulder, and said:--
 
“brave lad! moment’s courage, and it is done. this stake must be
 driven through her. it will be fearful ordeal--be not deceived in
 that--but it will be only short time, and you will then rejoice more
 than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though
 you tread on air. but you must not falter when once you have begun. only
 think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for
 you all the time.”
 
“go on,” said arthur hoarsely. “tell what i am to do.”
 
“take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the
 heart, and the hammer in your right. then when we begin our prayer for
 the dead--i shall read him, i have here the book, and the others shall
 follow--strike in god’s name, that so all may be well with the dead that
 we love and that the un-dead pass away.”
 
arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on
 action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. helsing opened
 his missal and began to read, and quincey and i followed as well as we
 could. arthur placed the point over the heart, and as i looked i could
 see its dint in the white flesh. then struck with all his might.
 
the thing in the coffin writhed; and hideous, blood-curdling screech
 came from the opened red lips. the body shook and quivered and twisted
 in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the
 lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with crimson foam. but arthur
 never faltered. looked like figure of thor as his untrembling arm
 rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst
 the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. his
 face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it
 gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little
 vault.
 
and then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the
 teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. finally it lay still. the
 terrible task was over.
 
the hammer fell from arthur’s hand. reeled and would have fallen had
 we not caught him. the great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,
 and his breath came in broken gasps. it had indeed been an awful strain
 on him; and had not been forced to his task by more than human
 considerations could never have gone through with it. for few
 minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the
 coffin. when we did, however, murmur of startled surprise ran from one
 to the other of us. we gazed so eagerly that arthur rose, for had
 been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then glad,
 strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of
 horror that lay upon it.
 
there, in the coffin lay longer the foul thing that we had so dreaded
 and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a
 privilege to the one best entitled to it, but lucy as we had seen her in
 her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. true that
 there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and
 pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth
 to what we knew. one and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like
 sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and
 symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.
 
helsing came and laid his hand on arthur’s shoulder, and said to
 him:--
 
“and now, arthur my friend, dear lad, am i not forgiven?”
 
the reaction of the terrible strain came as took the old man’s hand
 in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--
 
“forgiven! god bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,
 and peace.” put his hands on the professor’s shoulder, and laying
 his head on his breast, cried for while silently, whilst we stood
 unmoving. when raised his head helsing said to him:--
 
“and now, my child, you may kiss her. kiss her dead lips if you will, as
 she would have you to, if for her to choose. for she is not grinning
 devil now--not any more foul thing for all eternity. longer she is
 the devil’s un-dead. she is god’s true dead, whose soul is with him!”
 
arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and quincey out of the
 tomb; the professor and i sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point
 of it in the body. then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with
 garlic. we soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,
 and gathering up our belongings, came away. when the professor locked
 the door gave the key to arthur.
 
outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it
 seemed as if all nature were tuned to different pitch. there was
 gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves
 on one account, and we were glad, though it was with tempered joy.
 
before we moved away helsing said:--
 
“now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing
 to ourselves. but there remains greater task: to find out the author
 of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. i have clues which we can
 follow; but it is long task, and difficult, and there is danger in
 it, and pain. shall you not all help me? we have learned to believe, all
 of us--is it not so? and since so, do we not see our duty? yes! and do
 we not promise to go on to the bitter end?”
 
each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. then said the
 professor as we moved off:--
 
“two nights hence you shall meet with and dine together at seven of
 the clock with friend john. i shall entreat two others, two that you
 know not as yet; and i shall be ready to all our work show and our plans
 unfold. friend john, you come with home, for i have much to consult
 about, and you can help me. to-night i leave for amsterdam, but shall
 return to-morrow night. and then begins our great quest. but first i
 shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.
 then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a
 terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we
 must not draw back.”
 



chapter xvii
 
dr. seward’s diary--_continued_
 

when we arrived at the berkeley hotel, helsing found telegram
 waiting for him:--
 
“am coming up by train. jonathan at whitby. important news.--mina
 harker.”
 
the professor was delighted. “ah, that wonderful madam mina,” said,
 “pearl among women! she arrive, but i cannot stay. she must go to your
 house, friend john. you must meet her at the station. telegraph her _en
 route_, so that she may be prepared.”
 
when the wire was despatched had cup of tea; over it told of
 diary kept by jonathan harker when abroad, and gave typewritten
 copy of it, as also of mrs. harker’s diary at whitby. “take these,” he
 said, “and study them well. when i have returned you will be master of
 all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. keep
 them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. you will need all your
 faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. what
 is here told,” laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of
 papers as spoke, “may be the beginning of the end to you and and
 many another; or it may sound the knell of the un-dead who walk the
 earth. read all, i pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in
 any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. you have
 kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? yes! then we
 shall go through all these together when we meet.” then made ready
 for his departure, and shortly after drove off to liverpool street. i
 took my way to paddington, where i arrived about fifteen minutes before
 the train came in.
 
the crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival
 platforms; and i was beginning to feel uneasy, lest i might miss my
 guest, when sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,
 after quick glance, said: “dr. seward, is it not?”
 
“and you are mrs. harker!” i answered at once; whereupon she held out
 her hand.
 
“i knew you from the description of poor dear lucy; but----” she stopped
 suddenly, and quick blush overspread her face.
 
the blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it
 was tacit answer to her own. i got her luggage, which included a
 typewriter, and we took the underground to fenchurch street, after i had
 sent wire to my housekeeper to have sitting-room and bedroom
 prepared at once for mrs. harker.
 
in due time we arrived. she knew, of course, that the place was a
 lunatic asylum, but i could see that she was unable to repress shudder
 when we entered.
 
she told that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as
 she had much to say. so here i am finishing my entry in my phonograph
 diary whilst i await her. as yet i have not had the chance of looking at
 the papers which helsing left with me, though they lie open before
 me. i must get her interested in something, so that i may have an
 opportunity of reading them. she does not know how precious time is, or
 what task we have in hand. i must be careful not to frighten her. here
 she is!
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_29 september._--after i had tidied myself, i went down to dr. seward’s
 study. at the door i paused moment, for i thought i heard him talking
 with some one. as, however, had pressed to be quick, i knocked at
 the door, and on his calling out, “come in,” i entered.
 
to my intense surprise, there was one with him. was quite alone,
 and on the table opposite him was what i knew at once from the
 description to be phonograph. i had never seen one, and was much
 interested.
 
“i hope i did not keep you waiting,” i said; “but i stayed at the door
 as i heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.”
 
“oh,” replied with smile, “i was only entering my diary.”
 
“your diary?” i asked him in surprise.
 
“yes,” answered. “i keep it in this.” as spoke laid his hand on
 the phonograph. i felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--
 
“why, this beats even shorthand! may i hear it say something?”
 
“certainly,” replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train
 for speaking. then paused, and troubled look overspread his face.
 
“the fact is,” began awkwardly, “i only keep my diary in it; and as
 it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that
 is, i mean----” stopped, and i tried to help him out of his
 embarrassment:--
 
“you helped to attend dear lucy at the end. let hear how she died;
 for all that i know of her, i shall be very grateful. she was very, very
 dear to me.”
 
to my surprise, answered, with horrorstruck look in his face:--
 
“tell you of her death? not for the wide world!”
 
“why not?” i asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.
 again paused, and i could see that was trying to invent an excuse.
 at length stammered out:--
 
“you see, i do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
 diary.” even while was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and said
 with unconscious simplicity, in different voice, and with the naïveté
 of child: “that’s quite true, upon my honour. honest indian!” i could
 not but smile, at which grimaced. “i gave myself away that time!” he
 said. “but do you know that, although i have kept the diary for months
 past, it never once struck how i was going to find any particular
 part of it in case i wanted to look it up?” by this time my mind was
 made up that the diary of doctor who attended lucy might have
 something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible being, and
 i said boldly:--
 
“then, dr. seward, you had better let copy it out for you on my
 typewriter.” grew to positively deathly pallor as said:--
 
“no! no! no! for all the world, i wouldn’t let you know that terrible
 story!”
 
then it was terrible; my intuition was right! for moment i thought,
 and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or
 some opportunity to aid me, they lit on great batch of typewriting on
 the table. his eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,
 followed their direction. as they saw the parcel realised my meaning.
 
“you do not know me,” i said. “when you have read those papers--my own
 diary and my husband’s also, which i have typed--you will know me
 better. i have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in
 this cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and i must not
 expect you to trust so far.”
 
is certainly man of noble nature; poor dear lucy was right about
 him. stood up and opened large drawer, in which were arranged in
 order number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and
 said:--
 
“you are quite right. i did not trust you because i did not know you.
 but i know you now; and let say that i should have known you long
 ago. i know that lucy told you of me; she told of you too. may i make
 the only atonement in my power? take the cylinders and hear them--the
 first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify
 you; then you will know better. dinner will by then be ready. in the
 meantime i shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better
 able to understand certain things.” carried the phonograph himself up
 to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. now i shall learn something
 pleasant, i am sure; for it will tell the other side of true love
 episode of which i know one side already....
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_29 september._--i was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of jonathan
 harker and that other of his wife that i let the time run on without
 thinking. mrs. harker was not down when the maid came to announce
 dinner, so i said: “she is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,” and
 i went on with my work. i had just finished mrs. harker’s diary, when
 she came in. she looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were
 flushed with crying. this somehow moved much. of late i have had
 cause for tears, god knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and
 now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went
 straight to my heart. so i said as gently as i could:--
 
“i greatly fear i have distressed you.”
 
“oh, no, not distressed me,” she replied, “but i have been more touched
 than i can say by your grief. that is wonderful machine, but it is
 cruelly true. it told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.
 it was like soul crying out to almighty god. one must hear them
 spoken ever again! see, i have tried to be useful. i have copied out the
 words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as
 i did.”
 
“no one need ever know, shall ever know,” i said in low voice. she
 laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--
 
“ah, but they must!”
 
“must! but why?” i asked.
 
“because it is part of the terrible story, part of poor dear lucy’s
 death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have
 before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all
 the knowledge and all the help which we can get. i think that the
 cylinders which you gave contained more than you intended to know;
 but i can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark
 mystery. you will let help, will you not? i know all up to certain
 point; and i see already, though your diary only took to 7 september,
 how poor lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought
 out. jonathan and i have been working day and night since professor van
 helsing saw us. is gone to whitby to get more information, and he
 will be here to-morrow to help us. we need have secrets amongst us;
 working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than
 if some of us were in the dark.” she looked at so appealingly, and at
 the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,
 that i gave in at once to her wishes. “you shall,” i said, “do as you
 like in the matter. god forgive if i do wrong! there are terrible
 things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to
 poor lucy’s death, you will not be content, i know, to remain in the
 dark. nay, the end--the very end--may give you gleam of peace. come,
 there is dinner. we must keep one another strong for what is before us;
 we have cruel and dreadful task. when you have eaten you shall learn
 the rest, and i shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything
 which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were
 present.”
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_29 september._--after dinner i came with dr. seward to his study. he
 brought back the phonograph from my room, and i took my typewriter. he
 placed in comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that i
 could touch it without getting up, and showed how to stop it in case
 i should want to pause. then very thoughtfully took chair, with his
 back to me, so that i might be as free as possible, and began to read. i
 put the forked metal to my ears and listened.
 
when the terrible story of lucy’s death, and--and all that followed, was
 done, i lay back in my chair powerless. fortunately i am not of a
 fainting disposition. when dr. seward saw jumped up with a
 horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking case-bottle from a
 cupboard, gave some brandy, which in few minutes somewhat restored
 me. my brain was all in whirl, and only that there came through all
 the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear lucy
 was at last at peace, i do not think i could have borne it without
 making scene. it is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if i
 had not known jonathan’s experience in transylvania i could not have
 believed. as it was, i didn’t know what to believe, and so got out of my
 difficulty by attending to something else. i took the cover off my
 typewriter, and said to dr. seward:--
 
“let write this all out now. we must be ready for dr. helsing
 when comes. i have sent telegram to jonathan to come on here when
 arrives in london from whitby. in this matter dates are everything,
 and i think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item
 put in chronological order, we shall have done much. you tell that
 lord godalming and mr. morris are coming too. let us be able to tell him
 when they come.” accordingly set the phonograph at slow pace, and i
 began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. i used
 manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as i had done with
 all the rest. it was late when i got through, but dr. seward went about
 his work of going his round of the patients; when had finished he
 came back and sat near me, reading, so that i did not feel too lonely
 whilst i worked. how good and thoughtful is; the world seems full of
 good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. before i left him i
 remembered what jonathan put in his diary of the professor’s
 perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at
 exeter; so, seeing that dr. seward keeps his newspapers, i borrowed the
 files of “the westminster gazette” and “the pall mall gazette,” and took
 them to my room. i remember how much “the dailygraph” and “the whitby
 gazette,” of which i had made cuttings, helped us to understand the
 terrible events at whitby when count dracula landed, so i shall look
 through the evening papers since then, and perhaps i shall get some new
 light. i am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep quiet.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_30 september._--mr. harker arrived at nine o’clock. had got his
 wife’s wire just before starting. is uncommonly clever, if one can
 judge from his face, and full of energy. if this journal be true--and
 judging by one’s own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also man
 of great nerve. that going down to the vault second time was a
 remarkable piece of daring. after reading his account of it i was
 prepared to meet good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,
 business-like gentleman who came here to-day.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--after lunch harker and his wife went back to their own room,
 and as i passed while ago i heard the click of the typewriter. they
 are hard at it. mrs. harker says that they are knitting together in
 chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. harker has got
 the letters between the consignee of the boxes at whitby and the
 carriers in london who took charge of them. is now reading his wife’s
 typescript of my diary. i wonder what they make out of it. here it
 is....
 
strange that it never struck that the very next house might be
 the count’s hiding-place! goodness knows that we had enough clues
 from the conduct of the patient renfield! the bundle of letters
 relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. oh,
 if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor lucy!
 stop; that way madness lies! harker has gone back, and is again
 collating his material. says that by dinner-time they will be
 able to show whole connected narrative. thinks that in the
 meantime i should see renfield, as hitherto has been sort of
 index to the coming and going of the count. i hardly see this yet,
 but when i get at the dates i suppose i shall. what good thing
 that mrs. harker put my cylinders into type! we never could have
 found the dates otherwise....
 
i found renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands
 folded, smiling benignly. at the moment seemed as sane as any
 one i ever saw. i sat down and talked with him on lot of
 subjects, all of which treated naturally. then, of his own
 accord, spoke of going home, subject has never mentioned to my
 knowledge during his sojourn here. in fact, spoke quite
 confidently of getting his discharge at once. i believe that, had i
 not had the chat with harker and read the letters and the dates of
 his outbursts, i should have been prepared to sign for him after a
 brief time of observation. as it is, i am darkly suspicious. all
 those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the
 count. what then does this absolute content mean? can it be that
 his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire’s ultimate triumph?
 stay; is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the
 chapel door of the deserted house always spoke of “master.” this
 all seems confirmation of our idea. however, after while i came
 away; my friend is just little too sane at present to make it
 safe to probe him too deep with questions. might begin to think,
 and then--! so i came away. i mistrust these quiet moods of his; so
 i have given the attendant hint to look closely after him, and to
 have strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_29 september, in train to london._--when i received mr. billington’s
 courteous message that would give any information in his power i
 thought it best to go down to whitby and make, on the spot, such
 inquiries as i wanted. it was now my object to trace that horrid cargo
 of the count’s to its place in london. later, we may be able to deal
 with it. billington junior, nice lad, met at the station, and
 brought to his father’s house, where they had decided that i must
 stay the night. they are hospitable, with true yorkshire hospitality:
 give guest everything, and leave him free to do as likes. they all
 knew that i was busy, and that my stay was short, and mr. billington had
 ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.
 it gave almost turn to see again one of the letters which i had
 seen on the count’s table before i knew of his diabolical plans.
 everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and
 with precision. seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which
 might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried
 out. to use an americanism, had “taken chances,” and the absolute
 accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the
 logical result of his care. i saw the invoice, and took note of it:
 “fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.”
 also the copy of letter to carter paterson, and their reply; of both of
 these i got copies. this was all the information mr. billington could
 give me, so i went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the customs
 officers and the harbour-master. they had all something to say of the
 strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local
 tradition; but one could add to the simple description “fifty cases
 of common earth.” i then saw the station-master, who kindly put in
 communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. their
 tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that
 the boxes were “main and mortal heavy,” and that shifting them was dry
 work. one of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn’t any
 gentleman “such-like as yourself, squire,” to show some sort of
 appreciation of their efforts in liquid form; another put in rider
 that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had
 elapsed had not completely allayed it. needless to add, i took care
 before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of
 reproach.
 
* * * * *
 
_30 september._--the station-master was good enough to give line to
 his old companion the station-master at king’s cross, so that when i
 arrived there in the morning i was able to ask him about the arrival of
 the boxes. he, too, put at once in communication with the proper
 officials, and i saw that their tally was correct with the original
 invoice. the opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here
 limited; noble use of them had, however, been made, and again i was
 compelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.
 
from thence i went on to carter paterson’s central office, where i met
 with the utmost courtesy. they looked up the transaction in their
 day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their king’s cross
 office for more details. by good fortune, the men who did the teaming
 were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending
 also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the
 delivery of the boxes at carfax. here again i found the tally agreeing
 exactly; the carriers’ men were able to supplement the paucity of the
 written words with few details. these were, i shortly found, connected
 almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent
 thirst engendered in the operators. on my affording an opportunity,
 through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a
 later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--
 
“that ’ere ’ouse, guv’nor, is the rummiest i ever was in. blyme! but it
 ain’t been touched sence hundred years. there was dust that thick in
 the place that you might have slep’ on it without ’urtin’ of yer bones;
 an’ the place was that neglected that yer might ’ave smelled ole
 jerusalem in it. but the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! me
 and my mate, we thort we wouldn’t never git out quick enough. lor’, i
 wouldn’t take less nor quid moment to stay there arter dark.”
 
having been in the house, i could well believe him; but if knew what
 i know, would, i think, have raised his terms.
 
of one thing i am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at
 whitby from varna in the _demeter_ were safely deposited in the old
 chapel at carfax. there should be fifty of them there, unless any have
 since been removed--as from dr. seward’s diary i fear.
 
i shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from carfax when
 renfield attacked them. by following up this clue we may learn good
 deal.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--mina and i have worked all day, and we have put all the papers
 into order.
 

_mina harker’s journal_
 
_30 september._--i am so glad that i hardly know how to contain myself.
 it is, i suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which i have had:
 that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act
 detrimentally on jonathan. i saw him leave for whitby with as brave a
 face as i could, but i was sick with apprehension. the effort has,
 however, done him good. was never so resolute, never so strong, never
 so full of volcanic energy, as at present. it is just as that dear, good
 professor helsing said: is true grit, and improves under
 strain that would kill weaker nature. came back full of life and
 hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. i
 feel myself quite wild with excitement. i suppose one ought to pity any
 thing so hunted as is the count. that is just it: this thing is not
 human--not even beast. to read dr. seward’s account of poor lucy’s
 death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in
 one’s heart.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--lord godalming and mr. morris arrived earlier than we
 expected. dr. seward was out on business, and had taken jonathan with
 him, so i had to see them. it was to painful meeting, for it
 brought back all poor dear lucy’s hopes of only few months ago. of
 course they had heard lucy speak of me, and it seemed that dr. van
 helsing, too, has been quite “blowing my trumpet,” as mr. morris
 expressed it. poor fellows, neither of them is aware that i know all
 about the proposals they made to lucy. they did not quite know what to
 say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they
 had to keep on neutral subjects. however, i thought the matter over, and
 came to the conclusion that the best thing i could do would be to post
 them in affairs right up to date. i knew from dr. seward’s diary that
 they had been at lucy’s death--her real death--and that i need not fear
 to betray any secret before the time. so i told them, as well as i
 could, that i had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband
 and i, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.
 i gave them each copy to read in the library. when lord godalming got
 his and turned it over--it does make pretty good pile--he said:--
 
“did you write all this, mrs. harker?”
 
i nodded, and went on:--
 
“i don’t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and
 kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all
 i can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. i have
 had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make man humble
 to the last hour of his life. besides, i know you loved my poor lucy--”
 here turned away and covered his face with his hands. i could hear
 the tears in his voice. mr. morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid
 hand for moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the
 room. i suppose there is something in woman’s nature that makes man
 free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or
 emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when
 lord godalming found himself alone with sat down on the sofa and
 gave way utterly and openly. i sat down beside him and took his hand. i
 hope didn’t think it forward of me, and that if ever thinks of it
 afterwards never will have such thought. there i wrong him; i
 _know_ never will--he is too true gentleman. i said to him, for i
 could see that his heart was breaking:--
 
“i loved dear lucy, and i know what she was to you, and what you were to
 her. she and i were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let
 be like sister to you in your trouble? i know what sorrows you have
 had, though i cannot measure the depth of them. if sympathy and pity can
 help in your affliction, won’t you let be of some little service--for
 lucy’s sake?”
 
in an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. it seemed
 to that all that had of late been suffering in silence found a
 vent at once. grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat
 his palms together in perfect agony of grief. stood up and then sat
 down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. i felt an infinite
 pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. with sob laid his
 head on my shoulder and cried like wearied child, whilst shook with
 emotion.
 
we women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above
 smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; i felt this big
 sorrowing man’s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby
 that some day may lie on my bosom, and i stroked his hair as though he
 were my own child. i never thought at the time how strange it all was.
 
after little bit his sobs ceased, and raised himself with an
 apology, though made disguise of his emotion. told that for
 days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been
 unable to speak with any one, as man must speak in his time of
 sorrow. there was woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with
 whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was
 surrounded, could speak freely. “i know now how i suffered,” said,
 as dried his eyes, “but i do not know even yet--and none other can
 ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to to-day. i shall
 know better in time; and believe that, though i am not ungrateful
 now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. you will let be
 like brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear lucy’s sake?”
 
“for dear lucy’s sake,” i said as we clasped hands. “ay, and for your
 own sake,” added, “for if man’s esteem and gratitude are ever worth
 the winning, you have won mine to-day. if ever the future should bring
 to you time when you need man’s help, believe me, you will not call
 in vain. god grant that such time may ever come to you to break the
 sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise that you
 will let know.” was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that
 i felt it would comfort him, so i said:--
 
“i promise.”
 
as i came along the corridor i saw mr. morris looking out of window.
 turned as heard my footsteps. “how is art?” said. then noticing
 my red eyes, went on: “ah, i see you have been comforting him. poor
 old fellow! needs it. one but woman can help man when is in
 trouble of the heart; and had one to comfort him.”
 
bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. i saw the
 manuscript in his hand, and i knew that when read it would realise
 how much i knew; so i said to him:--
 
“i wish i could comfort all who suffer from the heart. will you let me
 be your friend, and will you come to for comfort if you need it? you
 will know, later on, why i speak.” saw that i was in earnest, and
 stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. it seemed
 but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish soul, and impulsively i
 bent over and kissed him. the tears rose in his eyes, and there was a
 momentary choking in his throat; said quite calmly:--
 
“little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long
 as ever you live!” then went into the study to his friend.
 
“little girl!”--the very words had used to lucy, and oh, but he
 proved himself friend!
 



chapter xviii
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_30 september._--i got home at five o’clock, and found that godalming
 and morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript
 of the various diaries and letters which harker and his wonderful wife
 had made and arranged. harker had not yet returned from his visit to the
 carriers’ men, of whom dr. hennessey had written to me. mrs. harker gave
 us cup of tea, and i can honestly say that, for the first time since i
 have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. when we had
 finished, mrs. harker said:--
 
“dr. seward, may i ask favour? i want to see your patient, mr.
 renfield. do let see him. what you have said of him in your diary
 interests so much!” she looked so appealing and so pretty that i
 could not refuse her, and there was possible reason why i should; so
 i took her with me. when i went into the room, i told the man that a
 lady would like to see him; to which simply answered: “why?”
 
“she is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,” i
 answered. “oh, very well,” said; “let her come in, by all means; but
 just wait minute till i tidy up the place.” his method of tidying was
 peculiar: simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes
 before i could stop him. it was quite evident that feared, or was
 jealous of, some interference. when had got through his disgusting
 task, said cheerfully: “let the lady come in,” and sat down on the
 edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that
 could see her as she entered. for moment i thought that might
 have some homicidal intent; i remembered how quiet had been just
 before attacked in my own study, and i took care to stand where i
 could seize him at once if attempted to make spring at her. she
 came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command
 the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad
 people most respect. she walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and
 held out her hand.
 
“good-evening, mr. renfield,” said she. “you see, i know you, for dr.
 seward has told of you.” made immediate reply, but eyed her all
 over intently with set frown on his face. this look gave way to one
 of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he
 said:--
 
“you’re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? you can’t be,
 you know, for she’s dead.” mrs. harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--
 
“oh no! i have husband of my own, to whom i was married before i ever
 saw dr. seward, or me. i am mrs. harker.”
 
“then what are you doing here?”
 
“my husband and i are staying on visit with dr. seward.”
 
“then don’t stay.”
 
“but why not?” i thought that this style of conversation might not be
 pleasant to mrs. harker, any more than it was to me, so i joined in:--
 
“how did you know i wanted to marry any one?” his reply was simply
 contemptuous, given in pause in which turned his eyes from mrs.
 harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--
 
“what an asinine question!”
 
“i don’t see that at all, mr. renfield,” said mrs. harker, at once
 championing me. replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as
 had shown contempt to me:--
 
“you will, of course, understand, mrs. harker, that when man is so
 loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of
 interest in our little community. dr. seward is loved not only by his
 household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of
 them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and
 effects. since i myself have been an inmate of lunatic asylum, i
 cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates
 lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.” i
 positively opened my eyes at this new development. here was my own pet
 lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that i had ever met
 with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of polished
 gentleman. i wonder if it was mrs. harker’s presence which had touched
 some chord in his memory. if this new phase was spontaneous, or in any
 way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or
 power.
 
we continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that was seemingly
 quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at questioningly as she
 began, to lead him to his favourite topic. i was again astonished, for
 addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the
 completest sanity; even took himself as an example when mentioned
 certain things.
 
“why, i myself am an instance of man who had strange belief. indeed,
 it was wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being
 put under control. i used to fancy that life was positive and
 perpetual entity, and that by consuming multitude of live things, no
 matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong
 life. at times i held the belief so strongly that i actually tried to
 take human life. the doctor here will bear out that on one occasion i
 tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by
 the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his
 blood--relying, of course, upon the scriptural phrase, ‘for the blood is
 the life.’ though, indeed, the vendor of certain nostrum has
 vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. isn’t that true,
 doctor?” i nodded assent, for i was so amazed that i hardly knew what to
 either think or say; it was hard to imagine that i had seen him eat up
 his spiders and flies not five minutes before. looking at my watch, i
 saw that i should go to the station to meet helsing, so i told mrs.
 harker that it was time to leave. she came at once, after saying
 pleasantly to mr. renfield: “good-bye, and i hope i may see you often,
 under auspices pleasanter to yourself,” to which, to my astonishment, he
 replied:--
 
“good-bye, my dear. i pray god i may never see your sweet face again.
 may bless and keep you!”
 
when i went to the station to meet helsing i left the boys behind
 me. poor art seemed more cheerful than has been since lucy first took
 ill, and quincey is more like his own bright self than has been for
 many long day.
 
helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
 boy. saw at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--
 
“ah, friend john, how goes all? well? so! i have been busy, for i come
 here to stay if need be. all affairs are settled with me, and i have
 much to tell. madam mina is with you? yes. and her so fine husband? and
 arthur and my friend quincey, they are with you, too? good!”
 
as i drove to the house i told him of what had passed, and of how my own
 diary had come to be of some use through mrs. harker’s suggestion; at
 which the professor interrupted me:--
 
“ah, that wonderful madam mina! she has man’s brain--a brain that man
 should have were much gifted--and woman’s heart. the good god
 fashioned her for purpose, believe me, when made that so good
 combination. friend john, up to now fortune has made that woman of help
 to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible
 affair. it is not good that she run risk so great. we men are
 determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is
 part for woman. even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her
 in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in
 waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. and, besides,
 she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to
 think of some time, if not now. you tell she has wrote all, then she
 must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and
 we go alone.” i agreed heartily with him, and then i told him what we
 had found in his absence: that the house which dracula had bought was
 the very next one to my own. was amazed, and great concern seemed
 to come on him. “oh that we had known it before!” said, “for then we
 might have reached him in time to save poor lucy. however, ‘the milk
 that is spilt cries not out afterwards,’ as you say. we shall not think
 of that, but go on our way to the end.” then fell into silence that
 lasted till we entered my own gateway. before we went to prepare for
 dinner said to mrs. harker:--
 
“i am told, madam mina, by my friend john that you and your husband have
 put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.”
 
“not up to this moment, professor,” she said impulsively, “but up to
 this morning.”
 
“but why not up to now? we have seen hitherto how good light all the
 little things have made. we have told our secrets, and yet one who
 has told is the worse for it.”
 
mrs. harker began to blush, and taking paper from her pockets, she
 said:--
 
“dr. helsing, will you read this, and tell if it must go in. it
 is my record of to-day. i too have seen the need of putting down at
 present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except
 what is personal. must it go in?” the professor read it over gravely,
 and handed it back, saying:--
 
“it need not go in if you do not wish it; but i pray that it may. it can
 but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more
 honour you--as well as more esteem and love.” she took it back with
 another blush and bright smile.
 
and so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete
 and in order. the professor took away one copy to study after dinner,
 and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o’clock. the rest of us
 have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all
 be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this
 terrible and mysterious enemy.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_30 september._--when we met in dr. seward’s study two hours after
 dinner, which had been at six o’clock, we unconsciously formed sort of
 board or committee. professor helsing took the head of the table, to
 which dr. seward motioned him as came into the room. made sit
 next to him on his right, and asked to act as secretary; jonathan sat
 next to me. opposite us were lord godalming, dr. seward, and mr.
 morris--lord godalming being next the professor, and dr. seward in the
 centre. the professor said:--
 
“i may, i suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts
 that are in these papers.” we all expressed assent, and went on:--
 
“then it were, i think good that i tell you something of the kind of
 enemy with which we have to deal. i shall then make known to you
 something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.
 so we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure
 according.
 
“there are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they
 exist. even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the
 teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane
 peoples. i admit that at the first i was sceptic. were it not that
 through long years i have train myself to keep an open mind, i could not
 have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. ‘see! see!
 i prove; i prove.’ alas! had i known at the first what now i know--nay,
 had i even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of
 us who did love her. but that is gone; and we must so work, that other
 poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. the _nosferatu_ do not die
 like the bee when sting once. is only stronger; and being
 stronger, have yet more power to work evil. this vampire which is
 amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; is of
 cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; have
 still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the
 divination by the dead, and all the dead that can come nigh to are
 for him at command; is brute, and more than brute; is devil in
 callous, and the heart of him is not; can, within limitations, appear
 at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he
 can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the
 thunder; can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and
 the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; can grow and become
 small; and can at times vanish and come unknown. how then are we to
 begin our strike to destroy him? how shall we find his where; and having
 found it, how can we destroy? my friends, this is much; it is terrible
 task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave
 shudder. for if we fail in this our fight must surely win; and then
 where end we? life is nothings; i heed him not. but to fail here, is not
 mere life or death. it is that we become as him; that we henceforward
 become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,
 preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. to us for
 ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?
 we go on for all time abhorred by all; blot on the face of god’s
 sunshine; an arrow in the side of him who died for man. but we are face
 to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? for me, i say, no;
 but then i am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his
 song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. you others are
 young. some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. what
 say you?”
 
whilst was speaking, jonathan had taken my hand. i feared, oh so
 much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when i
 saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to to feel its touch--so
 strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. brave man’s hand can speak for
 itself; it does not even need woman’s love to hear its music.
 
when the professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and i
 in his; there was need for speaking between us.
 
“i answer for mina and myself,” said.
 
“count in, professor,” said mr. quincey morris, laconically as usual.
 
“i am with you,” said lord godalming, “for lucy’s sake, if for other
 reason.”
 
dr. seward simply nodded. the professor stood up and, after laying his
 golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. i took
 his right hand, and lord godalming his left; jonathan held my right with
 his left and stretched across to mr. morris. so as we all took hands our
 solemn compact was made. i felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even
 occur to to draw back. we resumed our places, and dr. helsing
 went on with sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work
 had begun. it was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike way,
 as any other transaction of life:--
 
“well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not
 without strength. we have on our side power of combination--a power
 denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to
 act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.
 in fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are
 free to use them. we have self-devotion in cause, and an end to
 achieve which is not selfish one. these things are much.
 
“now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are
 restrict, and how the individual cannot. in fine, let us consider the
 limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.
 
“all we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. these do not
 at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay
 of more than either life or death. yet must we be satisfied; in the
 first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and
 secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and
 superstition--are everything. does not the belief in vampires rest for
 others--though not, alas! for us--on them? year ago which of us would
 have received such possibility, in the midst of our scientific,
 sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? we even scouted belief
 that we saw justified under our very eyes. take it, then, that the
 vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the
 moment on the same base. for, let tell you, is known everywhere
 that men have been. in old greece, in old rome; flourish in germany
 all over, in france, in india, even in the chernosese; and in china, so
 far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at
 this day. have follow the wake of the berserker icelander, the
 devil-begotten hun, the slav, the saxon, the magyar. so far, then, we
 have all we may act upon; and let tell you that very much of the
 beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy
 experience. the vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the
 time; can flourish when that can fatten on the blood of the
 living. even more, we have seen amongst us that can even grow
 younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though
 they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. but he
 cannot flourish without this diet; eat not as others. even friend
 jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!
 throws shadow; make in the mirror reflect, as again
 jonathan observe. has the strength of many of his hand--witness again
 jonathan when shut the door against the wolfs, and when help him
 from the diligence too. can transform himself to wolf, as we gather
 from the ship arrival in whitby, when tear open the dog; can be as
 bat, as madam mina saw him on the window at whitby, and as friend john
 saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend quincey saw him at
 the window of miss lucy. can come in mist which create--that noble
 ship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance
 can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. he
 come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again jonathan saw those
 sisters in the castle of dracula. become so small--we ourselves saw
 miss lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through hairbreadth space at the
 tomb door. can, when once find his way, come out from anything or
 into anything, matter how close it be bound or even fused up with
 fire--solder you call it. can see in the dark--no small power this,
 in world which is one half shut from the light. ah, but hear me
 through. can do all these things, yet is not free. nay; is even
 more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.
 cannot go where lists; who is not of nature has yet to obey
 some of nature’s laws--why we know not. may not enter anywhere at the
 first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;
 though afterwards can come as please. his power ceases, as does
 that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. only at certain times
 can have limited freedom. if be not at the place whither is
 bound, can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.
 these things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by
 inference. thus, whereas can do as will within his limit, when he
 have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place
 unhallowed, as we saw when went to the grave of the suicide at
 whitby; still at other time can only change when the time come. it is
 said, too, that can only pass running water at the slack or the flood
 of the tide. then there are things which so afflict him that has no
 power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this
 symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to
 them is nothing, but in their presence take his place far off and
 silent with respect. there are others, too, which i shall tell you of,
 lest in our seeking we may need them. the branch of wild rose on his
 coffin keep him that move not from it; sacred bullet fired into the
 coffin kill him so that be true dead; and as for the stake through
 him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.
 we have seen it with our eyes.
 
“thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine
 him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. but is
 clever. i have asked my friend arminius, of buda-pesth university, to
 make his record; and, from all the means that are, tell of what he
 has been. must, indeed, have been that voivode dracula who won his
 name against the turk, over the great river on the very frontier of
 turkey-land. if it be so, then was common man; for in that time,
 and for centuries after, was spoken of as the cleverest and the most
 cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ‘land beyond the
 forest.’ that mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his
 grave, and are even now arrayed against us. the draculas were, says
 arminius, great and noble race, though now and again were scions who
 were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the evil one. they
 learned his secrets in the scholomance, amongst the mountains over lake
 hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. in the
 records are such words as ‘stregoica’--witch, ‘ordog,’ and
 ‘pokol’--satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very dracula is
 spoken of as ‘wampyr,’ which we all understand too well. there have been
 from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their
 graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. for it
 is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in
 all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.”
 
whilst they were talking mr. morris was looking steadily at the window,
 and now got up quietly, and went out of the room. there was little
 pause, and then the professor went on:--
 
“and now we must settle what we do. we have here much data, and we must
 proceed to lay out our campaign. we know from the inquiry of jonathan
 that from the castle to whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which
 were delivered at carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes
 have been removed. it seems to me, that our first step should be to
 ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall
 where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. if the
 latter, we must trace----”
 
here we were interrupted in very startling way. outside the house came
 the sound of pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a
 bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the
 far wall of the room. i am afraid i am at heart coward, for i shrieked
 out. the men all jumped to their feet; lord godalming flew over to the
 window and threw up the sash. as did so we heard mr. morris’s voice
 without:--
 
“sorry! i fear i have alarmed you. i shall come in and tell you about
 it.” minute later came in and said:--
 
“it was an idiotic thing of to do, and i ask your pardon, mrs.
 harker, most sincerely; i fear i must have frightened you terribly. but
 the fact is that whilst the professor was talking there came big bat
 and sat on the window-sill. i have got such horror of the damned
 brutes from recent events that i cannot stand them, and i went out to
 have shot, as i have been doing of late of evenings, whenever i have
 seen one. you used to laugh at for it then, art.”
 
“did you hit it?” asked dr. helsing.
 
“i don’t know; i fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.” without
 saying any more took his seat, and the professor began to resume his
 statement:--
 
“we must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must
 either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to
 speak, sterilise the earth, so that more can seek safety in it.
 thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of
 noon and sunset, and so engage with him when is at his most weak.
 
“and now for you, madam mina, this night is the end until all be well.
 you are too precious to us to have such risk. when we part to-night, you
 more must question. we shall tell you all in good time. we are men
 and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we
 shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we
 are.”
 
all the men, even jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me
 good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their
 safety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their
 minds were made up, and, though it was bitter pill for to swallow,
 i could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.
 
mr. morris resumed the discussion:--
 
“as there is time to lose, i vote we have look at his house right
 now. time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save
 another victim.”
 
i own that my heart began to fail when the time for action came so
 close, but i did not say anything, for i had greater fear that if i
 appeared as drag or hindrance to their work, they might even leave
 out of their counsels altogether. they have now gone off to carfax,
 with means to get into the house.
 
manlike, they had told to go to bed and sleep; as if woman can
 sleep when those she loves are in danger! i shall lie down and pretend
 to sleep, lest jonathan have added anxiety about when returns.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_1 october, 4 a. m._--just as we were about to leave the house, an
 urgent message was brought to from renfield to know if i would see
 him at once, as had something of the utmost importance to say to me.
 i told the messenger to say that i would attend to his wishes in the
 morning; i was busy just at the moment. the attendant added:--
 
“he seems very importunate, sir. i have never seen him so eager. i don’t
 know but what, if you don’t see him soon, will have one of his
 violent fits.” i knew the man would not have said this without some
 cause, so i said: “all right; i’ll go now”; and i asked the others to
 wait few minutes for me, as i had to go and see my “patient.”
 
“take with you, friend john,” said the professor. “his case in your
 diary interest much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_
 case. i should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is
 disturbed.”
 
“may i come also?” asked lord godalming.
 
“me too?” said quincey morris. “may i come?” said harker. i nodded, and
 we all went down the passage together.
 
we found him in state of considerable excitement, but far more
 rational in his speech and manner than i had ever seen him. there was an
 unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything i had ever
 met with in lunatic; and took it for granted that his reasons would
 prevail with others entirely sane. we all four went into the room, but
 none of the others at first said anything. his request was that i would
 at once release him from the asylum and send him home. this backed up
 with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own
 existing sanity. “i appeal to your friends,” said, “they will,
 perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. by the way, you have
 not introduced me.” i was so much astonished, that the oddness of
 introducing madman in an asylum did not strike at the moment; and,
 besides, there was certain dignity in the man’s manner, so much of
 the habit of equality, that i at once made the introduction: “lord
 godalming; professor helsing; mr. quincey morris, of texas; mr.
 renfield.” shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--
 
“lord godalming, i had the honour of seconding your father at the
 windham; i grieve to know, by your holding the title, that is no
 more. was man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his
 youth was, i have heard, the inventor of burnt rum punch, much
 patronised on derby night. mr. morris, you should be proud of your great
 state. its reception into the union was precedent which may have
 far-reaching effects hereafter, when the pole and the tropics may hold
 alliance to the stars and stripes. the power of treaty may yet prove a
 vast engine of enlargement, when the monroe doctrine takes its true
 place as political fable. what shall any man say of his pleasure at
 meeting helsing? sir, i make apology for dropping all forms of
 conventional prefix. when an individual has revolutionised therapeutics
 by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,
 conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to
 one of class. you, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by
 the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective
 places in the moving world, i take to witness that i am as sane as at
 least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.
 and i am sure that you, dr. seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as
 well as scientist, will deem it moral duty to deal with as one to
 be considered as under exceptional circumstances.” made this last
 appeal with courtly air of conviction which was not without its own
 charm.
 
i think we were all staggered. for my own part, i was under the
 conviction, despite my knowledge of the man’s character and history,
 that his reason had been restored; and i felt under strong impulse to
 tell him that i was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the
 necessary formalities for his release in the morning. i thought it
 better to wait, however, before making so grave statement, for of old
 i knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.
 so i contented myself with making general statement that appeared
 to be improving very rapidly; that i would have longer chat with him
 in the morning, and would then see what i could do in the direction of
 meeting his wishes. this did not at all satisfy him, for said
 quickly:--
 
“but i fear, dr. seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. i desire to
 go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if i may. time
 presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of
 the essence of the contract. i am sure it is only necessary to put
 before so admirable practitioner as dr. seward so simple, yet so
 momentous wish, to ensure its fulfilment.” looked at keenly, and
 seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised
 them closely. not meeting any sufficient response, went on:--
 
“is it possible that i have erred in my supposition?”
 
“you have,” i said frankly, but at the same time, as i felt, brutally.
 there was considerable pause, and then said slowly:--
 
“then i suppose i must only shift my ground of request. let ask for
 this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. i am content to implore
 in such case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. i
 am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, i
 assure you, take it from that they are good ones, sound and
 unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. could you look,
 sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which
 animate me. nay, more, you would count amongst the best and truest of
 your friends.” again looked at us all keenly. i had growing
 conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was
 but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let
 him go on little longer, knowing from experience that would, like
 all lunatics, give himself away in the end. helsing was gazing at
 him with look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting
 with the fixed concentration of his look. said to renfield in tone
 which did not surprise at the time, but only when i thought of it
 afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--
 
“can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free
 to-night? i will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,
 without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--dr.
 seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the
 privilege you seek.” shook his head sadly, and with look of
 poignant regret on his face. the professor went on:--
 
“come, sir, bethink yourself. you claim the privilege of reason in the
 highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete
 reasonableness. you do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since
 you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. if
 you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can
 we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? be wise, and help
 us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.” still shook
 his head as said:--
 
“dr. helsing, i have nothing to say. your argument is complete, and
 if i were free to speak i should not hesitate moment; but i am not my
 own master in the matter. i can only ask you to trust me. if i am
 refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.” i thought it was now
 time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so i went
 towards the door, simply saying:--
 
“come, my friends, we have work to do. good-night.”
 
as, however, i got near the door, new change came over the patient. he
 moved towards so quickly that for the moment i feared that was
 about to make another homicidal attack. my fears, however, were
 groundless, for held up his two hands imploringly, and made his
 petition in moving manner. as saw that the very excess of his
 emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old
 relations, became still more demonstrative. i glanced at helsing,
 and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so i became little more
 fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his
 efforts were unavailing. i had previously seen something of the same
 constantly growing excitement in him when had to make some request of
 which at the time had thought much, such, for instance, as when he
 wanted cat; and i was prepared to see the collapse into the same
 sullen acquiescence on this occasion. my expectation was not realised,
 for, when found that his appeal would not be successful, got into
 quite frantic condition. threw himself on his knees, and held up
 his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a
 torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his
 whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--
 
“let entreat you, dr. seward, oh, let implore you, to let out
 of this house at once. send away how you will and where you will;
 send keepers with with whips and chains; let them take in a
 strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to gaol; but let go
 out of this. you don’t know what you do by keeping here. i am
 speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. you don’t know
 whom you wrong, or how; and i may not tell. woe is me! i may not tell.
 by all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is
 lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the almighty, take out
 of this and save my soul from guilt! can’t you hear me, man? can’t you
 understand? will you never learn? don’t you know that i am sane and
 earnest now; that i am lunatic in mad fit, but sane man fighting
 for his soul? oh, hear me! hear me! let go! let go! let go!”
 
i thought that the longer this went on the wilder would get, and so
 would bring on fit; so i took him by the hand and raised him up.
 
“come,” i said sternly, “no more of this; we have had quite enough
 already. get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.”
 
suddenly stopped and looked at intently for several moments. then,
 without word, rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the
 bed. the collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as i had
 expected.
 
when i was leaving the room, last of our party, said to in a
 quiet, well-bred voice:--
 
“you will, i trust, dr. seward, do the justice to bear in mind, later
 on, that i did what i could to convince you to-night.”
 



chapter xix
 
jonathan harker’s journal
 

_1 october, 5 a. m._--i went with the party to the search with an easy
 mind, for i think i never saw mina so absolutely strong and well. i am
 so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.
 somehow, it was dread to that she was in this fearful business at
 all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and
 brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such way
 that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and
 that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. we were, i think, all a
 little upset by the scene with mr. renfield. when we came away from his
 room we were silent till we got back to the study. then mr. morris said
 to dr. seward:--
 
“say, jack, if that man wasn’t attempting bluff, is about the
 sanest lunatic i ever saw. i’m not sure, but i believe that had some
 serious purpose, and if had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a
 chance.” lord godalming and i were silent, but dr. helsing added:--
 
“friend john, you know more of lunatics than i do, and i’m glad of it,
 for i fear that if it had been to to decide i would before that last
 hysterical outburst have given him free. but we live and learn, and in
 our present task we must take chance, as my friend quincey would say.
 all is best as they are.” dr. seward seemed to answer them both in a
 dreamy kind of way:--
 
“i don’t know but that i agree with you. if that man had been an
 ordinary lunatic i would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he
 seems so mixed up with the count in an indexy kind of way that i am
 afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. i can’t forget how
 prayed with almost equal fervour for cat, and then tried to tear my
 throat out with his teeth. besides, called the count ‘lord and
 master,’ and may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.
 that horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help
 him, so i suppose isn’t above trying to use respectable lunatic. he
 certainly did seem earnest, though. i only hope we have done what is
 best. these things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,
 help to unnerve man.” the professor stepped over, and laying his hand
 on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--
 
“friend john, have fear. we are trying to do our duty in very sad
 and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. what else have we to
 hope for, except the pity of the good god?” lord godalming had slipped
 away for few minutes, but now returned. held up little silver
 whistle, as remarked:--
 
“that old place may be full of rats, and if so, i’ve got an antidote on
 call.” having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care
 to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone
 out. when we got to the porch the professor opened his bag and took out
 lot of things, which laid on the step, sorting them into four
 little groups, evidently one for each. then spoke:--
 
“my friends, we are going into terrible danger, and we need arms of
 many kinds. our enemy is not merely spiritual. remember that has the
 strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are
 of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not
 amenable to mere strength. stronger man, or body of men more strong
 in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him
 as we can be hurt by him. we must, therefore, guard ourselves from his
 touch. keep this near your heart”--as spoke lifted little silver
 crucifix and held it out to me, i being nearest to him--“put these
 flowers round your neck”--here handed to wreath of withered
 garlic blossoms--“for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this
 knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can
 fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,
 which we must not desecrate needless.” this was portion of sacred
 wafer, which put in an envelope and handed to me. each of the others
 was similarly equipped. “now,” said, “friend john, where are the
 skeleton keys? if so that we can open the door, we need not break house
 by the window, as before at miss lucy’s.”
 
dr. seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a
 surgeon standing him in good stead. presently got one to suit; after
 little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with rusty
 clang, shot back. we pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and
 it slowly opened. it was startlingly like the image conveyed to in
 dr. seward’s diary of the opening of miss westenra’s tomb; i fancy that
 the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they
 shrank back. the professor was the first to move forward, and stepped
 into the open door.
 
“_in manus tuas, domine!_” said, crossing himself as passed over
 the threshold. we closed the door behind us, lest when we should have
 lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. the
 professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it
 from within should we be in hurry making our exit. then we all lit our
 lamps and proceeded on our search.
 
the light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the
 rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great
 shadows. i could not for my life get away from the feeling that there
 was some one else amongst us. i suppose it was the recollection, so
 powerfully brought home to by the grim surroundings, of that terrible
 experience in transylvania. i think the feeling was common to us all,
 for i noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every
 sound and every new shadow, just as i felt myself doing.
 
the whole place was thick with dust. the floor was seemingly inches
 deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down
 my lamp i could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. the
 walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of
 spider’s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old
 tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. on table in the
 hall was great bunch of keys, with time-yellowed label on each. they
 had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents
 in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the professor
 lifted them. turned to and said:--
 
“you know this place, jonathan. you have copied maps of it, and you know
 it at least more than we do. which is the way to the chapel?” i had an
 idea of its direction, though on my former visit i had not been able to
 get admission to it; so i led the way, and after few wrong turnings
 found myself opposite low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.
 “this is the spot,” said the professor as turned his lamp on small
 map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence
 regarding the purchase. with little trouble we found the key on the
 bunch and opened the door. we were prepared for some unpleasantness, for
 as we were opening the door faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale
 through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we
 encountered. none of the others had met the count at all at close
 quarters, and when i had seen him was either in the fasting stage of
 his existence in his rooms or, when was gloated with fresh blood, in
 ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and
 close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. there was
 an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler
 air. but as to the odour itself, how shall i describe it? it was not
 alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the
 pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had
 become itself corrupt. faugh! it sickens to think of it. every breath
 exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and
 intensified its loathsomeness.
 
under ordinary circumstances such stench would have brought our
 enterprise to an end; but this was ordinary case, and the high and
 terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us strength which rose
 above merely physical considerations. after the involuntary shrinking
 consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our
 work as though that loathsome place were garden of roses.
 
we made an accurate examination of the place, the professor saying as we
 began:--
 
“the first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then
 examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some
 clue as to what has become of the rest.” glance was sufficient to show
 how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was
 mistaking them.
 
there were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! once i got fright,
 for, seeing lord godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted
 door into the dark passage beyond, i looked too, and for an instant my
 heart stood still. somewhere, looking out from the shadow, i seemed to
 see the high lights of the count’s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the
 red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. it was only for moment, for,
 as lord godalming said, “i thought i saw face, but it was only the
 shadows,” and resumed his inquiry, i turned my lamp in the direction,
 and stepped into the passage. there was sign of any one; and as there
 were corners, doors, aperture of any kind, but only the solid
 walls of the passage, there could be hiding-place even for _him_. i
 took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.
 
few minutes later i saw morris step suddenly back from corner, which
 was examining. we all followed his movements with our eyes, for
 undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw whole mass
 of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. we all instinctively drew
 back. the whole place was becoming alive with rats.
 
for moment or two we stood appalled, all save lord godalming, who was
 seemingly prepared for such an emergency. rushing over to the great
 iron-bound oaken door, which dr. seward had described from the outside,
 and which i had seen myself, turned the key in the lock, drew the
 huge bolts, and swung the door open. then, taking his little silver
 whistle from his pocket, blew low, shrill call. it was answered
 from behind dr. seward’s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a
 minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.
 unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved i
 noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been
 taken out had been brought this way. but even in the minute that had
 elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. they seemed to
 swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their
 moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look
 like bank of earth set with fireflies. the dogs dashed on, but at the
 threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting
 their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. the rats were
 multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.
 
lord godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him
 on the floor. the instant his feet touched the ground seemed to
 recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. they fled before
 him so fast that before had shaken the life out of score, the other
 dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey
 ere the whole mass had vanished.
 
with their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for
 the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at
 their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in
 the air with vicious shakes. we all seemed to find our spirits rise.
 whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
 the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves
 in the open i know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to
 slip from us like robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something
 of its grim significance, though we did not slacken whit in our
 resolution. we closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and
 bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. we found
 nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all
 untouched save for my own footsteps when i had made my first visit.
 never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when
 we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been
 rabbit-hunting in summer wood.
 
the morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.
 dr. helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and
 locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket
 when had done.
 
“so far,” said, “our night has been eminently successful. harm has
 come to us such as i feared might be and yet we have ascertained how
 many boxes are missing. more than all do i rejoice that this, our
 first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been
 accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet madam mina or
 troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and
 smells of horror which she might never forget. one lesson, too, we have
 learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute
 beasts which are to the count’s command are yet themselves not amenable
 to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his
 call, just as from his castle top summon the wolves to your going and
 to that poor mother’s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell
 from the so little dogs of my friend arthur. we have other matters
 before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used
 his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.
 so be it that has gone elsewhere. good! it has given us opportunity
 to cry ‘check’ in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the
 stake of human souls. and now let us go home. the dawn is close at hand,
 and we have reason to be content with our first night’s work. it may be
 ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;
 but we must go on, and from danger shall we shrink.”
 
the house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who
 was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and low, moaning sound
 from renfield’s room. the poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,
 after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.
 
i came tiptoe into our own room, and found mina asleep, breathing so
 softly that i had to put my ear down to hear it. she looks paler than
 usual. i hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. i am truly
 thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our
 deliberations. it is too great strain for woman to bear. i did not
 think so at first, but i know better now. therefore i am glad that it is
 settled. there may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet
 to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she
 suspected that there was any concealment. henceforth our work is to be a
 sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all
 is finished, and the earth free from monster of the nether world. i
 daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such
 confidence as ours; but i must be resolute, and to-morrow i shall keep
 dark over to-night’s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that
 has happened. i rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.
 
* * * * *
 
_1 october, later._--i suppose it was natural that we should have all
 overslept ourselves, for the day was busy one, and the night had no
 rest at all. even mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though i slept
 till the sun was high, i was awake before her, and had to call two or
 three times before she awoke. indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a
 few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at with sort of
 blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of bad dream. she
 complained little of being tired, and i let her rest till later in the
 day. we now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be
 that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace
 them all. such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the
 sooner the matter is attended to the better. i shall look up thomas
 snelling to-day.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_1 october._--it was towards noon when i was awakened by the professor
 walking into my room. was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it
 is quite evident that last night’s work has helped to take some of the
 brooding weight off his mind. after going over the adventure of the
 night suddenly said:--
 
“your patient interests much. may it be that with you i visit him
 this morning? or if that you are too occupy, i can go alone if it may
 be. it is new experience to to find lunatic who talk philosophy,
 and reason so sound.” i had some work to do which pressed, so i told him
 that if would go alone i would be glad, as then i should not have to
 keep him waiting; so i called an attendant and gave him the necessary
 instructions. before the professor left the room i cautioned him against
 getting any false impression from my patient. “but,” answered, “i
 want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live
 things. said to madam mina, as i see in your diary of yesterday, that
 had once had such belief. why do you smile, friend john?”
 
“excuse me,” i said, “but the answer is here.” i laid my hand on the
 type-written matter. “when our sane and learned lunatic made that very
 statement of how _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually
 nauseous with the flies and spiders which had eaten just before mrs.
 harker entered the room.” helsing smiled in turn. “good!” said.
 “your memory is true, friend john. i should have remembered. and yet it
 is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease
 such fascinating study. perhaps i may gain more knowledge out of the
 folly of this madman than i shall from the teaching of the most wise.
 who knows?” i went on with my work, and before long was through that in
 hand. it seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was
 helsing back in the study. “do i interrupt?” asked politely as he
 stood at the door.
 
“not at all,” i answered. “come in. my work is finished, and i am free.
 i can go with you now, if you like.
 
“it is needless; i have seen him!”
 
“well?”
 
“i fear that does not appraise at much. our interview was short.
 when i entered his room was sitting on stool in the centre, with
 his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen
 discontent. i spoke to him as cheerfully as i could, and with such a
 measure of respect as i could assume. made reply whatever. “don’t
 you know me?” i asked. his answer was not reassuring: “i know you well
 enough; you are the old fool helsing. i wish you would take yourself
 and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. damn all thick-headed
 dutchmen!” not word more would say, but sat in his implacable
 sullenness as indifferent to as though i had not been in the room at
 all. thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so
 clever lunatic; so i shall go, if i may, and cheer myself with few
 happy words with that sweet soul madam mina. friend john, it does
 rejoice unspeakable that she is more to be pained, more to be
 worried with our terrible things. though we shall much miss her help, it
 is better so.”
 
“i agree with you with all my heart,” i answered earnestly, for i did
 not want him to weaken in this matter. “mrs. harker is better out of it.
 things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have
 been in many tight places in our time; but it is place for woman,
 and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time
 infallibly have wrecked her.”
 
so helsing has gone to confer with mrs. harker and harker; quincey
 and art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. i
 shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_1 october._--it is strange to to be kept in the dark as i am to-day;
 after jonathan’s full confidence for so many years, to see him
 manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. this
 morning i slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though
 jonathan was late too, was the earlier. spoke to before went
 out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but never mentioned word of
 what had happened in the visit to the count’s house. and yet must
 have known how terribly anxious i was. poor dear fellow! i suppose it
 must have distressed him even more than it did me. they all agreed that
 it was best that i should not be drawn further into this awful work, and
 i acquiesced. but to think that keeps anything from me! and now i am
 crying like silly fool, when i _know_ it comes from my husband’s great
 love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.
 
that has done good. well, some day jonathan will tell all; and
 lest it should ever be that should think for moment that i kept
 anything from him, i still keep my journal as usual. then if has
 feared of my trust i shall show it to him, with every thought of my
 heart put down for his dear eyes to read. i feel strangely sad and
 low-spirited to-day. i suppose it is the reaction from the terrible
 excitement.
 
last night i went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told
 to. i didn’t feel sleepy, and i did feel full of devouring anxiety. i
 kept thinking over everything that has been ever since jonathan came to
 see in london, and it all seems like horrible tragedy, with fate
 pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. everything that one does
 seems, matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which
 is most to be deplored. if i hadn’t gone to whitby, perhaps poor dear
 lucy would be with us now. she hadn’t taken to visiting the churchyard
 till i came, and if she hadn’t come there in the day-time with she
 wouldn’t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn’t gone there at
 night and asleep, that monster couldn’t have destroyed her as did.
 oh, why did i ever go to whitby? there now, crying again! i wonder what
 has come over to-day. i must hide it from jonathan, for if knew
 that i had been crying twice in one morning--i, who never cried on my
 own account, and whom has never caused to shed tear--the dear
 fellow would fret his heart out. i shall put bold face on, and if i do
 feel weepy, shall never see it. i suppose it is one of the lessons
 that we poor women have to learn....
 
i can’t quite remember how i fell asleep last night. i remember hearing
 the sudden barking of the dogs and lot of queer sounds, like praying
 on very tumultuous scale, from mr. renfield’s room, which is somewhere
 under this. and then there was silence over everything, silence so
 profound that it startled me, and i got up and looked out of the window.
 all was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight
 seeming full of silent mystery of their own. not thing seemed to be
 stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that thin
 streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness
 across the grass towards the house, seemed to have sentience and a
 vitality of its own. i think that the digression of my thoughts must
 have done good, for when i got back to bed i found lethargy
 creeping over me. i lay while, but could not quite sleep, so i got out
 and looked out of the window again. the mist was spreading, and was now
 close up to the house, so that i could see it lying thick against the
 wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. the poor man was
 more loud than ever, and though i could not distinguish word said,
 i could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on
 his part. then there was the sound of struggle, and i knew that the
 attendants were dealing with him. i was so frightened that i crept into
 bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.
 i was not then bit sleepy, at least so i thought; but i must have
 fallen asleep, for, except dreams, i do not remember anything until the
 morning, when jonathan woke me. i think that it took an effort and a
 little time to realise where i was, and that it was jonathan who was
 bending over me. my dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of
 the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.
 
i thought that i was asleep, and waiting for jonathan to come back. i
 was very anxious about him, and i was powerless to act; my feet, and my
 hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the
 usual pace. and so i slept uneasily and thought. then it began to dawn
 upon that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. i put back the
 clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim
 around. the gaslight which i had left lit for jonathan, but turned down,
 came only like tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently
 grown thicker and poured into the room. then it occurred to that i
 had shut the window before i had come to bed. i would have got out to
 make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my
 limbs and even my will. i lay still and endured; that was all. i closed
 my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (it is wonderful what
 tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) the
 mist grew thicker and thicker and i could see now how it came in, for i
 could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling
 water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of
 the door. it got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became
 concentrated into sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top
 of which i could see the light of the gas shining like red eye. things
 began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now
 whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words “a
 pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.” was it indeed some such
 spiritual guidance that was coming to in my sleep? but the pillar was
 composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the
 red eye, which at the thought got new fascination for me; till, as i
 looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on through the fog like
 two red eyes, such as lucy told of in her momentary mental wandering
 when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of st. mary’s
 church. suddenly the horror burst upon that it was thus that jonathan
 had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist
 in the moonlight, and in my dream i must have fainted, for all became
 black darkness. the last conscious effort which imagination made was to
 show livid white face bending over out of the mist. i must be
 careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one’s reason if there were
 too much of them. i would get dr. helsing or dr. seward to prescribe
 something for which would make sleep, only that i fear to alarm
 them. such dream at the present time would become woven into their
 fears for me. to-night i shall strive hard to sleep naturally. if i do
 not, i shall to-morrow night get them to give dose of chloral; that
 cannot hurt for once, and it will give good night’s sleep. last
 night tired more than if i had not slept at all.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 october 10 p. m._--last night i slept, but did not dream. i must have
 slept soundly, for i was not waked by jonathan coming to bed; but the
 sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day i feel terribly weak and
 spiritless. i spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.
 in the afternoon mr. renfield asked if might see me. poor man, was
 very gentle, and when i came away kissed my hand and bade god bless
 me. some way it affected much; i am crying when i think of him. this
 is new weakness, of which i must be careful. jonathan would be
 miserable if knew i had been crying. and the others were out till
 dinner-time, and they all came in tired. i did what i could to brighten
 them up, and i suppose that the effort did good, for i forgot how
 tired i was. after dinner they sent to bed, and all went off to smoke
 together, as they said, but i knew that they wanted to tell each other
 of what had occurred to each during the day; i could see from jonathan’s
 manner that had something important to communicate. i was not so
 sleepy as i should have been; so before they went i asked dr. seward to
 give little opiate of some kind, as i had not slept well the night
 before. very kindly made up sleeping draught, which gave to
 me, telling that it would do harm, as it was very mild.... i
 have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. i hope
 i have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, new fear
 comes: that i may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the
 power of waking. i might want it. here comes sleep. good-night.
 



chapter xx
 
jonathan harker’s journal
 

_1 october, evening._--i found thomas snelling in his house at bethnal
 green, but unhappily was not in condition to remember anything. the
 very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had
 proved too much, and had begun too early on his expected debauch. i
 learned, however, from his wife, who seemed decent, poor soul, that he
 was only the assistant to smollet, who of the two mates was the
 responsible person. so off i drove to walworth, and found mr. joseph
 smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking late tea out of a
 saucer. is decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly good, reliable
 type of workman, and with headpiece of his own. remembered all
 about the incident of the boxes, and from wonderful dog’s-eared
 notebook, which produced from some mysterious receptacle about the
 seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,
 half-obliterated pencil, gave the destinations of the boxes. there
 were, said, six in the cartload which took from carfax and left at
 197, chicksand street, mile end new town, and another six which he
 deposited at jamaica lane, bermondsey. if then the count meant to
 scatter these ghastly refuges of his over london, these places were
 chosen as the first of delivery, so that later might distribute more
 fully. the systematic manner in which this was done made think that
 could not mean to confine himself to two sides of london. was now
 fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern
 shore, and on the south. the north and west were surely never meant to
 be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the city itself and the
 very heart of fashionable london in the south-west and west. i went back
 to smollet, and asked him if could tell us if any other boxes had
 been taken from carfax.
 
replied:--
 
“well, guv’nor, you’ve treated wery ’an’some”--i had given him half a
 sovereign--“an’ i’ll tell yer all i know. i heard man by the name of
 bloxam say four nights ago in the ’are an’ ’ounds, in pincher’s alley,
 as ’ow an’ his mate ’ad ’ad rare dusty job in old ’ouse at
 purfect. there ain’t a-many such jobs as this ’ere, an’ i’m thinkin’
 that maybe sam bloxam could tell ye summut.” i asked if could tell me
 where to find him. i told him that if could get the address it
 would be worth another half-sovereign to him. so gulped down the rest
 of his tea and stood up, saying that was going to begin the search
 then and there. at the door stopped, and said:--
 
“look ’ere, guv’nor, there ain’t sense in a-keepin’ you ’ere. i
 may find sam soon, or i mayn’t; but anyhow ain’t like to be in way
 to tell ye much to-night. sam is rare one when starts on the booze.
 if you can give envelope with stamp on it, and put yer address on
 it, i’ll find out where sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. but
 ye’d better be up arter ’im soon in the mornin’, or maybe ye won’t ketch
 ’im; for sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.”
 
this was all practical, so one of the children went off with penny to
 buy an envelope and sheet of paper, and to keep the change. when she
 came back, i addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when smollet had
 again faithfully promised to post the address when found, i took my way
 to home. we’re on the track anyhow. i am tired to-night, and want sleep.
 mina is fast asleep, and looks little too pale; her eyes look as
 though she had been crying. poor dear, i’ve doubt it frets her to be
 kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about and the
 others. but it is best as it is. it is better to be disappointed and
 worried in such way now than to have her nerve broken. the doctors
 were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful
 business. i must be firm, for on this particular burden of silence
 must rest. i shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any
 circumstances. indeed, it may not be hard task, after all, for she
 herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the
 count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 october, evening._--a long and trying and exciting day. by the first
 post i got my directed envelope with dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on
 which was written with carpenter’s pencil in sprawling hand:--
 
“sam bloxam, korkrans, 4, poters cort, bartel street, walworth. arsk for
 the depite.”
 
i got the letter in bed, and rose without waking mina. she looked heavy
 and sleepy and pale, and far from well. i determined not to wake her,
 but that, when i should return from this new search, i would arrange for
 her going back to exeter. i think she would be happier in our own home,
 with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and
 in ignorance. i only saw dr. seward for moment, and told him where i
 was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as i should
 have found out anything. i drove to walworth and found, with some
 difficulty, potter’s court. mr. smollet’s spelling misled me, as i asked
 for poter’s court instead of potter’s court. however, when i had found
 the court, i had difficulty in discovering corcoran’s lodging-house.
 when i asked the man who came to the door for the “depite,” shook his
 head, and said: “i dunno ’im. there ain’t such person ’ere; i never
 ’eard of ’im in all my bloomin’ days. don’t believe there ain’t nobody
 of that kind livin’ ere or anywheres.” i took out smollet’s letter, and
 as i read it it seemed to that the lesson of the spelling of the name
 of the court might guide me. “what are you?” i asked.
 
“i’m the depity,” answered. i saw at once that i was on the right
 track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. half-crown tip put the
 deputy’s knowledge at my disposal, and i learned that mr. bloxam, who
 had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at
 corcoran’s, had left for his work at poplar at five o’clock that
 morning. could not tell where the place of work was situated, but
 had vague idea that it was some kind of “new-fangled ware’us”;
 and with this slender clue i had to start for poplar. it was twelve
 o’clock before i got any satisfactory hint of such building, and this
 i got at coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. one
 of these suggested that there was being erected at cross angel street a
 new “cold storage” building; and as this suited the condition of a
 “new-fangled ware’us,” i at once drove to it. an interview with surly
 gatekeeper and surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the
 coin of the realm, put on the track of bloxam; was sent for on my
 suggesting that i was willing to pay his day’s wages to his foreman for
 the privilege of asking him few questions on private matter. was
 smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. when i had
 promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, told me
 that had made two journeys between carfax and house in piccadilly,
 and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--“main
 heavy ones”--with horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. i
 asked him if could tell the number of the house in piccadilly, to
 which replied:--
 
“well, guv’nor, i forgits the number, but it was only few doors from a
 big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. it was a
 dusty old ’ouse, too, though nothin’ to the dustiness of the ’ouse we
 tooked the bloomin’ boxes from.”
 
“how did you get into the houses if they were both empty?”
 
“there was the old party what engaged a-waitin’ in the ’ouse at
 purfleet. ’elped to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. curse
 me, but was the strongest chap i ever struck, an’ him old feller,
 with white moustache, one that thin you would think couldn’t throw
 shadder.”
 
how this phrase thrilled through me!
 
“why, ’e took up ’is end o’ the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and
 a-puffin’ an’ a-blowin’ afore i could up-end mine anyhow--an’ i’m no
 chicken, neither.”
 
“how did you get into the house in piccadilly?” i asked.
 
“he was there too. must ’a’ started off and got there afore me, for
 when i rung of the bell kem an’ opened the door ’isself an’ ’elped me
 to carry the boxes into the ’all.”
 
“the whole nine?” i asked.
 
“yus; there was five in the first load an’ four in the second. it was
 main dry work, an’ i don’t so well remember ’ow i got ’ome.” i
 interrupted him:--
 
“were the boxes left in the hall?”
 
“yus; it was big ’all, an’ there was nothin’ else in it.” i made one
 more attempt to further matters:--
 
“you didn’t have any key?”
 
“never used key nor nothink. the old gent, opened the door ’isself
 an’ shut it again when i druv off. i don’t remember the last time--but
 that was the beer.”
 
“and you can’t remember the number of the house?”
 
“no, sir. but ye needn’t have difficulty about that. it’s ’igh ’un
 with stone front with bow on it, an’ ’igh steps up to the door. i
 know them steps, ’avin’ ’ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers
 what come round to earn copper. the old gent give them shillin’s, an’
 they seein’ they got so much, they wanted more; but ’e took one of them
 by the shoulder and was like to throw ’im down the steps, till the lot
 of them went away cussin’.” i thought that with this description i could
 find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, i started
 off for piccadilly. i had gained new painful experience; the count
 could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. if so, time was
 precious; for, now that had achieved certain amount of
 distribution, could, by choosing his own time, complete the task
 unobserved. at piccadilly circus i discharged my cab, and walked
 westward; beyond the junior constitutional i came across the house
 described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs
 arranged by dracula. the house looked as though it had been long
 untenanted. the windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were
 up. all the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint
 had mostly scaled away. it was evident that up to lately there had been
 large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been
 roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.
 behind the rails of the balcony i saw there were some loose boards,
 whose raw edges looked white. i would have given good deal to have
 been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have
 given some clue to the ownership of the house. i remembered my
 experience of the investigation and purchase of carfax, and i could not
 but feel that if i could find the former owner there might be some means
 discovered of gaining access to the house.
 
there was at present nothing to be learned from the piccadilly side, and
 nothing could be done; so i went round to the back to see if anything
 could be gathered from this quarter. the mews were active, the
 piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. i asked one or two of the
 grooms and helpers whom i saw around if they could tell anything
 about the empty house. one of them said that heard it had lately been
 taken, but couldn’t say from whom. told me, however, that up to
 very lately there had been notice-board of “for sale” up, and that
 perhaps mitchell, sons, & candy, the house agents, could tell me
 something, as thought remembered seeing the name of that firm on
 the board. i did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know
 or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, i strolled
 away. it was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so i
 did not lose any time. having learned the address of mitchell, sons, &
 candy from directory at the berkeley, i was soon at their office in
 sackville street.
 
the gentleman who saw was particularly suave in manner, but
 uncommunicative in equal proportion. having once told that the
 piccadilly house--which throughout our interview called a
 “mansion”--was sold, considered my business as concluded. when i
 asked who had purchased it, opened his eyes thought wider, and
 paused few seconds before replying:--
 
“it is sold, sir.”
 
“pardon me,” i said, with equal politeness, “but i have special reason
 for wishing to know who purchased it.”
 
again paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. “it is sold,
 sir,” was again his laconic reply.
 
“surely,” i said, “you do not mind letting know so much.”
 
“but i do mind,” answered. “the affairs of their clients are
 absolutely safe in the hands of mitchell, sons, & candy.” this was
 manifestly prig of the first water, and there was use arguing with
 him. i thought i had best meet him on his own ground, so i said:--
 
“your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute guardian of their
 confidence. i am myself professional man.” here i handed him my card.
 “in this instance i am not prompted by curiosity; i act on the part of
 lord godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,
 understood, lately for sale.” these words put different complexion
 on affairs. said:--
 
“i would like to oblige you if i could, mr. harker, and especially would
 i like to oblige his lordship. we once carried out small matter of
 renting some chambers for him when was the honourable arthur
 holmwood. if you will let have his lordship’s address i will consult
 the house on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his
 lordship by to-night’s post. it will be pleasure if we can so far
 deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his
 lordship.”
 
i wanted to secure friend, and not to make an enemy, so i thanked him,
 gave the address at dr. seward’s and came away. it was now dark, and i
 was tired and hungry. i got cup of tea at the aërated bread company
 and came down to purfleet by the next train.
 
i found all the others at home. mina was looking tired and pale, but she
 made gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to
 think that i had had to keep anything from her and so caused her
 inquietude. thank god, this will be the last night of her looking on at
 our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our
 confidence. it took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of
 keeping her out of our grim task. she seems somehow more reconciled; or
 else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when
 any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. i am glad we
 made our resolution in time, as with such feeling as this, our growing
 knowledge would be torture to her.
 
i could not tell the others of the day’s discovery till we were alone;
 so after dinner--followed by little music to save appearances even
 amongst ourselves--i took mina to her room and left her to go to bed.
 the dear girl was more affectionate with than ever, and clung to me
 as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and i
 came away. thank god, the ceasing of telling things has made no
 difference between us.
 
when i came down again i found the others all gathered round the fire in
 the study. in the train i had written my diary so far, and simply read
 it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own
 information; when i had finished helsing said:--
 
“this has been great day’s work, friend jonathan. doubtless we are on
 the track of the missing boxes. if we find them all in that house, then
 our work is near the end. but if there be some missing, we must search
 until we find them. then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the
 wretch to his real death.” we all sat silent awhile and all at once mr.
 morris spoke:--
 
“say! how are we going to get into that house?”
 
“we got into the other,” answered lord godalming quickly.
 
“but, art, this is different. we broke house at carfax, but we had night
 and walled park to protect us. it will be mighty different thing to
 commit burglary in piccadilly, either by day or night. i confess i don’t
 see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us key
 of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the
 morning.” lord godalming’s brows contracted, and stood up and walked
 about the room. by-and-by stopped and said, turning from one to
 another of us:--
 
“quincey’s head is level. this burglary business is getting serious; we
 got off once all right; but we have now rare job on hand--unless we
 can find the count’s key basket.”
 
as nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at
 least advisable to wait till lord godalming should hear from mitchell’s,
 we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. for good
 while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and
 bearings; i took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the
 moment. i am very sleepy and shall go to bed....
 
just line. mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. her
 forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even
 in her sleep. she is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she
 did this morning. to-morrow will, i hope, mend all this; she will be
 herself at home in exeter. oh, but i am sleepy!
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_1 october._--i am puzzled afresh about renfield. his moods change so
 rapidly that i find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they
 always mean something more than his own well-being, they form more
 than interesting study. this morning, when i went to see him after his
 repulse of helsing, his manner was that of man commanding destiny.
 was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. did not really
 care for any of the things of mere earth; was in the clouds and
 looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. i
 thought i would improve the occasion and learn something, so i asked
 him:--
 
“what about the flies these times?” smiled on in quite superior
 sort of way--such smile as would have become the face of malvolio--as
 answered me:--
 
“the fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical
 of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. the ancients did well
 when they typified the soul as butterfly!”
 
i thought i would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so i said
 quickly:--
 
“oh, it is soul you are after now, is it?” his madness foiled his
 reason, and puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head
 with decision which i had but seldom seen in him, said:--
 
“oh, no, oh no! i want souls. life is all i want.” here brightened
 up; “i am pretty indifferent about it at present. life is all right; i
 have all i want. you must get new patient, doctor, if you wish to
 study zoöphagy!”
 
this puzzled little, so i drew him on:--
 
“then you command life; you are god, i suppose?” smiled with an
 ineffably benign superiority.
 
“oh no! far be it from to arrogate to myself the attributes of the
 deity. i am not even concerned in his especially spiritual doings. if i
 may state my intellectual position i am, so far as concerns things
 purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which enoch occupied
 spiritually!” this was poser to me. i could not at the moment recall
 enoch’s appositeness; so i had to ask simple question, though i felt
 that by so doing i was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--
 
“and why with enoch?”
 
“because walked with god.” i could not see the analogy, but did not
 like to admit it; so i harked back to what had denied:--
 
“so you don’t care about life and you don’t want souls. why not?” i put
 my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.
 the effort succeeded; for an instant unconsciously relapsed into his
 old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon as
 replied:--
 
“i don’t want any souls, indeed, indeed! i don’t. i couldn’t use them if
 i had them; they would be manner of use to me. i couldn’t eat them
 or----” suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his
 face, like wind-sweep on the surface of the water. “and doctor, as to
 life, what is it after all? when you’ve got all you require, and you
 know that you will never want, that is all. i have friends--good
 friends--like you, dr. seward”; this was said with leer of
 inexpressible cunning. “i know that i shall never lack the means of
 life!”
 
i think that through the cloudiness of his insanity saw some
 antagonism in me, for at once fell back on the last refuge of such as
 he--a dogged silence. after short time i saw that for the present it
 was useless to speak to him. was sulky, and so i came away.
 
later in the day sent for me. ordinarily i would not have come
 without special reason, but just at present i am so interested in him
 that i would gladly make an effort. besides, i am glad to have anything
 to help to pass the time. harker is out, following up clues; and so are
 lord godalming and quincey. helsing sits in my study poring over the
 record prepared by the harkers; seems to think that by accurate
 knowledge of all details will light upon some clue. does not wish
 to be disturbed in the work, without cause. i would have taken him with
 to see the patient, only i thought that after his last repulse he
 might not care to go again. there was also another reason: renfield
 might not speak so freely before third person as when and i were
 alone.
 
i found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, pose
 which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. when i
 came in, said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his
 lips:--
 
“what about souls?” it was evident then that my surmise had been
 correct. unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the
 lunatic. i determined to have the matter out. “what about them
 yourself?” i asked. did not reply for moment but looked all round
 him, and up and down, as though expected to find some inspiration for
 an answer.
 
“i don’t want any souls!” said in feeble, apologetic way. the
 matter seemed preying on his mind, and so i determined to use it--to “be
 cruel only to be kind.” so i said:--
 
“you like life, and you want life?”
 
“oh yes! but that is all right; you needn’t worry about that!”
 
“but,” i asked, “how are we to get the life without getting the soul
 also?” this seemed to puzzle him, so i followed it up:--
 
“a nice time you’ll have some time when you’re flying out there, with
 the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing
 and twittering and miauing all round you. you’ve got their lives, you
 know, and you must put up with their souls!” something seemed to affect
 his imagination, for put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,
 screwing them up tightly just as small boy does when his face is being
 soaped. there was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave
 lesson, for it seemed that before was child--only child,
 though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. it
 was evident that was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,
 and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign
 to himself, i thought i would enter into his mind as well as i could and
 go with him. the first step was to restore confidence, so i asked him,
 speaking pretty loud so that would hear through his closed ears:--
 
“would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?” seemed to
 wake up all at once, and shook his head. with laugh replied:--
 
“not much! flies are poor things, after all!” after pause added,
 “but i don’t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.”
 
“or spiders?” i went on.
 
“blow spiders! what’s the use of spiders? there isn’t anything in them
 to eat or”--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of forbidden
 topic.
 
“so, so!” i thought to myself, “this is the second time has suddenly
 stopped at the word ‘drink’; what does it mean?” renfield seemed himself
 aware of having made lapse, for hurried on, as though to distract
 my attention from it:--
 
“i don’t take any stock at all in such matters. ‘rats and mice and such
 small deer,’ as shakespeare has it, ‘chicken-feed of the larder’ they
 might be called. i’m past all that sort of nonsense. you might as well
 ask man to eat molecules with pair of chop-sticks, as to try to
 interest about the lesser carnivora, when i know of what is before
 me.”
 
“i see,” i said. “you want big things that you can make your teeth meet
 in? how would you like to breakfast on elephant?”
 
“what ridiculous nonsense you are talking!” was getting too wide
 awake, so i thought i would press him hard. “i wonder,” i said
 reflectively, “what an elephant’s soul is like!”
 
the effect i desired was obtained, for at once fell from his
 high-horse and became child again.
 
“i don’t want an elephant’s soul, or any soul at all!” said. for a
 few moments sat despondently. suddenly jumped to his feet, with
 his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. “to
 hell with you and your souls!” shouted. “why do you plague about
 souls? haven’t i got enough to worry, and pain, and distract already,
 without thinking of souls!” looked so hostile that i thought was
 in for another homicidal fit, so i blew my whistle. the instant,
 however, that i did so became calm, and said apologetically:--
 
“forgive me, doctor; i forgot myself. you do not need any help. i am so
 worried in my mind that i am apt to be irritable. if you only knew the
 problem i have to face, and that i am working out, you would pity, and
 tolerate, and pardon me. pray do not put in strait-waistcoat. i
 want to think and i cannot think freely when my body is confined. i am
 sure you will understand!” had evidently self-control; so when the
 attendants came i told them not to mind, and they withdrew. renfield
 watched them go; when the door was closed said, with considerable
 dignity and sweetness:--
 
“dr. seward, you have been very considerate towards me. believe that
 i am very, very grateful to you!” i thought it well to leave him in this
 mood, and so i came away. there is certainly something to ponder over in
 this man’s state. several points seem to make what the american
 interviewer calls “a story,” if one could only get them in proper order.
 here they are:--
 
will not mention “drinking.”
 
fears the thought of being burdened with the “soul” of anything.
 
has dread of wanting “life” in the future.
 
despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though dreads being
 haunted by their souls.
 
logically all these things point one way! has assurance of some kind
 that will acquire some higher life. dreads the consequence--the
 burden of soul. then it is human life looks to!
 
and the assurance--?
 
merciful god! the count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of
 terror afoot!
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--i went after my round to helsing and told him my
 suspicion. grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a
 while asked to take him to renfield. i did so. as we came to the door
 we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as used to do in the time
 which now seems so long ago. when we entered we saw with amazement that
 had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the
 autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. we tried to make him talk
 of the subject of our previous conversation, but would not attend. he
 went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. had
 got scrap of paper and was folding it into note-book. we had to come
 away as ignorant as we went in.
 
his is curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.
 

_letter, mitchell, sons and candy to lord godalming._
 
_“1 october._
 
“my lord,
 
“we are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. we beg, with
 regard to the desire of your lordship, expressed by mr. harker on your
 behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and
 purchase of no. 347, piccadilly. the original vendors are the executors
 of the late mr. archibald winter-suffield. the purchaser is foreign
 nobleman, count ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the
 purchase money in notes ‘over the counter,’ if your lordship will pardon
 us using so vulgar an expression. beyond this we know nothing whatever
 of him.
 
“we are, my lord,
 
“your lordship’s humble servants,
 
“mitchell, sons & candy.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_2 october._--i placed man in the corridor last night, and told him to
 make an accurate note of any sound might hear from renfield’s room,
 and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he
 was to call me. after dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire
 in the study--mrs. harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts
 and discoveries of the day. harker was the only one who had any result,
 and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.
 
before going to bed i went round to the patient’s room and looked in
 through the observation trap. was sleeping soundly, and his heart
 rose and fell with regular respiration.
 
this morning the man on duty reported to that little after midnight
 was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. i asked him
 if that was all; replied that it was all heard. there was
 something about his manner so suspicious that i asked him point blank if
 had been asleep. denied sleep, but admitted to having “dozed” for
 while. it is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are
 watched.
 
to-day harker is out following up his clue, and art and quincey are
 looking after horses. godalming thinks that it will be well to have
 horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we
 seek there will be time to lose. we must sterilise all the imported
 earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the count at his
 weakest, and without refuge to fly to. helsing is off to the
 british museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. the old
 physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,
 and the professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be
 useful to us later.
 
i sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in
 strait-waistcoats.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--we have met again. we seem at last to be on the track, and our
 work of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. i wonder if
 renfield’s quiet has anything to do with this. his moods have so
 followed the doings of the count, that the coming destruction of the
 monster may be carried to him in some subtle way. if we could only get
 some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument
 with him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a
 valuable clue. is now seemingly quiet for spell.... is he?---- that
 wild yell seemed to come from his room....
 
* * * * *
 
the attendant came bursting into my room and told that renfield had
 somehow met with some accident. had heard him yell; and when went
 to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.
 i must go at once....
 



chapter xxi
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_3 october._--let put down with exactness all that happened, as well
 as i can remember it, since last i made an entry. not detail that i
 can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness i must proceed.
 
when i came to renfield’s room i found him lying on the floor on his
 left side in glittering pool of blood. when i went to move him, it
 became at once apparent that had received some terrible injuries;
 there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body
 which marks even lethargic sanity. as the face was exposed i could see
 that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the
 floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood
 originated. the attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to as
 we turned him over:--
 
“i think, sir, his back is broken. see, both his right arm and leg and
 the whole side of his face are paralysed.” how such thing could have
 happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. seemed quite
 bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as said:--
 
“i can’t understand the two things. could mark his face like that by
 beating his own head on the floor. i saw young woman do it once at the
 eversfield asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. and i suppose he
 might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if got in an awkward
 kink. but for the life of i can’t imagine how the two things
 occurred. if his back was broke, couldn’t beat his head; and if his
 face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of
 it.” i said to him:--
 
“go to dr. helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. i want
 him without an instant’s delay.” the man ran off, and within few
 minutes the professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. when
 saw renfield on the ground, looked keenly at him moment, and
 then turned to me. i think recognised my thought in my eyes, for he
 said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--
 
“ah, sad accident! will need very careful watching, and much
 attention. i shall stay with you myself; but i shall first dress myself.
 if you will remain i shall in few minutes join you.”
 
the patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that
 had suffered some terrible injury. helsing returned with
 extraordinary celerity, bearing with him surgical case. had
 evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he
 looked at the patient, whispered to me:--
 
“send the attendant away. we must be alone with him when becomes
 conscious, after the operation.” so i said:--
 
“i think that will do now, simmons. we have done all that we can at
 present. you had better go your round, and dr. helsing will operate.
 let know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.”
 
the man withdrew, and we went into strict examination of the patient.
 the wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was depressed
 fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. the
 professor thought moment and said:--
 
“we must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far
 as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of
 his injury. the whole motor area seems affected. the suffusion of the
 brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be
 too late.” as was speaking there was soft tapping at the door. i
 went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, arthur and
 quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--
 
“i heard your man call up dr. helsing and tell him of an accident.
 so i woke quincey or rather called for him as was not asleep. things
 are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us
 these times. i’ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things
 as they have been. we’ll have to look back--and forward little more
 than we have done. may we come in?” i nodded, and held the door open
 till they had entered; then i closed it again. when quincey saw the
 attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the
 floor, said softly:--
 
“my god! what has happened to him? poor, poor devil!” i told him
 briefly, and added that we expected would recover consciousness after
 the operation--for short time, at all events. went at once and sat
 down on the edge of the bed, with godalming beside him; we all watched
 in patience.
 
“we shall wait,” said helsing, “just long enough to fix the best
 spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove
 the blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing.”
 
the minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. i had a
 horrible sinking in my heart, and from helsing’s face i gathered
 that felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. i dreaded
 the words that renfield might speak. i was positively afraid to think;
 but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as i have read of men
 who have heard the death-watch. the poor man’s breathing came in
 uncertain gasps. each instant seemed as though would open his eyes
 and speak; but then would follow prolonged stertorous breath, and he
 would relapse into more fixed insensibility. inured as i was to sick
 beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. i could almost
 hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my
 temples sounded like blows from hammer. the silence finally became
 agonising. i looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from
 their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal
 torture. there was nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead
 some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect
 it.
 
at last there came time when it was evident that the patient was
 sinking fast; might die at any moment. i looked up at the professor
 and caught his eyes fixed on mine. his face was sternly set as he
 spoke:--
 
“there is time to lose. his words may be worth many lives; i have
 been thinking so, as i stood here. it may be there is soul at stake!
 we shall operate just above the ear.”
 
without another word made the operation. for few moments the
 breathing continued to be stertorous. then there came breath so
 prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.
 suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in wild, helpless stare.
 this was continued for few moments; then it softened into glad
 surprise, and from the lips came sigh of relief. moved
 convulsively, and as did so, said:--
 
“i’ll be quiet, doctor. tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. i
 have had terrible dream, and it has left so weak that i cannot
 move. what’s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts
 dreadfully.” tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his
 eyes seemed to grow glassy again so i gently put it back. then van
 helsing said in quiet grave tone:--
 
“tell us your dream, mr. renfield.” as heard the voice his face
 brightened, through its mutilation, and said:--
 
“that is dr. helsing. how good it is of you to be here. give some
 water, my lips are dry; and i shall try to tell you. i dreamed”--he
 stopped and seemed fainting, i called quietly to quincey--“the
 brandy--it is in my study--quick!” flew and returned with glass,
 the decanter of brandy and carafe of water. we moistened the parched
 lips, and the patient quickly revived. it seemed, however, that his poor
 injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when was quite
 conscious, looked at piercingly with an agonised confusion which i
 shall never forget, and said:--
 
“i must not deceive myself; it was dream, but all grim reality.”
 then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two
 figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed went on:--
 
“if i were not sure already, i would know from them.” for an instant his
 eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though were
 bringing all his faculties to bear; when opened them said,
 hurriedly, and with more energy than had yet displayed:--
 
“quick, doctor, quick. i am dying! i feel that i have but few minutes;
 and then i must go back to death--or worse! wet my lips with brandy
 again. i have something that i must say before i die; or before my poor
 crushed brain dies anyhow. thank you! it was that night after you left
 me, when i implored you to let go away. i couldn’t speak then, for i
 felt my tongue was tied; but i was as sane then, except in that way, as
 i am now. i was in an agony of despair for long time after you left
 me; it seemed hours. then there came sudden peace to me. my brain
 seemed to become cool again, and i realised where i was. i heard the
 dogs bark behind our house, but not where was!” as spoke, van
 helsing’s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and
 gripped it hard. did not, however, betray himself; nodded slightly
 and said: “go on,” in low voice. renfield proceeded:--
 
“he came up to the window in the mist, as i had seen him often before;
 but was solid then--not ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a
 man’s when angry. was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white
 teeth glinted in the moonlight when turned to look back over the belt
 of trees, to where the dogs were barking. i wouldn’t ask him to come in
 at first, though i knew wanted to--just as had wanted all along.
 then began promising things--not in words but by doing them.” he
 was interrupted by word from the professor:--
 
“how?”
 
“by making them happen; just as used to send in the flies when the
 sun was shining. great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their
 wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their
 backs.” helsing nodded to him as whispered to unconsciously:--
 
“the _acherontia aitetropos of the sphinges_--what you call the
 ‘death’s-head moth’?” the patient went on without stopping.
 
“then began to whisper: ‘rats, rats, rats! hundreds, thousands,
 millions of them, and every one life; and dogs to eat them, and cats
 too. all lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely
 buzzing flies!’ i laughed at him, for i wanted to see what could do.
 then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in his house. he
 beckoned to the window. i got up and looked out, and raised his
 hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. dark mass
 spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of flame of fire; and
 then moved the mist to the right and left, and i could see that there
 were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like his, only
 smaller. held up his hand, and they all stopped; and i thought he
 seemed to be saying: ‘all these lives will i give you, ay, and many more
 and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship
 me!’ and then red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close
 over my eyes; and before i knew what i was doing, i found myself opening
 the sash and saying to him: ‘come in, lord and master!’ the rats were
 all gone, but slid into the room through the sash, though it was only
 open an inch wide--just as the moon herself has often come in through
 the tiniest crack and has stood before in all her size and
 splendour.”
 
his voice was weaker, so i moistened his lips with the brandy again, and
 continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in
 the interval for his story was further advanced. i was about to call him
 back to the point, but helsing whispered to me: “let him go on. do
 not interrupt him; cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all
 if once lost the thread of his thought.” proceeded:--
 
“all day i waited to hear from him, but did not send anything, not
 even blow-fly, and when the moon got up i was pretty angry with him.
 when slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even
 knock, i got mad with him. sneered at me, and his white face looked
 out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and went on as though he
 owned the whole place, and i was one. didn’t even smell the same
 as went by me. i couldn’t hold him. i thought that, somehow, mrs.
 harker had come into the room.”
 
the two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind
 him so that could not see them, but where they could hear better.
 they were both silent, but the professor started and quivered; his face,
 however, grew grimmer and sterner still. renfield went on without
 noticing:--
 
“when mrs. harker came in to see this afternoon she wasn’t the same;
 it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.” here we all moved,
 but one said word; went on:--
 
“i didn’t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn’t look the
 same. i don’t care for the pale people; i like them with lots of blood
 in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. i didn’t think of it
 at the time; but when she went away i began to think, and it made mad
 to know that had been taking the life out of her.” i could feel that
 the rest quivered, as i did, but we remained otherwise still. “so when
 came to-night i was ready for him. i saw the mist stealing in, and i
 grabbed it tight. i had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and
 as i knew i was madman--at times anyhow--i resolved to use my power.
 ay, and felt it too, for had to come out of the mist to struggle
 with me. i held tight; and i thought i was going to win, for i didn’t
 mean him to take any more of her life, till i saw his eyes. they burned
 into me, and my strength became like water. slipped through it, and
 when i tried to cling to him, raised up and flung down. there
 was red cloud before me, and noise like thunder, and the mist seemed
 to steal away under the door.” his voice was becoming fainter and his
 breath more stertorous. helsing stood up instinctively.
 
“we know the worst now,” said. “he is here, and we know his purpose.
 it may not be too late. let us be armed--the same as we were the other
 night, but lose time; there is not an instant to spare.” there was no
 need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in
 common. we all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we
 had when we entered the count’s house. the professor had his ready, and
 as we met in the corridor pointed to them significantly as said:--
 
“they never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is
 over. be wise also, my friends. it is common enemy that we deal with.
 alas! alas! that that dear madam mina should suffer!” stopped; his
 voice was breaking, and i do not know if rage or terror predominated in
 my own heart.
 
outside the harkers’ door we paused. art and quincey held back, and the
 latter said:--
 
“should we disturb her?”
 
“we must,” said helsing grimly. “if the door be locked, i shall
 break it in.”
 
“may it not frighten her terribly? it is unusual to break into lady’s
 room!”
 
helsing said solemnly, “you are always right; but this is life and
 death. all chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they
 are all as one to to-night. friend john, when i turn the handle, if
 the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you
 too, my friends. now!”
 
turned the handle as spoke, but the door did not yield. we threw
 ourselves against it; with crash it burst open, and we almost fell
 headlong into the room. the professor did actually fall, and i saw
 across him as gathered himself up from hands and knees. what i saw
 appalled me. i felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,
 and my heart seemed to stand still.
 
the moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room
 was light enough to see. on the bed beside the window lay jonathan
 harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in stupor.
 kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad
 figure of his wife. by her side stood tall, thin man, clad in black.
 his face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised
 the count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. with his left
 hand held both mrs. harker’s hands, keeping them away with her arms
 at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,
 forcing her face down on his bosom. her white nightdress was smeared
 with blood, and thin stream trickled down the man’s bare breast which
 was shown by his torn-open dress. the attitude of the two had terrible
 resemblance to child forcing kitten’s nose into saucer of milk to
 compel it to drink. as we burst into the room, the count turned his
 face, and the hellish look that i had heard described seemed to leap
 into it. his eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils
 of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the
 white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,
 champed together like those of wild beast. with wrench, which threw
 his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from height, turned
 and sprang at us. but by this time the professor had gained his feet,
 and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the sacred
 wafer. the count suddenly stopped, just as poor lucy had done outside
 the tomb, and cowered back. further and further back cowered, as we,
 lifting our crucifixes, advanced. the moonlight suddenly failed, as a
 great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up
 under quincey’s match, we saw nothing but faint vapour. this, as we
 looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting
 open, had swung back to its old position. helsing, art, and i moved
 forward to mrs. harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with
 it had given scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it
 seems to now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. for a
 few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. her face was
 ghastly, with pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared
 her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled thin stream of
 blood; her eyes were mad with terror. then she put before her face her
 poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the
 count’s terrible grip, and from behind them came low desolate wail
 which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an
 endless grief. helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently
 over her body, whilst art, after looking at her face for an instant
 despairingly, ran out of the room. helsing whispered to me:--
 
“jonathan is in stupor such as we know the vampire can produce. we can
 do nothing with poor madam mina for few moments till she recovers
 herself; i must wake him!” dipped the end of towel in cold water
 and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while
 holding her face between her hands and sobbing in way that was
 heart-breaking to hear. i raised the blind, and looked out of the
 window. there was much moonshine; and as i looked i could see quincey
 morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of great
 yew-tree. it puzzled to think why was doing this; but at the
 instant i heard harker’s quick exclamation as woke to partial
 consciousness, and turned to the bed. on his face, as there might well
 be, was look of wild amazement. seemed dazed for few seconds, and
 then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he
 started up. his wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to
 him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,
 however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held
 her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.
 
“in god’s name what does this mean?” harker cried out. “dr. seward, dr.
 helsing, what is it? what has happened? what is wrong? mina, dear,
 what is it? what does that blood mean? my god, my god! has it come to
 this!” and, raising himself to his knees, beat his hands wildly
 together. “good god help us! help her! oh, help her!” with quick
 movement jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the
 man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. “what has happened?
 tell all about it!” cried without pausing. “dr. helsing, you
 love mina, i know. oh, do something to save her. it cannot have gone too
 far yet. guard her while i look for _him_!” his wife, through her terror
 and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly
 forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--
 
“no! no! jonathan, you must not leave me. i have suffered enough
 to-night, god knows, without the dread of his harming you. you must stay
 with me. stay with these friends who will watch over you!” her
 expression became frantic as she spoke; and, yielding to her, she
 pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.
 
helsing and i tried to calm them both. the professor held up his
 little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--
 
“do not fear, my dear. we are here; and whilst this is close to you no
 foul thing can approach. you are safe for to-night; and we must be calm
 and take counsel together.” she shuddered and was silent, holding down
 her head on her husband’s breast. when she raised it, his white
 night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where
 the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. the instant she
 saw it she drew back, with low wail, and whispered, amidst choking
 sobs:--
 
“unclean, unclean! i must touch him or kiss him more. oh, that it
 should be that it is i who am now his worst enemy, and whom may have
 most cause to fear.” to this spoke out resolutely:--
 
“nonsense, mina. it is shame to to hear such word. i would not
 hear it of you; and i shall not hear it from you. may god judge by my
 deserts, and punish with more bitter suffering than even this hour,
 if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!” put out
 his arms and folded her to his breast; and for while she lay there
 sobbing. looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked
 damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. after a
 while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then said to
 me, speaking with studied calmness which i felt tried his nervous
 power to the utmost:--
 
“and now, dr. seward, tell all about it. too well i know the broad
 fact; tell all that has been.” i told him exactly what had happened,
 and listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched
 and his eyes blazed as i told how the ruthless hands of the count had
 held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to
 the open wound in his breast. it interested me, even at that moment, to
 see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over
 the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled
 hair. just as i had finished, quincey and godalming knocked at the door.
 they entered in obedience to our summons. helsing looked at me
 questioningly. i understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of
 their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband
 and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence
 to him asked them what they had seen or done. to which lord godalming
 answered:--
 
“i could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. i
 looked in the study but, though had been there, had gone. had,
 however----” stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on
 the bed. helsing said gravely:--
 
“go on, friend arthur. we want here more concealments. our hope now
 is in knowing all. tell freely!” so art went on:--
 
“he had been there, and though it could only have been for few
 seconds, made rare of the place. all the manuscript had been
 burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the
 cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax
 had helped the flames.” here i interrupted. “thank god there is the
 other copy in the safe!” his face lit for moment, but fell again as he
 went on: “i ran downstairs then, but could see sign of him. i looked
 into renfield’s room; but there was trace there except----!” again he
 paused. “go on,” said harker hoarsely; so bowed his head and
 moistening his lips with his tongue, added: “except that the poor fellow
 is dead.” mrs. harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of
 us she said solemnly:--
 
“god’s will be done!” i could not but feel that art was keeping back
 something; but, as i took it that it was with purpose, i said nothing.
 helsing turned to morris and asked:--
 
“and you, friend quincey, have you any to tell?”
 
“a little,” answered. “it may be much eventually, but at present i
 can’t say. i thought it well to know if possible where the count would
 go when left the house. i did not see him; but i saw bat rise from
 renfield’s window, and flap westward. i expected to see him in some
 shape go back to carfax; but evidently sought some other lair. he
 will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the
 dawn is close. we must work to-morrow!”
 
said the latter words through his shut teeth. for space of perhaps
 couple of minutes there was silence, and i could fancy that i could
 hear the sound of our hearts beating; then helsing said, placing his
 hand very tenderly on mrs. harker’s head:--
 
“and now, madam mina--poor, dear, dear madam mina--tell us exactly what
 happened. god knows that i do not want that you be pained; but it is
 need that we know all. for now more than ever has all work to be done
 quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. the day is close to us that must
 end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and
 learn.”
 
the poor, dear lady shivered, and i could see the tension of her nerves
 as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and
 lower still on his breast. then she raised her head proudly, and held
 out one hand to helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and
 kissing it reverently, held it fast. the other hand was locked in that
 of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.
 after pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she
 began:--
 
“i took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a
 long time it did not act. i seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads
 of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them
 connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.”
 her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said
 lovingly: “do not fret, dear. you must be brave and strong, and help me
 through the horrible task. if you only knew what an effort it is to me
 to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much i
 need your help. well, i saw i must try to help the medicine to its work
 with my will, if it was to do any good, so i resolutely set myself to
 sleep. sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for i remember no
 more. jonathan coming in had not waked me, for lay by my side when
 next i remember. there was in the room the same thin white mist that i
 had before noticed. but i forget now if you know of this; you will find
 it in my diary which i shall show you later. i felt the same vague
 terror which had come to before and the same sense of some presence.
 i turned to wake jonathan, but found that slept so soundly that it
 seemed as if it was who had taken the sleeping draught, and not i. i
 tried, but i could not wake him. this caused great fear, and i
 looked around terrified. then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside
 the bed, as if had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist
 had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a
 tall, thin man, all in black. i knew him at once from the description of
 the others. the waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light
 fell in thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white
 teeth showing between; and the red eyes that i had seemed to see in the
 sunset on the windows of st. mary’s church at whitby. i knew, too, the
 red scar on his forehead where jonathan had struck him. for an instant
 my heart stood still, and i would have screamed out, only that i was
 paralysed. in the pause spoke in sort of keen, cutting whisper,
 pointing as spoke to jonathan:--
 
“‘silence! if you make sound i shall take him and dash his brains out
 before your very eyes.’ i was appalled and was too bewildered to do or
 say anything. with mocking smile, placed one hand upon my shoulder
 and, holding tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as did
 so, ‘first, little refreshment to reward my exertions. you may as well
 be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have
 appeased my thirst!’ i was bewildered, and, strangely enough, i did not
 want to hinder him. i suppose it is part of the horrible curse that
 such is, when his touch is on his victim. and oh, my god, my god, pity
 me! placed his reeking lips upon my throat!” her husband groaned
 again. she clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if
 were the injured one, and went on:--
 
“i felt my strength fading away, and i was in half swoon. how long
 this horrible thing lasted i know not; but it seemed that long time
 must have passed before took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. i
 saw it drip with the fresh blood!” the remembrance seemed for while to
 overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her
 husband’s sustaining arm. with great effort she recovered herself and
 went on:--
 
“then spoke to mockingly, ‘and so you, like the others, would play
 your brains against mine. you would help these men to hunt and
 frustrate in my designs! you know now, and they know in part already,
 and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. they
 should have kept their energies for use closer to home. whilst they
 played wits against me--against who commanded nations, and intrigued
 for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were
 born--i was countermining them. and you, their best beloved one, are now
 to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful
 wine-press for while; and shall be later on my companion and my
 helper. you shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall
 minister to your needs. but as yet you are to be punished for what you
 have done. you have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my
 call. when my brain says “come!” to you, you shall cross land or to
 do my bidding; and to that end this!’ with that pulled open his
 shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened vein in his breast. when
 the blood began to spurt out, took my hands in one of his, holding
 them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to
 the wound, so that i must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- oh
 my god! my god! what have i done? what have i done to deserve such a
 fate, i who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my
 days. god pity me! look down on poor soul in worse than mortal peril;
 and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!” then she began to rub her
 lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.
 
as she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,
 and everything became more and more clear. harker was still and quiet;
 but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came grey look
 which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first
 red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out
 against the whitening hair.
 
we have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy
 pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.
 
of this i am sure: the sun rises to-day on more miserable house in
 all the great round of its daily course.
 



chapter xxii
 
jonathan harker’s journal
 

_3 october._--as i must do something or go mad, i write this diary. it
 is now six o’clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and
 take something to eat; for dr. helsing and dr. seward are agreed
 that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. our best will be, god
 knows, required to-day. i must keep writing at every chance, for i dare
 not stop to think. all, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end
 the little things may teach us most. the teaching, big or little, could
 not have landed mina or anywhere worse than we are to-day. however,
 we must trust and hope. poor mina told just now, with the tears
 running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our
 faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that god will aid us
 up to the end. the end! oh my god! what end?... to work! to work!
 
when dr. helsing and dr. seward had come back from seeing poor
 renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. first, dr. seward
 told us that when and dr. helsing had gone down to the room below
 they had found renfield lying on the floor, all in heap. his face was
 all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.
 
dr. seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if had
 heard anything. said that had been sitting down--he confessed to
 half dozing--when heard loud voices in the room, and then renfield
 had called out loudly several times, “god! god! god!” after that there
 was sound of falling, and when entered the room found him lying
 on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. helsing
 asked if had heard “voices” or “a voice,” and said could not
 say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as
 there was one in the room it could have been only one. could swear
 to it, if required, that the word “god” was spoken by the patient. dr.
 seward said to us, when we were alone, that did not wish to go into
 the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it
 would never do to put forward the truth, as one would believe it. as
 it was, thought that on the attendant’s evidence could give a
 certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. in case the
 coroner should demand it, there would be formal inquest, necessarily
 to the same result.
 
when the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next
 step, the very first thing we decided was that mina should be in full
 confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be
 kept from her. she herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful
 to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such depth of
 despair. “there must be concealment,” she said, “alas! we have had
 too much already. and besides there is nothing in all the world that can
 give more pain than i have already endured--than i suffer now!
 whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!”
 helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly
 but quietly:--
 
“but dear madam mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for
 others from yourself, after what has happened?” her face grew set in its
 lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of martyr as she
 answered:--
 
“ah no! for my mind is made up!”
 
“to what?” asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in
 our own way we had sort of vague idea of what she meant. her answer
 came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating fact:--
 
“because if i find in myself--and i shall watch keenly for it--a sign of
 harm to any that i love, i shall die!”
 
“you would not kill yourself?” asked, hoarsely.
 
“i would; if there were friend who loved me, who would save such a
 pain, and so desperate an effort!” she looked at him meaningly as she
 spoke. was sitting down; but now rose and came close to her and
 put his hand on her head as said solemnly:
 
“my child, there is such an one if it were for your good. for myself i
 could hold it in my account with god to find such an euthanasia for you,
 even at this moment if it were best. nay, were it safe! but my
 child----” for moment seemed choked, and great sob rose in his
 throat; gulped it down and went on:--
 
“there are here some who would stand between you and death. you must not
 die. you must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. until
 the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not
 die; for if is still with the quick un-dead, your death would make
 you even as is. no, you must live! you must struggle and strive to
 live, though death would seem boon unspeakable. you must fight death
 himself, though come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the
 night; in safety or in peril! on your living soul i charge you that you
 do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.” the
 poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as i have seen a
 quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. we were all
 silent; we could do nothing. at length she grew more calm and turning to
 him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--
 
“i promise you, my dear friend, that if god will let live, i shall
 strive to do so; till, if it may be in his good time, this horror may
 have passed away from me.” she was so good and brave that we all felt
 that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we
 began to discuss what we were to do. i told her that she was to have all
 the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we
 might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.
 she was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if “pleased” could
 be used in connection with so grim an interest.
 
as usual helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was
 prepared with an exact ordering of our work.
 
“it is perhaps well,” said, “that at our meeting after our visit to
 carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay
 there. had we done so, the count must have guessed our purpose, and
 would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an
 effort with regard to the others; but now does not know our
 intentions. nay, more, in all probability, does not know that such a
 power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that cannot use
 them as of old. we are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as
 to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in
 piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. to-day, then, is ours;
 and in it rests our hope. the sun that rose on our sorrow this morning
 guards us in its course. until it sets to-night, that monster must
 retain whatever form now has. is confined within the limitations
 of his earthly envelope. cannot melt into thin air nor disappear
 through cracks or chinks or crannies. if go through doorway, he
 must open the door like mortal. and so we have this day to hunt out
 all his lairs and sterilise them. so we shall, if we have not yet catch
 him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching
 and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.” here i started up for i
 could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so
 preciously laden with mina’s life and happiness were flying from us,
 since whilst we talked action was impossible. but helsing held up
 his hand warningly. “nay, friend jonathan,” said, “in this, the
 quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. we shall all
 act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. but think, in
 all probable the key of the situation is in that house in piccadilly.
 the count may have many houses which has bought. of them will have
 deeds of purchase, keys and other things. will have paper that he
 write on; will have his book of cheques. there are many belongings
 that must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,
 where come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the
 very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. we shall go there and
 search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our
 friend arthur call, in his phrases of hunt ‘stop the earths’ and so we
 run down our old fox--so? is it not?”
 
“then let us come at once,” i cried, “we are wasting the precious,
 precious time!” the professor did not move, but simply said:--
 
“and how are we to get into that house in piccadilly?”
 
“any way!” i cried. “we shall break in if need be.”
 
“and your police; where will they be, and what will they say?”
 
i was staggered; but i knew that if wished to delay had good
 reason for it. so i said, as quietly as i could:--
 
“don’t wait more than need be; you know, i am sure, what torture i am
 in.”
 
“ah, my child, that i do; and indeed there is wish of to add to
 your anguish. but just think, what can we do, until all the world be at
 movement. then will come our time. i have thought and thought, and it
 seems to that the simplest way is the best of all. now we wish to get
 into the house, but we have key; is it not so?” i nodded.
 
“now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could
 not still get in; and think there was to you conscience of the
 housebreaker, what would you do?”
 
“i should get respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the
 lock for me.”
 
“and your police, they would interfere, would they not?”
 
“oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.”
 
“then,” looked at as keenly as spoke, “all that is in doubt is
 the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to
 whether or that employer has good conscience or bad one. your
 police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading
 the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. no, no, my
 friend jonathan, you go take the lock off hundred empty house in this
 your london, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such
 things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,
 one will interfere. i have read of gentleman who owned so fine
 house in london, and when went for months of summer to switzerland
 and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and
 got in. then went and made open the shutters in front and walk out
 and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. then he
 have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;
 and when the day come sell off by great auctioneer all the goods of
 that other man who own them. then go to builder, and sell him
 that house, making an agreement that pull it down and take all away
 within certain time. and your police and other authority help him all
 they can. and when that owner come back from his holiday in switzerland
 find only an empty hole where his house had been. this was all done
 _en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. we shall not go
 so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem
 it strange; but we shall go after ten o’clock, when there are many
 about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the
 house.”
 
i could not but see how right was and the terrible despair of mina’s
 face became relaxed thought; there was hope in such good counsel. van
 helsing went on:--
 
“when once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of
 us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be
 more earth-boxes--at bermondsey and mile end.”
 
lord godalming stood up. “i can be of some use here,” said. “i shall
 wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most
 convenient.”
 
“look here, old fellow,” said morris, “it is capital idea to have all
 ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don’t you think that one
 of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in byway of
 walworth or mile end would attract too much attention for our purposes?
 it seems to that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and
 even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.”
 
“friend quincey is right!” said the professor. “his head is what you
 call in plane with the horizon. it is difficult thing that we go to
 do, and we do not want peoples to watch us if so it may.”
 
mina took growing interest in everything and i was rejoiced to see
 that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for time the
 terrible experience of the night. she was very, very pale--almost
 ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in
 somewhat of prominence. i did not mention this last, lest it should give
 her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of
 what had occurred with poor lucy when the count had sucked her blood. as
 yet there was sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet
 was short, and there was time for fear.
 
when we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the
 disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. it was
 finally agreed that before starting for piccadilly we should destroy the
 count’s lair close at hand. in case should find it out too soon, we
 should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his
 presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us
 some new clue.
 
as to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the professor that,
 after our visit to carfax, we should all enter the house in piccadilly;
 that the two doctors and i should remain there, whilst lord godalming
 and quincey found the lairs at walworth and mile end and destroyed them.
 it was possible, if not likely, the professor urged, that the count
 might appear in piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be
 able to cope with him then and there. at any rate, we might be able to
 follow him in force. to this plan i strenuously objected, and so far as
 my going was concerned, for i said that i intended to stay and protect
 mina, i thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but mina would
 not listen to my objection. she said that there might be some law matter
 in which i could be useful; that amongst the count’s papers might be
 some clue which i could understand out of my experience in transylvania;
 and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to
 cope with the count’s extraordinary power. i had to give in, for mina’s
 resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that
 we should all work together. “as for me,” she said, “i have fear.
 things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must
 have in it some element of hope or comfort. go, my husband! god can, if
 wishes it, guard as well alone as with any one present.” so i
 started up crying out: “then in god’s name let us come at once, for we
 are losing time. the count may come to piccadilly earlier than we
 think.”
 
“not so!” said helsing, holding up his hand.
 
“but why?” i asked.
 
“do you forget,” said, with actually smile, “that last night he
 banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?”
 
did i forget! shall i ever--can i ever! can any of us ever forget that
 terrible scene! mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but
 the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and
 shuddered whilst she moaned. helsing had not intended to recall her
 frightful experience. had simply lost sight of her and her part in
 the affair in his intellectual effort. when it struck him what said,
 was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. “oh,
 madam mina,” said, “dear, dear madam mina, alas! that i of all who so
 reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. these stupid old
 lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will
 forget it, will you not?” bent low beside her as spoke; she took
 his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--
 
“no, i shall not forget, for it is well that i remember; and with it i
 have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that i take it all
 together. now, you must all be going soon. breakfast is ready, and we
 must all eat that we may be strong.”
 
breakfast was strange meal to us all. we tried to be cheerful and
 encourage each other, and mina was the brightest and most cheerful of
 us. when it was over, helsing stood up and said:--
 
“now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. are we
 all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy’s
 lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?” we all assured
 him. “then it is well. now, madam mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe
 here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- we shall
 return! but before we go let see you armed against personal attack. i
 have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing
 of things of which we know, so that may not enter. now let guard
 yourself. on your forehead i touch this piece of sacred wafer in the
 name of the father, the son, and----”
 
there was fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. as he
 had placed the wafer on mina’s forehead, it had seared it--had burned
 into the flesh as though it had been piece of white-hot metal. my poor
 darling’s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as
 her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that
 her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. but the
 words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased
 to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her
 knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. pulling her beautiful hair
 over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--
 
“unclean! unclean! even the almighty shuns my polluted flesh! i must
 bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the judgment day.” they
 all paused. i had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless
 grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. for few minutes our
 sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away
 their eyes that ran tears silently. then helsing turned and said
 gravely; so gravely that i could not help feeling that was in some
 way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--
 
“it may be that you may have to bear that mark till god himself see fit,
 as most surely shall, on the judgment day, to redress all wrongs of
 the earth and of his children that has placed thereon. and oh, madam
 mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that
 red scar, the sign of god’s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,
 and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. for so surely as
 we live, that scar shall pass away when god sees right to lift the
 burden that is hard upon us. till then we bear our cross, as his did
 in obedience to his will. it may be that we are chosen instruments of
 his good pleasure, and that we ascend to his bidding as that other
 through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and
 fears, and all that makes the difference between god and man.”
 
there was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.
 mina and i both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old
 man’s hands and bent over and kissed it. then without word we all
 knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each
 other. we men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the
 head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help
 and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.
 
it was then time to start. so i said farewell to mina, parting which
 neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.
 
to one thing i have made up my mind: if we find out that mina must be a
 vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible
 land alone. i suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant
 many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so
 the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.
 
we entered carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on
 the first occasion. it was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic
 surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such
 fear as already we knew. had not our minds been made up, and had there
 not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded
 with our task. we found papers, or any sign of use in the house; and
 in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.
 dr. helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--
 
“and now, my friends, we have duty here to do. we must sterilise this
 earth, so sacred of holy memories, that has brought from far
 distant land for such fell use. has chosen this earth because it has
 been holy. thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more
 holy still. it was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to
 god.” as spoke took from his bag screwdriver and wrench, and
 very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. the earth smelled
 musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention
 was concentrated on the professor. taking from his box piece of the
 sacred wafer laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down
 the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as worked.
 
one by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left
 them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was portion
 of the host.
 
when we closed the door behind us, the professor said solemnly:--
 
“so much is already done. if it may be that with all the others we can
 be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on madam
 mina’s forehead all white as ivory and with stain!”
 
as we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our
 train we could see the front of the asylum. i looked eagerly, and in the
 window of my own room saw mina. i waved my hand to her, and nodded to
 tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. she nodded in
 reply to show that she understood. the last i saw, she was waving her
 hand in farewell. it was with heavy heart that we sought the station
 and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the
 platform.
 
i have written this in the train.
 
* * * * *
 
_piccadilly, 12:30 o’clock._--just before we reached fenchurch street
 lord godalming said to me:--
 
“quincey and i will find locksmith. you had better not come with us in
 case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it
 wouldn’t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. but you are a
 solicitor and the incorporated law society might tell you that you
 should have known better.” i demurred as to my not sharing any danger
 even of odium, but went on: “besides, it will attract less attention
 if there are not too many of us. my title will make it all right with
 the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. you had
 better go with jack and the professor and stay in the green park,
 somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and
 the smith has gone away, do you all come across. we shall be on the
 lookout for you, and shall let you in.”
 
“the advice is good!” said helsing, so we said more. godalming
 and morris hurried off in cab, we following in another. at the corner
 of arlington street our contingent got out and strolled into the green
 park. my heart beat as i saw the house on which so much of our hope was
 centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst
 its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. we sat down on bench
 within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little
 attention as possible. the minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we
 waited for the coming of the others.
 
at length we saw four-wheeler drive up. out of it, in leisurely
 fashion, got lord godalming and morris; and down from the box descended
 thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. morris paid
 the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. together the two
 ascended the steps, and lord godalming pointed out what wanted done.
 the workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes
 of the rail, saying something to policeman who just then sauntered
 along. the policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down
 placed his bag beside him. after searching through it, took out a
 selection of tools which produced to lay beside him in orderly
 fashion. then stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and
 turning to his employers, made some remark. lord godalming smiled, and
 the man lifted good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he
 began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. after fumbling
 about for bit tried second, and then third. all at once the
 door opened under slight push from him, and and the two others
 entered the hall. we sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but van
 helsing’s went cold altogether. we waited patiently as we saw the
 workman come out and bring in his bag. then held the door partly
 open, steadying it with his knees, whilst fitted key to the lock.
 this finally handed to lord godalming, who took out his purse and
 gave him something. the man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his
 coat and departed; not soul took the slightest notice of the whole
 transaction.
 
when the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at
 the door. it was immediately opened by quincey morris, beside whom stood
 lord godalming lighting cigar.
 
“the place smells so vilely,” said the latter as we came in. it did
 indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at carfax--and with our
 previous experience it was plain to us that the count had been using the
 place pretty freely. we moved to explore the house, all keeping together
 in case of attack; for we knew we had strong and wily enemy to deal
 with, and as yet we did not know whether the count might not be in the
 house. in the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found
 eight boxes of earth. eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!
 our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the
 missing box. first we opened the shutters of the window which looked out
 across narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of stable,
 pointed to look like the front of miniature house. there were no
 windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. we did not
 lose any time in examining the chests. with the tools which we had
 brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had
 treated those others in the old chapel. it was evident to us that the
 count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for
 any of his effects.
 
after cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,
 we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects
 which might belong to the count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine
 them. they lay in sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room
 table. there were title deeds of the piccadilly house in great bundle;
 deeds of the purchase of the houses at mile end and bermondsey;
 note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. all were covered up in thin
 wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. there were also clothes
 brush, brush and comb, and jug and basin--the latter containing
 dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. last of all was a
 little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to
 the other houses. when we had examined this last find, lord godalming
 and quincey morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the
 houses in the east and the south, took with them the keys in great
 bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. the rest of us
 are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of
 the count.
 



chapter xxiii
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_3 october._--the time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for
 the coming of godalming and quincey morris. the professor tried to keep
 our minds active by using them all the time. i could see his beneficent
 purpose, by the side glances which threw from time to time at harker.
 the poor fellow is overwhelmed in misery that is appalling to see.
 last night was frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful
 face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. to-day is drawn,
 haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning
 eyes and grief-written lines of his face. his energy is still intact; in
 fact, is like living flame. this may yet be his salvation, for, if
 all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; will then,
 in kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. poor fellow, i
 thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! the professor knows
 this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. what he
 has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. so
 well as i can remember, here it is:--
 
“i have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all
 the papers relating to this monster; and the more i have studied, the
 greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. all through there
 are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of
 it. as i learned from the researches of my friend arminus of buda-pesth,
 was in life most wonderful man. soldier, statesman, and
 alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the
 science-knowledge of his time. had mighty brain, learning beyond
 compare, and heart that knew fear and remorse. dared even to
 attend the scholomance, and there was branch of knowledge of his time
 that did not essay. well, in him the brain powers survived the
 physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.
 in some faculties of mind has been, and is, only child; but is
 growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of
 man’s stature. is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not
 been that we have crossed his path would be yet--he may be yet if we
 fail--the father or furtherer of new order of beings, whose road must
 lead through death, not life.”
 
harker groaned and said, “and this is all arrayed against my darling!
 but how is experimenting? the knowledge may help us to defeat him!”
 
“he has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but
 surely; that big child-brain of his is working. well for us, it is, as
 yet, child-brain; for had dared, at the first, to attempt certain
 things would long ago have been beyond our power. however, means
 to succeed, and man who has centuries before him can afford to wait
 and to go slow. _festina lente_ may well be his motto.”
 
“i fail to understand,” said harker wearily. “oh, do be more plain to
 me! perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.”
 
the professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as spoke:--
 
“ah, my child, i will be plain. do you not see how, of late, this
 monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. how has been
 making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend
 john’s home; for your vampire, though in all afterwards can come when
 and how will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by
 an inmate. but these are not his most important experiments. do we not
 see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. he
 knew not then but that must be so. but all the time that so great
 child-brain of his was growing, and began to consider whether he
 might not himself move the box. so began to help; and then, when he
 found that this be all-right, try to move them all alone. and so he
 progress, and scatter these graves of him; and none but know where
 they are hidden. may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. so
 that only use them in the night, or at such time as can change his
 form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his
 hiding-place! but, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him
 just too late! already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;
 and before the sunset this shall be so. then have place where he
 can move and hide. i delayed this morning that so we might be sure. is
 there not more at stake for us than for him? then why we not be even
 more careful than him? by my clock it is one hour and already, if all be
 well, friend arthur and quincey are on their way to us. to-day is our
 day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose chance. see! there are
 five of us when those absent ones return.”
 
whilst was speaking we were startled by knock at the hall door, the
 double postman’s knock of the telegraph boy. we all moved out to the
 hall with one impulse, and helsing, holding up his hand to us to
 keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. the boy handed in a
 despatch. the professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the
 direction, opened it and read aloud.
 
“look out for d. has just now, 12:45, come from carfax hurriedly and
 hastened towards the south. seems to be going the round and may want
 to see you: mina.”
 
there was pause, broken by jonathan harker’s voice:--
 
“now, god be thanked, we shall soon meet!” helsing turned to him
 quickly and said:--
 
“god will act in his own way and time. do not fear, and do not rejoice
 as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.”
 
“i care for nothing now,” answered hotly, “except to wipe out this
 brute from the face of creation. i would sell my soul to do it!”
 
“oh, hush, hush, my child!” said helsing. “god does not purchase
 souls in this wise; and the devil, though may purchase, does not keep
 faith. but god is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your
 devotion to that dear madam mina. think you, how her pain would be
 doubled, did she but hear your wild words. do not fear any of us, we are
 all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. the time is
 coming for action; to-day this vampire is limit to the powers of man,
 and till sunset may not change. it will take him time to arrive
 here--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times
 before can hither come, be never so quick. what we must hope for
 is that my lord arthur and quincey arrive first.”
 
about half an hour after we had received mrs. harker’s telegram, there
 came quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. it was just an ordinary
 knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made
 the professor’s heart and mine beat loudly. we looked at each other, and
 together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various
 armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. van
 helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood
 back, having both hands ready for action. the gladness of our hearts
 must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we
 saw lord godalming and quincey morris. they came quickly in and closed
 the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the
 hall:--
 
“it is all right. we found both places; six boxes in each and we
 destroyed them all!”
 
“destroyed?” asked the professor.
 
“for him!” we were silent for minute, and then quincey said:--
 
“there’s nothing to do but to wait here. if, however, doesn’t turn up
 by five o’clock, we must start off; for it won’t do to leave mrs. harker
 alone after sunset.”
 
“he will be here before long now,” said helsing, who had been
 consulting his pocket-book. “_nota bene_, in madam’s telegram went
 south from carfax, that means went to cross the river, and could
 only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one
 o’clock. that went south has meaning for us. is as yet only
 suspicious; and went from carfax first to the place where would
 suspect interference least. you must have been at bermondsey only a
 short time before him. that is not here already shows that went to
 mile end next. this took him some time; for would then have to be
 carried over the river in some way. believe me, my friends, we shall not
 have long to wait now. we should have ready some plan of attack, so that
 we may throw away chance. hush, there is time now. have all your
 arms! be ready!” held up warning hand as spoke, for we all could
 hear key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.
 
i could not but admire, even at such moment, the way in which a
 dominant spirit asserted itself. in all our hunting parties and
 adventures in different parts of the world, quincey morris had always
 been the one to arrange the plan of action, and arthur and i had been
 accustomed to obey him implicitly. now, the old habit seemed to be
 renewed instinctively. with swift glance around the room, at once
 laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking word, with a
 gesture, placed us each in position. helsing, harker, and i were
 just behind the door, so that when it was opened the professor could
 guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.
 godalming behind and quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to
 move in front of the window. we waited in suspense that made the
 seconds pass with nightmare slowness. the slow, careful steps came along
 the hall; the count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least
 feared it.
 
suddenly with single bound leaped into the room, winning way past
 us before any of us could raise hand to stay him. there was something
 so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed
 to sober us all from the shock of his coming. the first to act was
 harker, who, with quick movement, threw himself before the door
 leading into the room in the front of the house. as the count saw us, a
 horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long
 and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into cold stare of
 lion-like disdain. his expression again changed as, with single
 impulse, we all advanced upon him. it was pity that we had not some
 better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment i wondered what
 we were to do. i did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would
 avail us anything. harker evidently meant to try the matter, for had
 ready his great kukri knife and made fierce and sudden cut at him. the
 blow was powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the count’s
 leap back saved him. second less and the trenchant blade had shorne
 through his heart. as it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,
 making wide gap whence bundle of bank-notes and stream of gold
 fell out. the expression of the count’s face was so hellish, that for a
 moment i feared for harker, though i saw him throw the terrible knife
 aloft again for another stroke. instinctively i moved forward with a
 protective impulse, holding the crucifix and wafer in my left hand. i
 felt mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that i
 saw the monster cower back before similar movement made spontaneously
 by each one of us. it would be impossible to describe the expression of
 hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over
 the count’s face. his waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast
 of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the
 pallid skin like palpitating wound. the next instant, with sinuous
 dive swept under harker’s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping
 handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw
 himself at the window. amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,
 tumbled into the flagged area below. through the sound of the
 shivering glass i could hear the “ting” of the gold, as some of the
 sovereigns fell on the flagging.
 
we ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. he, rushing up
 the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.
 there turned and spoke to us:--
 
“you think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in row, like
 sheep in butcher’s. you shall be sorry yet, each one of you! you think
 you have left without place to rest; but i have more. my revenge is
 just begun! i spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. your
 girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and
 others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my
 jackals when i want to feed. bah!” with contemptuous sneer, passed
 quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he
 fastened it behind him. door beyond opened and shut. the first of us
 to speak was the professor, as, realising the difficulty of following
 him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.
 
“we have learnt something--much! notwithstanding his brave words, he
 fears us; fear time, fear want! for if not, why hurry so? his
 very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. why take that money? you
 follow quick. you are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. for
 me, i make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he
 return.” as spoke put the money remaining into his pocket; took
 the title-deeds in the bundle as harker had left them, and swept the
 remaining things into the open fireplace, where set fire to them with
 match.
 
godalming and morris had rushed out into the yard, and harker had
 lowered himself from the window to follow the count. had, however,
 bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there
 was sign of him. helsing and i tried to make inquiry at the back
 of the house; but the mews was deserted and one had seen him depart.
 
it was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. we had to
 recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the
 professor when said:--
 
“let us go back to madam mina--poor, poor dear madam mina. all we can do
 just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. but we need
 not despair. there is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find
 it; when that is done all may yet be well.” i could see that spoke as
 bravely as could to comfort harker. the poor fellow was quite broken
 down; now and again gave low groan which could not suppress--he
 was thinking of his wife.
 
with sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found mrs. harker
 waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her
 bravery and unselfishness. when she saw our faces, her own became as
 pale as death: for second or two her eyes were closed as if she were
 in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--
 
“i can never thank you all enough. oh, my poor darling!” as she spoke,
 she took her husband’s grey head in her hands and kissed it--“lay your
 poor head here and rest it. all will yet be well, dear! god will protect
 us if so will it in his good intent.” the poor fellow groaned. there
 was place for words in his sublime misery.
 
we had sort of perfunctory supper together, and i think it cheered us
 all up somewhat. it was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry
 people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense
 of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less
 miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. true to
 our promise, we told mrs. harker everything which had passed; and
 although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to
 threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was
 manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. when we came to the
 part where harker had rushed at the count so recklessly, she clung to
 her husband’s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could
 protect him from any harm that might come. she said nothing, however,
 till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up
 to the present time. then without letting go her husband’s hand she
 stood up amongst us and spoke. oh, that i could give any idea of the
 scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty
 of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which
 she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our
 teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against
 our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and
 we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and
 purity and faith, was outcast from god.
 
“jonathan,” she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was
 so full of love and tenderness, “jonathan dear, and you all my true,
 true friends, i want you to bear something in mind through all this
 dreadful time. i know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as
 you destroyed the false lucy so that the true lucy might live hereafter;
 but it is not work of hate. that poor soul who has wrought all this
 misery is the saddest case of all. just think what will be his joy when
 he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have
 spiritual immortality. you must be pitiful to him, too, though it may
 not hold your hands from his destruction.”
 
as she spoke i could see her husband’s face darken and draw together, as
 though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.
 instinctively the clasp on his wife’s hand grew closer, till his
 knuckles looked white. she did not flinch from the pain which i knew she
 must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing
 than ever. as she stopped speaking leaped to his feet, almost tearing
 his hand from hers as spoke:--
 
“may god give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that
 earthly life of him which we are aiming at. if beyond it i could send
 his soul for ever and ever to burning hell i would do it!”
 
“oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good god. don’t say such things,
 jonathan, my husband; or you will crush with fear and horror. just
 think, my dear--i have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that
 ... perhaps ... some day ... i, too, may need such pity; and that some
 other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! oh,
 my husband! my husband, indeed i would have spared you such thought
 had there been another way; but i pray that god may not have treasured
 your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of very loving and
 sorely stricken man. oh, god, let these poor white hairs go in evidence
 of what has suffered, who all his life has done wrong, and on whom
 so many sorrows have come.”
 
we men were all in tears now. there was resisting them, and we wept
 openly. she wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.
 her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms
 round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. helsing beckoned
 to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone
 with their god.
 
before they retired the professor fixed up the room against any coming
 of the vampire, and assured mrs. harker that she might rest in peace.
 she tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her
 husband’s sake, tried to seem content. it was brave struggle; and was,
 i think and believe, not without its reward. helsing had placed at
 hand bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.
 when they had retired, quincey, godalming, and i arranged that we should
 sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the
 poor stricken lady. the first watch falls to quincey, so the rest of us
 shall be off to bed as soon as we can. godalming has already turned in,
 for his is the second watch. now that my work is done i, too, shall go
 to bed.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_3-4 october, close to midnight._--i thought yesterday would never end.
 there was over yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief
 that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must
 now be for the better. before we parted, we discussed what our next step
 was to be, but we could arrive at result. all we knew was that one
 earth-box remained, and that the count alone knew where it was. if he
 chooses to lie hidden, may baffle us for years; and in the
 meantime!--the thought is too horrible, i dare not think of it even now.
 this i know: that if ever there was woman who was all perfection, that
 one is my poor wronged darling. i love her thousand times more for her
 sweet pity of last night, pity that made my own hate of the monster
 seem despicable. surely god will not permit the world to be the poorer
 by the loss of such creature. this is hope to me. we are all drifting
 reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. thank god! mina is
 sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. i fear what her dreams might be
 like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. she has not been so
 calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. then, for while, there came
 over her face repose which was like spring after the blasts of march.
 i thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her
 face, but somehow now i think it has deeper meaning. i am not sleepy
 myself, though i am weary--weary to death. however, i must try to sleep;
 for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is rest for me
 until....
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--i must have fallen asleep, for i was awaked by mina, who was
 sitting up in bed, with startled look on her face. i could see easily,
 for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed warning hand
 over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--
 
“hush! there is someone in the corridor!” i got up softly, and crossing
 the room, gently opened the door.
 
just outside, stretched on mattress, lay mr. morris, wide awake. he
 raised warning hand for silence as whispered to me:--
 
“hush! go back to bed; it is all right. one of us will be here all
 night. we don’t mean to take any chances!”
 
his look and gesture forbade discussion, so i came back and told mina.
 she sighed and positively shadow of smile stole over her poor, pale
 face as she put her arms round and said softly:--
 
“oh, thank god for good brave men!” with sigh she sank back again to
 sleep. i write this now as i am not sleepy, though i must try again.
 
* * * * *
 
_4 october, morning._--once again during the night i was wakened by
 mina. this time we had all had good sleep, for the grey of the coming
 dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was
 like speck rather than disc of light. she said to hurriedly:--
 
“go, call the professor. i want to see him at once.”
 
“why?” i asked.
 
“i have an idea. i suppose it must have come in the night, and matured
 without my knowing it. must hypnotise before the dawn, and then i
 shall be able to speak. go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.” i
 went to the door. dr. seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing
 me, sprang to his feet.
 
“is anything wrong?” asked, in alarm.
 
“no,” i replied; “but mina wants to see dr. helsing at once.”
 
“i will go,” said, and hurried into the professor’s room.
 
in two or three minutes later helsing was in the room in his
 dressing-gown, and mr. morris and lord godalming were with dr. seward at
 the door asking questions. when the professor saw mina smile--a
 positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; rubbed his hands as he
 said:--
 
“oh, my dear madam mina, this is indeed change. see! friend jonathan,
 we have got our dear madam mina, as of old, back to us to-day!” then
 turning to her, said, cheerfully: “and what am i do for you? for at
 this hour you do not want for nothings.”
 
“i want you to hypnotise me!” she said. “do it before the dawn, for i
 feel that then i can speak, and speak freely. be quick, for the time is
 short!” without word motioned her to sit up in bed.
 
looking fixedly at her, commenced to make passes in front of her,
 from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. mina
 gazed at him fixedly for few minutes, during which my own heart beat
 like trip hammer, for i felt that some crisis was at hand. gradually
 her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of
 her bosom could one know that she was alive. the professor made few
 more passes and then stopped, and i could see that his forehead was
 covered with great beads of perspiration. mina opened her eyes; but she
 did not seem the same woman. there was far-away look in her eyes, and
 her voice had sad dreaminess which was new to me. raising his hand to
 impose silence, the professor motioned to to bring the others in.
 they came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the
 foot of the bed, looking on. mina appeared not to see them. the
 stillness was broken by helsing’s voice speaking in low level tone
 which would not break the current of her thoughts:--
 
“where are you?” the answer came in neutral way:--
 
“i do not know. sleep has place it can call its own.” for several
 minutes there was silence. mina sat rigid, and the professor stood
 staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. the room
 was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from mina’s face, dr. van
 helsing motioned to pull up the blind. i did so, and the day seemed
 just upon us. red streak shot up, and rosy light seemed to diffuse
 itself through the room. on the instant the professor spoke again:--
 
“where are you now?” the answer came dreamily, but with intention; it
 were as though she were interpreting something. i have heard her use the
 same tone when reading her shorthand notes.
 
“i do not know. it is all strange to me!”
 
“what do you see?”
 
“i can see nothing; it is all dark.”
 
“what do you hear?” i could detect the strain in the professor’s patient
 voice.
 
“the lapping of water. it is gurgling by, and little waves leap. i can
 hear them on the outside.”
 
“then you are on ship?” we all looked at each other, trying to glean
 something each from the other. we were afraid to think. the answer came
 quick:--
 
“oh, yes!”
 
“what else do you hear?”
 
“the sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. there is the
 creaking of chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan
 falls into the rachet.”
 
“what are you doing?”
 
“i am still--oh, so still. it is like death!” the voice faded away into
 deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.
 
by this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of
 day. dr. helsing placed his hands on mina’s shoulders, and laid her
 head down softly on her pillow. she lay like sleeping child for few
 moments, and then, with long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see
 us all around her. “have i been talking in my sleep?” was all she said.
 she seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she
 was eager to know what she had told. the professor repeated the
 conversation, and she said:--
 
“then there is not moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!” mr.
 morris and lord godalming started for the door but the professor’s calm
 voice called them back:--
 
“stay, my friends. that ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor
 whilst she spoke. there are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in
 your so great port of london. which of them is it that you seek? god be
 thanked that we have once again clue, though whither it may lead us we
 know not. we have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,
 since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking
 forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! alas, but
 that sentence is puddle; is it not? we can know now what was in the
 count’s mind, when seize that money, though jonathan’s so fierce
 knife put him in the danger that even dread. meant escape. hear
 me, escape! saw that with but one earth-box left, and pack of men
 following like dogs after fox, this london was place for him. he
 have take his last earth-box on board ship, and leave the land. he
 think to escape, but no! we follow him. tally ho! as friend arthur would
 say when put on his red frock! our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and
 we must follow with wile. i, too, am wily and i think his mind in a
 little while. in meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters
 between us which do not want to pass, and which could not if he
 would--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or
 slack tide. see, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to
 us. let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,
 and which we can eat comfortably since be not in the same land with
 us.” mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--
 
“but why need we seek him further, when is gone away from us?” he
 took her hand and patted it as replied:--
 
“ask nothings as yet. when we have breakfast, then i answer all
 questions.” would say more, and we separated to dress.
 
after breakfast mina repeated her question. looked at her gravely for
 minute and then said sorrowfully:--
 
“because my dear, dear madam mina, now more than ever must we find him
 even if we have to follow him to the jaws of hell!” she grew paler as
 she asked faintly:--
 
“why?”
 
“because,” answered solemnly, “he can live for centuries, and you are
 but mortal woman. time is now to be dreaded--since once put that mark
 upon your throat.”
 
i was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in faint.
 



chapter xxiv
 
dr. seward’s phonograph diary, spoken by helsing
 

this to jonathan harker.
 
you are to stay with your dear madam mina. we shall go to make our
 search--if i can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we
 seek confirmation only. but do you stay and take care of her to-day.
 this is your best and most holiest office. this day nothing can find him
 here. let tell you that so you will know what we four know already,
 for i have tell them. he, our enemy, have gone away; have gone back
 to his castle in transylvania. i know it so well, as if great hand of
 fire wrote it on the wall. have prepare for this in some way, and
 that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. for this took the
 money; for this hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun
 go down. it was his last hope, save that might hide in the tomb that
 think poor miss lucy, being as thought like him, keep open to him.
 but there was not of time. when that fail make straight for his last
 resource--his last earth-work i might say did i wish _double entente_.
 is clever, oh, so clever! know that his game here was finish; and
 so decide go back home. find ship going by the route came,
 and go in it. we go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;
 when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. then we will
 comfort you and poor dear madam mina with new hope. for it will be hope
 when you think it over: that all is not lost. this very creature that we
 pursue, take hundreds of years to get so far as london; and yet in
 one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. is
 finite, though is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.
 but we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong
 together. take heart afresh, dear husband of madam mina. this battle is
 but begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that god sits on high
 to watch over his children. therefore be of much comfort till we return.
 
helsing.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_4 october._--when i read to mina, helsing’s message in the
 phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. already the
 certainty that the count is out of the country has given her comfort;
 and comfort is strength to her. for my own part, now that his horrible
 danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to
 believe in it. even my own terrible experiences in castle dracula seem
 like long-forgotten dream. here in the crisp autumn air in the bright
 sunlight----
 
alas! how can i disbelieve! in the midst of my thought my eye fell on
 the red scar on my poor darling’s white forehead. whilst that lasts,
 there can be disbelief. and afterwards the very memory of it will
 keep faith crystal clear. mina and i fear to be idle, so we have been
 over all the diaries again and again. somehow, although the reality
 seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. there is
 something of guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.
 mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. it may
 be! i shall try to think as she does. we have never spoken to each other
 yet of the future. it is better to wait till we see the professor and
 the others after their investigations.
 
the day is running by more quickly than i ever thought day could run
 for again. it is now three o’clock.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_5 october, 5 p. m._--our meeting for report. present: professor van
 helsing, lord godalming, dr. seward, mr. quincey morris, jonathan
 harker, mina harker.
 
dr. helsing described what steps were taken during the day to
 discover on what boat and whither bound count dracula made his escape:--
 
“as i knew that wanted to get back to transylvania, i felt sure that
 must go by the danube mouth; or by somewhere in the black sea, since
 by that way come. it was dreary blank that was before us. _omne
 ignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what
 ships leave for the black last night. was in sailing ship, since
 madam mina tell of sails being set. these not so important as to go in
 your list of the shipping in the _times_, and so we go, by suggestion of
 lord godalming, to your lloyd’s, where are note of all ships that sail,
 however so small. there we find that only one black-sea-bound ship go
 out with the tide. she is the _czarina catherine_, and she sail from
 doolittle’s wharf for varna, and thence on to other parts and up the
 danube. ‘soh!’ said i, ‘this is the ship whereon is the count.’ so off
 we go to doolittle’s wharf, and there we find man in an office of wood
 so small that the man look bigger than the office. from him we inquire
 of the goings of the _czarina catherine_. swear much, and red face
 and loud of voice, but good fellow all the same; and when quincey
 give him something from his pocket which crackle as roll it up, and
 put it in so small bag which have hid deep in his clothing, he
 still better fellow and humble servant to us. come with us, and ask
 many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they
 have been more thirsty. they say much of blood and bloom, and of
 others which i comprehend not, though i guess what they mean; but
 nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.
 
“they make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five
 o’clock comes man so hurry. tall man, thin and pale, with high nose
 and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. that be all in
 black, except that have hat of straw which suit not him or the
 time. that scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship
 sails for the black and for where. some took him to the office and
 then to the ship, where will not go aboard but halt at shore end of
 gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. the captain come, when
 told that will be pay well; and though swear much at the first he
 agree to term. then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse
 and cart can be hired. go there and soon come again, himself
 driving cart on which great box; this himself lift down, though it
 take several to put it on truck for the ship. give much talk to
 captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like
 it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if like he
 can come and see where it shall be. but say ‘no’; that come not
 yet, for that have much to do. whereupon the captain tell him that he
 had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the
 place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. then the thin
 man smile and say that of course must go when think fit; but he
 will be surprise if go quite so soon. the captain swear again,
 polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he
 will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the
 sailing. final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell
 him that doesn’t want frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also
 with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. and so, after asking
 where there might be close at hand ship where might purchase ship
 forms, departed.
 
“no one knew where went ‘or bloomin’ well cared,’ as they said, for
 they had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon
 became apparent to all that the _czarina catherine_ would not sail as
 was expected. thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,
 and grew; till soon dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.
 the captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and
 blood; but could do nothing. the water rose and rose; and began to
 fear that would lose the tide altogether. was in friendly mood,
 when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and
 asked to see where his box had been stowed. then the captain replied
 that wished that and his box--old and with much bloom and
 blood--were in hell. but the thin man did not be offend, and went down
 with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile
 on deck in fog. must have come off by himself, for none notice him.
 indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and
 all was clear again. my friends of the thirst and the language that was
 of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain’s swears
 exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of
 picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up
 and down on the river that hour, found that few of them had seen any
 of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. however, the ship
 went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the
 river mouth. she was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.
 
“and so, my dear madam mina, it is that we have to rest for time, for
 our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the
 danube mouth. to sail ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when
 we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. our best hope
 is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then
 can make struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. there
 are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. we know all about
 where go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us
 invoices and all papers that can be. the box we seek is to be landed in
 varna, and to be given to an agent, one ristics who will there present
 his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.
 when ask if there be any wrong, for that so, can telegraph and
 have inquiry made at varna, we say ‘no’; for what is to be done is not
 for police or of the customs. it must be done by us alone and in our own
 way.”
 
when dr. helsing had done speaking, i asked him if were certain
 that the count had remained on board the ship. replied: “we have the
 best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this
 morning.” i asked him again if it were really necessary that they should
 pursue the count, for oh! i dread jonathan leaving me, and i know that
 would surely go if the others went. answered in growing passion,
 at first quietly. as went on, however, grew more angry and more
 forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some
 of that personal dominance which made him so long master amongst
 men:--
 
“yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! for your sake in the first,
 and then for the sake of humanity. this monster has done much harm
 already, in the narrow scope where find himself, and in the short
 time when as yet was only as body groping his so small measure in
 darkness and not knowing. all this have i told these others; you, my
 dear madam mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend john, or
 in that of your husband. i have told them how the measure of leaving his
 own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to new land where life
 of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the
 work of centuries. were another of the un-dead, like him, to try to do
 what has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have
 been, or that will be, could aid him. with this one, all the forces of
 nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in
 some wondrous way. the very place, where have been alive, un-dead for
 all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical
 world. there are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.
 there have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters
 of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. doubtless,
 there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of
 occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in
 himself were from the first some great qualities. in hard and warlike
 time was celebrate that have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,
 more braver heart, than any man. in him some vital principle have in
 strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and
 thrive, so his brain grow too. all this without that diabolic aid which
 is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,
 and are, symbolic of good. and now this is what is to us. have
 infect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that i must say such; but it is for
 good of you that i speak. infect you in such wise, that even if do
 more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and
 so in time, death, which is of man’s common lot and with god’s sanction,
 shall make you like to him. this must not be! we have sworn together
 that it must not. thus are we ministers of god’s own wish: that the
 world, and men for whom his die, will not be given over to monsters,
 whose very existence would defame him. have allowed us to redeem one
 soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the cross to redeem
 more. like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if
 we fall, we fall in good cause.” paused and i said:--
 
“but will not the count take his rebuff wisely? since has been driven
 from england, will not avoid it, as tiger does the village from
 which has been hunted?”
 
“aha!” said, “your simile of the tiger good, for me, and i shall
 adopt him. your man-eater, as they of india call the tiger who has once
 tasted blood of the human, care more for the other prey, but prowl
 unceasing till get him. this that we hunt from our village is a
 tiger, too, man-eater, and never cease to prowl. nay, in himself he
 is not one to retire and stay afar. in his life, his living life, go
 over the turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; be
 beaten back, but did stay? no! come again, and again, and again.
 look at his persistence and endurance. with the child-brain that was to
 him have long since conceive the idea of coming to great city. what
 does do? find out the place of all the world most of promise for
 him. then deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. he
 find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. he
 study new tongues. learn new social life; new environment of old
 ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of new
 land and new people who have come to be since was. his glimpse that
 have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. nay, it help
 him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right was at
 the first in his surmises. have done this alone; all alone! from a
 ruin tomb in forgotten land. what more may not do when the greater
 world of thought is open to him. that can smile at death, as we know
 him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole
 peoples. oh, if such an one was to come from god, and not the devil,
 what force for good might not be in this old world of ours. but we
 are pledged to set the world free. our toil must be in silence, and our
 efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not
 even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest
 strength. it would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons
 to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls
 for the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the
 honour and glory of god.”
 
after general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing
 be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to
 think out the proper conclusions. to-morrow, at breakfast, we are to
 meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we
 shall decide on some definite cause of action.
 
* * * * *
 
i feel wonderful peace and rest to-night. it is as if some haunting
 presence were removed from me. perhaps ...
 
my surmise was not finished, could not be; for i caught sight in the
 mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and i knew that i was still
 unclean.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_5 october._--we all rose early, and i think that sleep did much for
 each and all of us. when we met at early breakfast there was more
 general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience
 again.
 
it is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. let
 any obstructing cause, matter what, be removed in any way--even by
 death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. more
 than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether
 the whole of the past days had not been dream. it was only when i
 caught sight of the red blotch on mrs. harker’s forehead that i was
 brought back to reality. even now, when i am gravely revolving the
 matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our
 trouble is still existent. even mrs. harker seems to lose sight of her
 trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something
 recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. we are to
 meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of
 action. i see only one immediate difficulty, i know it by instinct
 rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet i fear
 that in some mysterious way poor mrs. harker’s tongue is tied. i _know_
 that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been i can
 guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or
 cannot, give them utterance. i have mentioned this to helsing, and
 and i are to talk it over when we are alone. i suppose it is some of
 that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. the
 count had his own purposes when gave her what helsing called “the
 vampire’s baptism of blood.” well, there may be poison that distils
 itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is
 mystery we should not wonder at anything! one thing i know: that if my
 instinct be true regarding poor mrs. harker’s silences, then there is a
 terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. the same
 power that compels her silence may compel her speech. i dare not think
 further; for so i should in my thoughts dishonour noble woman!
 
helsing is coming to my study little before the others. i shall
 try to open the subject with him.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--when the professor came in, we talked over the state of
 things. i could see that had something on his mind which wanted to
 say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. after beating
 about the bush little, said suddenly:--
 
“friend john, there is something that you and i must talk of alone, just
 at the first at any rate. later, we may have to take the others into our
 confidence”; then stopped, so i waited; went on:--
 
“madam mina, our poor, dear madam mina is changing.” cold shiver ran
 through to find my worst fears thus endorsed. helsing
 continued:--
 
“with the sad experience of miss lucy, we must this time be warned
 before things go too far. our task is now in reality more difficult than
 ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. i
 can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. it is now
 but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice
 without to prejudge. her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes
 are more hard. but these are not all, there is to her the silence now
 often; as so it was with miss lucy. she did not speak, even when she
 wrote that which she wished to be known later. now my fear is this. if
 it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the count see and
 hear, is it not more true that who have hypnotise her first, and who
 have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he
 will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?” i nodded
 acquiescence; went on:--
 
“then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of
 our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. this is painful
 task! oh, so painful that it heart-break to think of; but it must be.
 when to-day we meet, i must tell her that for reason which we will not
 to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by
 us.” wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration
 at the thought of the pain which might have to inflict upon the poor
 soul already so tortured. i knew that it would be some sort of comfort
 to him if i told him that i also had come to the same conclusion; for at
 any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. i told him, and the
 effect was as i expected.
 
it is now close to the time of our general gathering. helsing has
 gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. i
 really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--at the very outset of our meeting great personal relief was
 experienced by both helsing and myself. mrs. harker had sent a
 message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as
 she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements
 without her presence to embarrass us. the professor and i looked at each
 other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. for my own
 part, i thought that if mrs. harker realised the danger herself, it was
 much pain as well as much danger averted. under the circumstances we
 agreed, by questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to
 preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to
 confer alone again. we went at once into our plan of campaign. van
 helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--
 
“the _czarina catherine_ left the thames yesterday morning. it will take
 her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to
 reach varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.
 now, if we allow for two days less for the ship’s voyage, owing to such
 weather influences as we know that the count can bring to bear; and if
 we allow whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,
 then we have margin of nearly two weeks. thus, in order to be quite
 safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. then we shall at any rate
 be in varna day before the ship arrives, and able to make such
 preparations as may be necessary. of course we shall all go armed--armed
 against evil things, spiritual as well as physical.” here quincey morris
 added:--
 
“i understand that the count comes from wolf country, and it may be
 that shall get there before us. i propose that we add winchesters to
 our armament. i have kind of belief in winchester when there is any
 trouble of that sort around. do you remember, art, when we had the pack
 after us at tobolsk? what wouldn’t we have given then for repeater
 apiece!”
 
“good!” said helsing, “winchesters it shall be. quincey’s head is
 level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more
 dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. in the meantime we
 can do nothing here; and as i think that varna is not familiar to any of
 us, why not go there more soon? it is as long to wait here as there.
 to-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we
 four can set out on our journey.”
 
“we four?” said harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of
 us.
 
“of course!” answered the professor quickly, “you must remain to take
 care of your so sweet wife!” harker was silent for awhile and then said
 in hollow voice:--
 
“let us talk of that part of it in the morning. i want to consult with
 mina.” i thought that now was the time for helsing to warn him not
 to disclose our plans to her; but took notice. i looked at him
 significantly and coughed. for answer put his finger on his lips and
 turned away.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_5 october, afternoon._--for some time after our meeting this morning i
 could not think. the new phases of things leave my mind in state of
 wonder which allows room for active thought. mina’s determination not
 to take any part in the discussion set thinking; and as i could not
 argue the matter with her, i could only guess. i am as far as ever from
 solution now. the way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the
 last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no
 more concealment of anything amongst us. mina is sleeping now, calmly
 and sweetly like little child. her lips are curved and her face beams
 with happiness. thank god, there are such moments still for her.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--how strange it all is. i sat watching mina’s happy sleep, and
 came as near to being happy myself as i suppose i shall ever be. as the
 evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking
 lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. all at
 once mina opened her eyes, and looking at tenderly, said:--
 
“jonathan, i want you to promise something on your word of honour. a
 promise made to me, but made holily in god’s hearing, and not to be
 broken though i should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter
 tears. quick, you must make it to at once.”
 
“mina,” i said, “a promise like that, i cannot make at once. i may have
 right to make it.”
 
“but, dear one,” she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes
 were like pole stars, “it is i who wish it; and it is not for myself.
 you can ask dr. helsing if i am not right; if disagrees you may
 do as you will. nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved
 from the promise.”
 
“i promise!” i said, and for moment she looked supremely happy; though
 to all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.
 she said:--
 
“promise that you will not tell anything of the plans formed for
 the campaign against the count. not by word, or inference, or
 implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!” and she
 solemnly pointed to the scar. i saw that she was in earnest, and said
 solemnly:--
 
“i promise!” and as i said it i felt that from that instant door had
 been shut between us.
 
* * * * *
 
_later, midnight._--mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.
 so much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected
 somewhat with her gaiety; as result even i myself felt as if the pall
 of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. we all retired
 early. mina is now sleeping like little child; it is wonderful thing
 that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible
 trouble. thank god for it, for then at least she can forget her care.
 perhaps her example may affect as her gaiety did to-night. i shall
 try it. oh! for dreamless sleep.
 
* * * * *
 
_6 october, morning._--another surprise. mina woke early, about the
 same time as yesterday, and asked to bring dr. helsing. i thought
 that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went
 for the professor. had evidently expected some such call, for i found
 him dressed in his room. his door was ajar, so that could hear the
 opening of the door of our room. came at once; as passed into the
 room, asked mina if the others might come, too.
 
“no,” she said quite simply, “it will not be necessary. you can tell
 them just as well. i must go with you on your journey.”
 
dr. helsing was as startled as i was. after moment’s pause he
 asked:--
 
“but why?”
 
“you must take with you. i am safer with you, and you shall be safer,
 too.”
 
“but why, dear madam mina? you know that your safety is our solemnest
 duty. we go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than
 any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been.” paused,
 embarrassed.
 
as she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--
 
“i know. that is why i must go. i can tell you now, whilst the sun is
 coming up; i may not be able again. i know that when the count wills me
 i must go. i know that if tells to come in secret, i must come by
 wile; by any device to hoodwink--even jonathan.” god saw the look that
 she turned on as she spoke, and if there be indeed recording angel
 that look is noted to her everlasting honour. i could only clasp her
 hand. i could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of
 tears. she went on:--
 
“you men are brave and strong. you are strong in your numbers, for you
 can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had
 to guard alone. besides, i may be of service, since you can hypnotise me
 and so learn that which even i myself do not know.” dr. helsing said
 very gravely:--
 
“madam mina, you are, as always, most wise. you shall with us come; and
 together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.” when had
 spoken, mina’s long spell of silence made look at her. she had fallen
 back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when i had pulled up
 the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. helsing
 motioned to to come with him quietly. we went to his room, and within
 minute lord godalming, dr. seward, and mr. morris were with us also.
 told them what mina had said, and went on:--
 
“in the morning we shall leave for varna. we have now to deal with a
 new factor: madam mina. oh, but her soul is true. it is to her an agony
 to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are
 warned in time. there must be chance lost, and in varna we must be
 ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.”
 
“what shall we do exactly?” asked mr. morris laconically. the professor
 paused before replying:--
 
“we shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified
 the box, we shall place branch of the wild rose on it. this we shall
 fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the
 superstition. and to superstition must we trust at the first; it was
 man’s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. then,
 when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we
 shall open the box, and--and all will be well.”
 
“i shall not wait for any opportunity,” said morris. “when i see the box
 i shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were thousand
 men looking on, and if i am to be wiped out for it the next moment!” i
 grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as piece of steel.
 i think understood my look; i hope did.
 
“good boy,” said dr. helsing. “brave boy. quincey is all man. god
 bless him for it. my child, believe none of us shall lag behind or
 pause from any fear. i do but say what we may do--what we must do. but,
 indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. there are so many things
 which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that
 until the moment we may not say. we shall all be armed, in all ways; and
 when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. now
 let us to-day put all our affairs in order. let all things which touch
 on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us
 can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. as for me, my own
 affairs are regulate; and as i have nothing else to do, i shall go make
 arrangements for the travel. i shall have all tickets and so forth for
 our journey.”
 
there was nothing further to be said, and we parted. i shall now settle
 up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--it is all done; my will is made, and all complete. mina if she
 survive is my sole heir. if it should not be so, then the others who
 have been so good to us shall have remainder.
 
it is now drawing towards the sunset; mina’s uneasiness calls my
 attention to it. i am sure that there is something on her mind which the
 time of exact sunset will reveal. these occasions are becoming harrowing
 times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new
 danger--some new pain, which, however, may in god’s will be means to a
 good end. i write all these things in the diary since my darling must
 not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they
 shall be ready.
 
she is calling to me.
 



chapter xxv
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_11 october, evening._--jonathan harker has asked to note this, as he
 says is hardly equal to the task, and wants an exact record kept.
 
i think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see mrs.
 harker little before the time of sunset. we have of late come to
 understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;
 when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing
 or restraining her, or inciting her to action. this mood or condition
 begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts
 till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with
 the rays streaming above the horizon. at first there is sort of
 negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute
 freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the
 change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by spell of
 warning silence.
 
to-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the
 signs of an internal struggle. i put it down myself to her making a
 violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. very few
 minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning
 her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,
 she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. taking her husband’s hand
 in hers began:--
 
“we are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! i know,
 dear; i know that you will always be with to the end.” this was to
 her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. “in
 the morning we go out upon our task, and god alone knows what may be in
 store for any of us. you are going to be so good to as to take me
 with you. i know that all that brave earnest men can do for poor weak
 woman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate
 at stake--you will do. but you must remember that i am not as you are.
 there is poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which
 must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. oh, my friends, you
 know as well as i do, that my soul is at stake; and though i know there
 is one way out for me, you must not and i must not take it!” she looked
 appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.
 
“what is that way?” asked helsing in hoarse voice. “what is that
 way, which we must not--may not--take?”
 
“that i may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before
 the greater evil is entirely wrought. i know, and you know, that were i
 once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you
 did my poor lucy’s. were death, or the fear of death, the only thing
 that stood in the way i would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the
 friends who love me. but death is not all. i cannot believe that to die
 in such case, when there is hope before us and bitter task to be
 done, is god’s will. therefore, i, on my part, give up here the
 certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the
 blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!” we were all
 silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only prelude. the
 faces of the others were set and harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps he
 guessed better than any of us what was coming. she continued:--
 
“this is what i can give into the hotch-pot.” i could not but note the
 quaint legal phrase which she used in such place, and with all
 seriousness. “what will each of you give? your lives i know,” she went
 on quickly, “that is easy for brave men. your lives are god’s, and you
 can give them back to him; but what will you give to me?” she looked
 again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband’s face. quincey
 seemed to understand; nodded, and her face lit up. “then i shall tell
 you plainly what i want, for there must be doubtful matter in this
 connection between us now. you must promise me, one and all--even you,
 my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.”
 
“what is that time?” the voice was quincey’s, but it was low and
 strained.
 
“when you shall be convinced that i am so changed that it is better that
 i die than i may live. when i am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,
 without moment’s delay, drive stake through and cut off my head;
 or do whatever else may be wanting to give rest!”
 
quincey was the first to rise after the pause. knelt down before her
 and taking her hand in his said solemnly:--
 
“i’m only rough fellow, who hasn’t, perhaps, lived as man should to
 win such distinction, but i swear to you by all that i hold sacred and
 dear that, should the time ever come, i shall not flinch from the duty
 that you have set us. and i promise you, too, that i shall make all
 certain, for if i am only doubtful i shall take it that the time has
 come!”
 
“my true friend!” was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,
 bending over, she kissed his hand.
 
“i swear the same, my dear madam mina!” said helsing.
 
“and i!” said lord godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to
 take the oath. i followed, myself. then her husband turned to her
 wan-eyed and with greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of
 his hair, and asked:--
 
“and must i, too, make such promise, oh, my wife?”
 
“you too, my dearest,” she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her
 voice and eyes. “you must not shrink. you are nearest and dearest and
 all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all
 time. think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed
 their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the
 hands of the enemy. their hands did not falter any the more because
 those that they loved implored them to slay them. it is men’s duty
 towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! and oh, my
 dear, if it is to be that i must meet death at any hand, let it be at
 the hand of him that loves best. dr. helsing, i have not
 forgotten your mercy in poor lucy’s case to him who loved”--she stopped
 with flying blush, and changed her phrase--“to him who had best right
 to give her peace. if that time shall come again, i look to you to make
 it happy memory of my husband’s life that it was his loving hand which
 set free from the awful thrall upon me.”
 
“again i swear!” came the professor’s resonant voice. mrs. harker
 smiled, positively smiled, as with sigh of relief she leaned back and
 said:--
 
“and now one word of warning, warning which you must never forget:
 this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in
 such case you must lose time in using your opportunity. at such a
 time i myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued
 with your enemy against you.”
 
“one more request;” she became very solemn as she said this, “it is not
 vital and necessary like the other, but i want you to do one thing for
 me, if you will.” we all acquiesced, but one spoke; there was need
 to speak:--
 
“i want you to read the burial service.” she was interrupted by deep
 groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her
 heart, and continued: “you must read it over some day. whatever may
 be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be sweet
 thought to all or some of us. you, my dearest, will i hope read it, for
 then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!”
 
“but oh, my dear one,” pleaded, “death is afar off from you.”
 
“nay,” she said, holding up warning hand. “i am deeper in death at
 this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!”
 
“oh, my wife, must i read it?” said, before began.
 
“it would comfort me, my husband!” was all she said; and began to
 read when she had got the book ready.
 
“how can i--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its
 solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its
 sweetness. even sceptic, who can see nothing but travesty of bitter
 truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart
 had seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling
 round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of
 her husband’s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he
 had to pause, read the simple and beautiful service from the burial
 of the dead. i--i cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!”
 
* * * * *
 
she was right in her instinct. strange as it all was, bizarre as it may
 hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it
 comforted us much; and the silence, which showed mrs. harker’s coming
 relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any
 of us as we had dreaded.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_15 october, varna._--we left charing cross on the morning of the 12th,
 got to paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the
 orient express. we travelled night and day, arriving here at about five
 o’clock. lord godalming went to the consulate to see if any telegram had
 arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--“the
 odessus.” the journey may have had incidents; i was, however, too eager
 to get on, to care for them. until the _czarina catherine_ comes into
 port there will be interest for in anything in the wide world.
 thank god! mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is
 coming back. she sleeps great deal; throughout the journey she slept
 nearly all the time. before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very
 wakeful and alert; and it has become habit for helsing to
 hypnotise her at such times. at first, some effort was needed, and he
 had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by
 habit, and scarcely any action is needed. seems to have power at
 these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. he
 always asks her what she can see and hear. she answers to the first:--
 
“nothing; all is dark.” and to the second:--
 
“i can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing
 by. canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. the wind is
 high--i can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.”
 it is evident that the _czarina catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on
 her way to varna. lord godalming has just returned. had four
 telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:
 that the _czarina catherine_ had not been reported to lloyd’s from
 anywhere. had arranged before leaving london that his agent should
 send him every day telegram saying if the ship had been reported. he
 was to have message even if she were not reported, so that might be
 sure that there was watch being kept at the other end of the wire.
 
we had dinner and went to bed early. to-morrow we are to see the
 vice-consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship
 as soon as she arrives. helsing says that our chance will be to get
 on the boat between sunrise and sunset. the count, even if takes the
 form of bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and
 so cannot leave the ship. as dare not change to man’s form without
 suspicion--which evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the
 box. if, then, we can come on board after sunrise, is at our mercy;
 for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor lucy,
 before wakes. what mercy shall get from us will not count for
 much. we think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the
 seamen. thank god! this is the country where bribery can do anything,
 and we are well supplied with money. we have only to make sure that the
 ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being
 warned, and we shall be safe. judge moneybag will settle this case, i
 think!
 
* * * * *
 
_16 october._--mina’s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing
 water, darkness and favouring winds. we are evidently in good time, and
 when we hear of the _czarina catherine_ we shall be ready. as she must
 pass the dardanelles we are sure to have some report.
 
* * * * *
 
_17 october._--everything is pretty well fixed now, i think, to welcome
 the count on his return from his tour. godalming told the shippers that
 fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from
 friend of his, and got half consent that might open it at his own
 risk. the owner gave him paper telling the captain to give him every
 facility in doing whatever chose on board the ship, and also a
 similar authorisation to his agent at varna. we have seen the agent, who
 was much impressed with godalming’s kindly manner to him, and we are all
 satisfied that whatever can do to aid our wishes will be done. we
 have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. if the
 count is there, helsing and seward will cut off his head at once and
 drive stake through his heart. morris and godalming and i shall
 prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall
 have ready. the professor says that if we can so treat the count’s body,
 it will soon after fall into dust. in such case there would be no
 evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. but
 even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps
 some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and
 rope. for myself, i should take the chance only too thankfully if it
 were to come. we mean to leave stone unturned to carry out our
 intent. we have arranged with certain officials that the instant the
 _czarina catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by special
 messenger.
 
* * * * *
 
_24 october._--a whole week of waiting. daily telegrams to godalming,
 but only the same story: “not yet reported.” mina’s morning and evening
 hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking
 masts.
 
_telegram, october 24th._
 
_rufus smith, lloyd’s, london, to lord godalming, care of h. b. m.
 vice-consul, varna._
 
“_czarina catherine_ reported this morning from dardanelles.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_25 october._--how i miss my phonograph! to write diary with pen is
 irksome to me; but helsing says i must. we were all wild with
 excitement yesterday when godalming got his telegram from lloyd’s. i
 know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. mrs.
 harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. after
 all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to
 let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any
 excitement when we were in her presence. in old days she would, i am
 sure, have noticed, matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but
 in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. the
 lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is
 getting back some of her colour, helsing and i are not satisfied. we
 talk of her often; we have not, however, said word to the others. it
 would break poor harker’s heart--certainly his nerve--if knew that we
 had even suspicion on the subject. helsing examines, tells me,
 her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for
 says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is active
 danger of change in her. if this change should come, it would be
 necessary to take steps!... we both know what those steps would have to
 be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. we should
 neither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.
 “euthanasia” is an excellent and comforting word! i am grateful to
 whoever invented it.
 
it is only about 24 hours’ sail from the dardanelles to here, at the
 rate the _czarina catherine_ has come from london. she should therefore
 arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in
 before then, we are all about to retire early. we shall get up at one
 o’clock, so as to be ready.
 
* * * * *
 
_25 october, noon_.--no news yet of the ship’s arrival. mrs. harker’s
 hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible
 that we may get news at any moment. we men are all in fever of
 excitement, except harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and
 an hour ago i found him whetting the edge of the great ghoorka knife
 which now always carries with him. it will be bad lookout for the
 count if the edge of that “kukri” ever touches his throat, driven by
 that stern, ice-cold hand!
 
helsing and i were little alarmed about mrs. harker to-day. about
 noon she got into sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we
 kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. she
 had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know
 that she was sleeping. when, however, her husband mentioned casually
 that she was sleeping so soundly that could not wake her, we went to
 her room to see for ourselves. she was breathing naturally and looked so
 well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than
 anything else. poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is wonder
 that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--our opinion was justified, for when after refreshing sleep
 of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had
 been for days. at sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. wherever he
 may be in the black sea, the count is hurrying to his destination. to
 his doom, i trust!
 
* * * * *
 
_26 october._--another day and tidings of the _czarina catherine_.
 she ought to be here by now. that she is still journeying _somewhere_ is
 apparent, for mrs. harker’s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the
 same. it is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;
 some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog
 both to north and south of the port. we must continue our watching, as
 the ship may now be signalled any moment.
 
* * * * *
 
_27 october, noon._--most strange; news yet of the ship we wait for.
 mrs. harker reported last night and this morning as usual: “lapping
 waves and rushing water,” though she added that “the waves were very
 faint.” the telegrams from london have been the same: “no further
 report.” helsing is terribly anxious, and told just now that he
 fears the count is escaping us. added significantly:--
 
“i did not like that lethargy of madam mina’s. souls and memories can do
 strange things during trance.” i was about to ask him more, but harker
 just then came in, and held up warning hand. we must try to-night
 at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.
 
* * * * *
 
_28 october._--telegram. _rufus smith, london, to lord godalming,
 care h. b. m. vice consul, varna._
 
“_czarina catherine_ reported entering galatz at one o’clock
 to-day.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_28 october._--when the telegram came announcing the arrival in galatz i
 do not think it was such shock to any of us as might have been
 expected. true, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would
 come; but i think we all expected that something strange would happen.
 the delay of arrival at varna made us individually satisfied that things
 would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the
 change would occur. none the less, however, was it surprise. i suppose
 that nature works on such hopeful basis that we believe against
 ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know
 that they will be. transcendentalism is beacon to the angels, even if
 it be will-o’-the-wisp to man. it was an odd experience and we all
 took it differently. helsing raised his hand over his head for a
 moment, as though in remonstrance with the almighty; but said not a
 word, and in few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. lord
 godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. i was myself half
 stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. quincey morris
 tightened his belt with that quick movement which i knew so well; in our
 old wandering days it meant “action.” mrs. harker grew ghastly white, so
 that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands
 meekly and looked up in prayer. harker smiled--actually smiled--the
 dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his
 action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of
 the great kukri knife and rested there. “when does the next train start
 for galatz?” said helsing to us generally.
 
“at 6:30 to-morrow morning!” we all started, for the answer came from
 mrs. harker.
 
“how on earth do you know?” said art.
 
“you forget--or perhaps you do not know, though jonathan does and so
 does dr. helsing--that i am the train fiend. at home in exeter i
 always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my
 husband. i found it so useful sometimes, that i always make study of
 the time-tables now. i knew that if anything were to take us to castle
 dracula we should go by galatz, or at any rate through bucharest, so i
 learned the times very carefully. unhappily there are not many to learn,
 as the only train to-morrow leaves as i say.”
 
“wonderful woman!” murmured the professor.
 
“can’t we get special?” asked lord godalming. helsing shook his
 head: “i fear not. this land is very different from yours or mine; even
 if we did have special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our
 regular train. moreover, we have something to prepare. we must think.
 now let us organize. you, friend arthur, go to the train and get the
 tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. do
 you, friend jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him
 letters to the agent in galatz, with authority to make search the ship
 just as it was here. morris quincey, you see the vice-consul, and get
 his aid with his fellow in galatz and all can do to make our way
 smooth, so that times be lost when over the danube. john will stay
 with madam mina and me, and we shall consult. for so if time be long you
 may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since i am here
 with madam to make report.”
 
“and i,” said mrs. harker brightly, and more like her old self than she
 had been for many long day, “shall try to be of use in all ways, and
 shall think and write for you as i used to do. something is shifting
 from in some strange way, and i feel freer than i have been of late!”
 the three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to
 realise the significance of her words; but helsing and i, turning to
 each other, met each grave and troubled glance. we said nothing at the
 time, however.
 
when the three men had gone out to their tasks helsing asked mrs.
 harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of
 harker’s journal at the castle. she went away to get it; when the door
 was shut upon her said to me:--
 
“we mean the same! speak out!”
 
“there is some change. it is hope that makes sick, for it may
 deceive us.”
 
“quite so. do you know why i asked her to get the manuscript?”
 
“no!” said i, “unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing alone.”
 
“you are in part right, friend john, but only in part. i want to tell
 you something. and oh, my friend, i am taking great--a terrible--risk;
 but i believe it is right. in the moment when madam mina said those
 words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. in
 the trance of three days ago the count sent her his spirit to read her
 mind; or more like took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship
 with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. learn
 then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with
 eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as is, in his coffin-box.
 now make his most effort to escape us. at present want her not.
 
“he is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;
 but cut her off--take her, as can do, out of his own power, that
 so she come not to him. ah! there i have hope that our man-brains that
 have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of god, will
 come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,
 that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and
 therefore small. here comes madam mina; not word to her of her trance!
 she know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when
 we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great
 brain which is trained like man’s brain, but is of sweet woman and have
 special power which the count give her, and which may not take away
 altogether--though think not so. hush! let speak, and you shall
 learn. oh, john, my friend, we are in awful straits. i fear, as i never
 feared before. we can only trust the good god. silence! here she comes!”
 
i thought that the professor was going to break down and have hysterics,
 just as had when lucy died, but with great effort controlled
 himself and was at perfect nervous poise when mrs. harker tripped into
 the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly
 forgetful of her misery. as she came in, she handed number of sheets
 of typewriting to helsing. looked over them gravely, his face
 brightening up as read. then holding the pages between his finger and
 thumb said:--
 
“friend john, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,
 dear madam mina, that are young--here is lesson: do not fear ever to
 think. half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but i fear to
 let him loose his wings. here now, with more knowledge, i go back to
 where that half-thought come from and i find that be half-thought
 at all; that be whole thought, though so young that is not yet
 strong to use his little wings. nay, like the “ugly duck” of my friend
 hans andersen, be duck-thought at all, but big swan-thought that
 sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. see i
 read here what jonathan have written:--
 
“that other of his race who, in later age, again and again, brought
 his forces over the great river into turkey land; who, when was
 beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though had to come
 alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,
 since knew that alone could ultimately triumph.”
 
“what does this tell us? not much? no! the count’s child-thought see
 nothing; therefore speak so free. your man-thought see nothing; my
 man-thought see nothing, till just now. no! but there comes another word
 from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what
 it mean--what it _might_ mean. just as there are elements which rest,
 yet when in nature’s course they move on their way and they touch--then
 pouf! and there comes flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill
 and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and
 leagues. is it not so? well, i shall explain. to begin, have you ever
 study the philosophy of crime? ‘yes’ and ‘no.’ you, john, yes; for it is
 study of insanity. you, no, madam mina; for crime touch you not--not
 but once. still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad
 universale_. there is this peculiarity in criminals. it is so constant,
 in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much
 from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. that is to
 be empiric. the criminal always work at one crime--that is the true
 criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.
 this criminal has not full man-brain. is clever and cunning and
 resourceful; but be not of man-stature as to brain. be of
 child-brain in much. now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime
 also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he
 have done. the little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not
 by principle, but empirically; and when learn to do, then there is to
 him the ground to start from to do more. ‘_dos pou sto_,’ said
 archimedes. ‘give fulcrum, and i shall move the world!’ to do once,
 is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until have
 the purpose to do more, continue to do the same again every time,
 just as have done before! oh, my dear, i see that your eyes are
 opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,” for
 mrs. harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. went on:--
 
“now you shall speak. tell us two dry men of science what you see with
 those so bright eyes.” took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.
 his finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as i thought instinctively and
 unconsciously, as she spoke:--
 
“the count is criminal and of criminal type. nordau and lombroso would
 so classify him, and _quâ_ criminal is of imperfectly formed mind.
 thus, in difficulty has to seek resource in habit. his past is a
 clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own
 lips--tells that once before, when in what mr. morris would call a
 ‘tight place,’ went back to his own country from the land had
 tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself
 for new effort. came again better equipped for his work; and won.
 so came to london to invade new land. was beaten, and when all
 hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, fled back over
 the to his home; just as formerly had fled back over the danube
 from turkey land.”
 
“good, good! oh, you so clever lady!” said helsing,
 enthusiastically, as stooped and kissed her hand. moment later he
 said to me, as calmly as though we had been having sick-room
 consultation:--
 
“seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. i have hope.” turning to
 her again, said with keen expectation:--
 
“but go on. go on! there is more to tell if you will. be not afraid;
 john and i know. i do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.
 speak, without fear!”
 
“i will try to; but you will forgive if i seem egotistical.”
 
“nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.”
 
“then, as is criminal is selfish; and as his intellect is small
 and his action is based on selfishness, confines himself to one
 purpose. that purpose is remorseless. as fled back over the danube,
 leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now is intent on being
 safe, careless of all. so his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat
 from the terrible power which acquired over on that dreadful
 night. i felt it! oh, i felt it! thank god, for his great mercy! my soul
 is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me
 is fear lest in some trance or dream may have used my knowledge for
 his ends.” the professor stood up:--
 
“he has so used your mind; and by it has left us here in varna,
 whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to
 galatz, where, doubtless, had made preparation for escaping from us.
 but his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in
 god’s providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for
 his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. the hunter is taken
 in his own snare, as the great psalmist says. for now that think he
 is free from every trace of us all, and that has escaped us with so
 many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to
 sleep. think, too, that as cut himself off from knowing your mind,
 there can be knowledge of him to you; there is where fail! that
 terrible baptism of blood which give you makes you free to go to him
 in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the
 sun rise and set. at such times you go by my volition and not by his;
 and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your
 suffering at his hands. this is now all the more precious that know
 it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his
 knowledge of our where. we, however, are not selfish, and we believe
 that god is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark
 hours. we shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril
 ourselves that we become like him. friend john, this has been great
 hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. you must be scribe
 and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work
 you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.”
 
and so i have written it whilst we wait their return, and mrs. harker
 has written with her typewriter all since she brought the ms. to us.
 



chapter xxvi
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_29 october._--this is written in the train from varna to galatz. last
 night we all assembled little before the time of sunset. each of us
 had done his work as well as could; so far as thought, and endeavour,
 and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and
 for our work when we get to galatz. when the usual time came round mrs.
 harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after longer and
 more serious effort on the part of helsing than has been usually
 necessary, she sank into the trance. usually she speaks on hint; but
 this time the professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty
 resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--
 
“i can see nothing; we are still; there are waves lapping, but only a
 steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. i can hear
 men’s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in
 the rowlocks. gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.
 there is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged
 along. what is this? there is gleam of light; i can feel the air
 blowing upon me.”
 
here she stopped. she had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay
 on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a
 weight. helsing and i looked at each other with understanding.
 quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst
 harker’s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his kukri. there
 was long pause. we all knew that the time when she could speak was
 passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. suddenly she
 sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--
 
“would none of you like cup of tea? you must all be so tired!” we
 could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. she bustled off to get
 tea; when she had gone helsing said:--
 
“you see, my friends. _he_ is close to land: has left his
 earth-chest. but has yet to get on shore. in the night may lie
 hidden somewhere; but if be not carried on shore, or if the ship do
 not touch it, cannot achieve the land. in such case can, if it be
 in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as did
 at whitby. but if the day come before get on shore, then, unless he
 be carried cannot escape. and if be carried, then the customs men
 may discover what the box contain. thus, in fine, if escape not on
 shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.
 we may then arrive in time; for if escape not at night we shall come
 on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for dare not be his
 true self, awake and visible, lest be discovered.”
 
there was more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;
 at which time we might learn more from mrs. harker.
 
early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her
 response in her trance. the hypnotic stage was even longer in coming
 than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was
 so short that we began to despair. helsing seemed to throw his whole
 soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made
 reply:--
 
“all is dark. i hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as
 of wood on wood.” she paused, and the red sun shot up. we must wait till
 to-night.
 
and so it is that we are travelling towards galatz in an agony of
 expectation. we are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;
 but already, at bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot
 possibly get in till well after sun-up. thus we shall have two more
 hypnotic messages from mrs. harker; either or both may possibly throw
 more light on what is happening.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--sunset has come and gone. fortunately it came at time when
 there was distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a
 station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.
 mrs. harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than
 this morning. i am in fear that her power of reading the count’s
 sensations may die away, just when we want it most. it seems to that
 her imagination is beginning to work. whilst she has been in the trance
 hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. if this goes
 on it may ultimately mislead us. if i thought that the count’s power
 over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be
 happy thought; but i am afraid that it may not be so. when she did
 speak, her words were enigmatical:--
 
“something is going out; i can feel it pass like cold wind. i can
 hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,
 fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.” she stopped and a
 shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for few seconds,
 till, at the end, she shook as though in palsy. she said more, even
 in answer to the professor’s imperative questioning. when she woke from
 the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was
 all alert. she could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;
 when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for long time and in
 silence.
 
* * * * *
 
_30 october, 7 a. m._--we are near galatz now, and i may not have time
 to write later. sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.
 knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,
 helsing began his passes earlier than usual. they produced no
 effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with still
 greater difficulty, only minute before the sun rose. the professor
 lost time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--
 
“all is dark. i hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the
 creaking of wood on wood. cattle low far off. there is another sound, a
 queer one like----” she stopped and grew white, and whiter still.
 
“go on; go on! speak, i command you!” said helsing in an agonised
 voice. at the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun
 was reddening even mrs. harker’s pale face. she opened her eyes, and we
 all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost
 unconcern:--
 
“oh, professor, why ask to do what you know i can’t? i don’t remember
 anything.” then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,
 turning from one to the other with troubled look:--
 
“what have i said? what have i done? i know nothing, only that i was
 lying here, half asleep, and heard you say ‘go on! speak, i command you!’
 it seemed so funny to hear you order about, as if i were bad
 child!”
 
“oh, madam mina,” said, sadly, “it is proof, if proof be needed, of
 how i love and honour you, when word for your good, spoken more
 earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom i
 am proud to obey!”
 
the whistles are sounding; we are nearing galatz. we are on fire with
 anxiety and eagerness.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_30 october._--mr. morris took to the hotel where our rooms had been
 ordered by telegraph, being the one who could best be spared, since
 does not speak any foreign language. the forces were distributed
 much as they had been at varna, except that lord godalming went to the
 vice-consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some
 sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. jonathan and the two
 doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival
 of the _czarina catherine_.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--lord godalming has returned. the consul is away, and the
 vice-consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by clerk.
 was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_30 october._--at nine o’clock dr. helsing, dr. seward, and i called
 on messrs. mackenzie & steinkoff, the agents of the london firm of
 hapgood. they had received wire from london, in answer to lord
 godalming’s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in
 their power. they were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once
 on board the _czarina catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river
 harbour. there we saw the captain, donelson by name, who told us of his
 voyage. said that in all his life had never had so favourable a
 run.
 
“man!” said, “but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should
 have to pay for it wi’ some rare piece o’ ill luck, so as to keep up the
 average. it’s canny to run frae london to the black wi’ wind
 ahint ye, as though the deil himself were blawin’ on yer sail for his
 ain purpose. an’ a’ the time we could speer thing. gin we were nigh
 ship, or port, or headland, fog fell on us and travelled wi’ us,
 till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil thing could
 we see. we ran by gibraltar wi’oot bein’ able to signal; an’ till we
 came to the dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we
 never were within hail o’ aught. at first i inclined to slack off sail
 and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, i thocht that if the
 deil was minded to get us into the black quick, was like to do it
 whether we would or no. if we had quick voyage it would be to our
 miscredit wi’ the owners, or hurt to our traffic; an’ the old mon who
 had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no
 hinderin’ him.” this mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition
 and commercial reasoning, aroused helsing, who said:--
 
“mine friend, that devil is more clever than is thought by some; and
 know when meet his match!” the skipper was not displeased with the
 compliment, and went on:--
 
“when we got past the bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o’ them,
 the roumanians, came and asked to heave overboard big box which had
 been put on board by queer lookin’ old man just before we had started
 frae london. i had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa
 fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. man! but the
 supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! i sent them aboot
 their business pretty quick; but as just after fog closed in on us i
 felt wee bit as they did anent something, though i wouldn’t say it was
 agin the big box. well, on we went, and as the fog didn’t let up for
 five days i joost let the wind carry us; for if the deil wanted to get
 somewheres--well, would fetch it up a’reet. an’ if didn’t, well,
 we’d keep sharp lookout anyhow. sure eneuch, we had fair way and
 deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin’ sun came
 through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite galatz.
 the roumanians were wild, and wanted right or wrong to take out the
 box and fling it in the river. i had to argy wi’ them aboot it wi’ a
 handspike; an’ when the last o’ them rose off the deck wi’ his head in
 his hand, i had convinced them that, evil eye or evil eye, the
 property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the
 river danube. they had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to
 fling in, and as it was marked galatz _via_ varna, i thocht i’d let it
 lie till we discharged in the port an’ get rid o’t althegither. we
 didn’t do much clearin’ that day, an’ had to remain the nicht at anchor;
 but in the mornin’, braw an’ airly, an hour before sun-up, man came
 aboard wi’ an order, written to him from england, to receive box
 marked for one count dracula. sure eneuch the matter was one ready to
 his hand. had his papers a’ reet, an’ glad i was to be rid o’ the
 dam’ thing, for i was beginnin’ masel’ to feel uneasy at it. if the deil
 did have any luggage aboord the ship, i’m thinkin’ it was nane ither
 than that same!”
 
“what was the name of the man who took it?” asked dr. helsing with
 restrained eagerness.
 
“i’ll be tellin’ ye quick!” answered, and, stepping down to his
 cabin, produced receipt signed “immanuel hildesheim.” burgen-strasse
 16 was the address. we found out that this was all the captain knew; so
 with thanks we came away.
 
we found hildesheim in his office, hebrew of rather the adelphi
 theatre type, with nose like sheep, and fez. his arguments were
 pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with little
 bargaining told us what knew. this turned out to be simple but
 important. had received letter from mr. ville of london, telling
 him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, box
 which would arrive at galatz in the _czarina catherine_. this was to
 give in charge to certain petrof skinsky, who dealt with the slovaks
 who traded down the river to the port. had been paid for his work by
 an english bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the danube
 international bank. when skinsky had come to him, had taken him to
 the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. that was all
 knew.
 
we then sought for skinsky, but were unable to find him. one of his
 neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that had
 gone away two days before, one knew whither. this was corroborated by
 his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house
 together with the rent due, in english money. this had been between ten
 and eleven o’clock last night. we were at standstill again.
 
whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that
 the body of skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of
 st. peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild
 animal. those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the
 women crying out “this is the work of slovak!” we hurried away lest we
 should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.
 
as we came home we could arrive at definite conclusion. we were all
 convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where
 that might be we would have to discover. with heavy hearts we came home
 to the hotel to mina.
 
when we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking mina
 again into our confidence. things are getting desperate, and it is at
 least chance, though hazardous one. as preliminary step, i was
 released from my promise to her.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_30 october, evening._--they were so tired and worn out and dispirited
 that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so i asked
 them all to lie down for half an hour whilst i should enter everything
 up to the moment. i feel so grateful to the man who invented the
 “traveller’s” typewriter, and to mr. morris for getting this one for
 me. i should have felt quite astray doing the work if i had to write
 with pen....
 
it is all done; poor dear, dear jonathan, what must have suffered,
 what must be suffering now. lies on the sofa hardly seeming to
 breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. his brows are knit; his
 face is drawn with pain. poor fellow, maybe is thinking, and i can
 see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. oh!
 if i could only help at all.... i shall do what i can.
 
i have asked dr. helsing, and has got all the papers that i
 have not yet seen.... whilst they are resting, i shall go over all
 carefully, and perhaps i may arrive at some conclusion. i shall try to
 follow the professor’s example, and think without prejudice on the facts
 before me....
 
* * * * *
 
i do believe that under god’s providence i have made discovery. i
 shall get the maps and look over them....
 
* * * * *
 
i am more than ever sure that i am right. my new conclusion is ready, so
 i shall get our party together and read it. they can judge it; it is
 well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.
 

_mina harker’s memorandum._
 
(entered in her journal.)
 
_ground of inquiry._--count dracula’s problem is to get back to his own
 place.
 
(_a_) must be _brought back_ by some one. this is evident; for had he
 power to move himself as wished could go either as man, or wolf,
 or bat, or in some other way. evidently fears discovery or
 interference, in the state of helplessness in which must be--confined
 as is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.
 
(_b_) _how is to be taken?_--here process of exclusions may help
 us. by road, by rail, by water?
 
1. _by road._--there are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the
 city.
 
(_x_) there are people; and people are curious, and investigate. hint,
 surmise, doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.
 
(_y_) there are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.
 
(_z_) his pursuers might follow. this is his highest fear; and in order
 to prevent his being betrayed has repelled, so far as can, even
 his victim--me!
 
2. _by rail._--there is one in charge of the box. it would have to
 take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies
 on the track. true, might escape at night; but what would be, if
 left in strange place with refuge that could fly to? this is not
 what intends; and does not mean to risk it.
 
3. _by water._--here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most
 danger in another. on the water is powerless except at night; even
 then can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. but were
 wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and would
 indeed be lost. could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were
 unfriendly land, wherein was not free to move, his position would
 still be desperate.
 
we know from the record that was on the water; so what we have to do
 is to ascertain _what_ water.
 
the first thing is to realise exactly what has done as yet; we may,
 then, get light on what his later task is to be.
 
_firstly._--we must differentiate between what did in london as part
 of his general plan of action, when was pressed for moments and had
 to arrange as best could.
 
_secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we
 know of, what has done here.
 
as to the first, evidently intended to arrive at galatz, and sent
 invoice to varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of
 exit from england; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
 the proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to immanuel
 hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. there is
 also the instruction to petrof skinsky. these we must only guess at; but
 there must have been some letter or message, since skinsky came to
 hildesheim.
 
that, so far, his plans were successful we know. the _czarina catherine_
 made phenomenally quick journey--so much so that captain donelson’s
 suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness
 played the count’s game for him, and ran with his favouring wind
 through fogs and all till brought up blindfold at galatz. that the
 count’s arrangements were well made, has been proved. hildesheim cleared
 the box, took it off, and gave it to skinsky. skinsky took it--and here
 we lose the trail. we only know that the box is somewhere on the water,
 moving along. the customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been
 avoided.
 
now we come to what the count must have done after his arrival--_on
 land_, at galatz.
 
the box was given to skinsky before sunrise. at sunrise the count could
 appear in his own form. here, we ask why skinsky was chosen at all to
 aid in the work? in my husband’s diary, skinsky is mentioned as dealing
 with the slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man’s
 remark, that the murder was the work of slovak, showed the general
 feeling against his class. the count wanted isolation.
 
my surmise is, this: that in london the count decided to get back to his
 castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. was brought from
 the castle by szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to slovaks
 who took the boxes to varna, for there they were shipped for london.
 thus the count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this
 service. when the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he
 came out from his box, met skinsky and instructed him what to do as to
 arranging the carriage of the box up some river. when this was done, and
 knew that all was in train, blotted out his traces, as thought,
 by murdering his agent.
 
i have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the
 slovaks to have ascended is either the pruth or the sereth. i read in
 the typescript that in my trance i heard cows low and water swirling
 level with my ears and the creaking of wood. the count in his box, then,
 was on river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or
 poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. there
 would be such sound if floating down stream.
 
of course it may not be either the sereth or the pruth, but we may
 possibly investigate further. now of these two, the pruth is the more
 easily navigated, but the sereth is, at fundu, joined by the bistritza
 which runs up round the borgo pass. the loop it makes is manifestly as
 close to dracula’s castle as can be got by water.
 

_mina harker’s journal--continued._
 
when i had done reading, jonathan took in his arms and kissed me. the
 others kept shaking by both hands, and dr. helsing said:--
 
“our dear madam mina is once more our teacher. her eyes have been where
 we were blinded. now we are on the track once again, and this time we
 may succeed. our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on
 him by day, on the water, our task will be over. has start, but he
 is powerless to hasten, as may not leave his box lest those who carry
 him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw
 him in the stream where perish. this knows, and will not. now men,
 to our council of war; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all
 shall do.”
 
“i shall get steam launch and follow him,” said lord godalming.
 
“and i, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance land,” said mr.
 morris.
 
“good!” said the professor, “both good. but neither must go alone. there
 must be force to overcome force if need be; the slovak is strong and
 rough, and carries rude arms.” all the men smiled, for amongst them
 they carried small arsenal. said mr. morris:--
 
“i have brought some winchesters; they are pretty handy in crowd, and
 there may be wolves. the count, if you remember, took some other
 precautions; made some requisitions on others that mrs. harker could
 not quite hear or understand. we must be ready at all points.” dr.
 seward said:--
 
“i think i had better go with quincey. we have been accustomed to hunt
 together, and we two, well armed, will be match for whatever may come
 along. you must not be alone, art. it may be necessary to fight the
 slovaks, and chance thrust--for i don’t suppose these fellows carry
 guns--would undo all our plans. there must be chances, this time; we
 shall not rest until the count’s head and body have been separated, and
 we are sure that cannot re-incarnate.” looked at jonathan as he
 spoke, and jonathan looked at me. i could see that the poor dear was
 torn about in his mind. of course wanted to be with me; but then the
 boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...
 the ... the ... vampire. (why did i hesitate to write the word?) was
 silent awhile, and during his silence dr. helsing spoke:--
 
“friend jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. first, because you
 are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the
 last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has
 wrought such woe to you and yours. be not afraid for madam mina; she
 will be my care, if i may. i am old. my legs are not so quick to run as
 once; and i am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to
 fight with lethal weapons. but i can be of other service; i can fight in
 other way. and i can die, if need be, as well as younger men. now let
 say that what i would is this: while you, my lord godalming and
 friend jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and
 whilst john and quincey guard the bank where perchance might be
 landed, i will take madam mina right into the heart of the enemy’s
 country. whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running
 stream whence cannot escape to land--where dares not raise the lid
 of his coffin-box lest his slovak carriers should in fear leave him to
 perish--we shall go in the track where jonathan went,--from bistritz
 over the borgo, and find our way to the castle of dracula. here, madam
 mina’s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all
 dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near
 that fateful place. there is much to be done, and other places to be
 made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.” here
 jonathan interrupted him hotly:--
 
“do you mean to say, professor helsing, that you would bring mina,
 in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil’s illness, right
 into the jaws of his death-trap? not for the world! not for heaven or
 hell!” became almost speechless for minute, and then went on:--
 
“do you know what the place is? have you seen that awful den of hellish
 infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every
 speck of dust that whirls in the wind devouring monster in embryo?
 have you felt the vampire’s lips upon your throat?” here turned to
 me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead threw up his arms with cry:
 “oh, my god, what have we done to have this terror upon us!” and sank
 down on the sofa in collapse of misery. the professor’s voice, as he
 spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed
 us all:--
 
“oh, my friend, it is because i would save madam mina from that awful
 place that i would go. god forbid that i should take her into that
 place. there is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not
 see. we men here, all save jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what
 is to be done before that place can be purify. remember that we are in
 terrible straits. if the count escape us this time--and is strong and
 subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for century, and then
 in time our dear one”--he took my hand--“would come to him to keep him
 company, and would be as those others that you, jonathan, saw. you have
 told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they
 clutched the moving bag that the count threw to them. you shudder; and
 well may it be. forgive that i make you so much pain, but it is
 necessary. my friend, is it not dire need for the which i am giving,
 possibly my life? if it were that any one went into that place to stay,
 it is i who would have to go to keep them company.”
 
“do as you will,” said jonathan, with sob that shook him all over, “we
 are in the hands of god!”
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--oh, it did good to see the way that these brave men worked.
 how can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and
 so brave! and, too, it made think of the wonderful power of money!
 what can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do
 when basely used. i felt so thankful that lord godalming is rich, and
 that both and mr. morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing
 to spend it so freely. for if they did not, our little expedition could
 not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within
 another hour. it is not three hours since it was arranged what part each
 of us was to do; and now lord godalming and jonathan have lovely steam
 launch, with steam up ready to start at moment’s notice. dr. seward
 and mr. morris have half dozen good horses, well appointed. we have
 all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. professor
 helsing and i are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for veresti,
 where we are to get carriage to drive to the borgo pass. we are
 bringing good deal of ready money, as we are to buy carriage and
 horses. we shall drive ourselves, for we have one whom we can trust
 in the matter. the professor knows something of great many languages,
 so we shall get on all right. we have all got arms, even for a
 large-bore revolver; jonathan would not be happy unless i was armed like
 the rest. alas! i cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my
 forehead forbids that. dear dr. helsing comforts by telling me
 that i am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting
 colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as
 warnings.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--it took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. we may
 never meet again. courage, mina! the professor is looking at you keenly;
 his look is warning. there must be tears now--unless it may be that
 god will let them fall in gladness.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_october 30. night._--i am writing this in the light from the furnace
 door of the steam launch: lord godalming is firing up. is an
 experienced hand at the work, as has had for years launch of his
 own on the thames, and another on the norfolk broads. regarding our
 plans, we finally decided that mina’s guess was correct, and that if any
 waterway was chosen for the count’s escape back to his castle, the
 sereth and then the bistritza at its junction, would be the one. we took
 it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the
 place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the
 carpathians. we have fear in running at good speed up the river at
 night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to
 make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. lord godalming tells to
 sleep for while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on
 watch. but i cannot sleep--how can i with the terrible danger hanging
 over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... my only
 comfort is that we are in the hands of god. only for that faith it would
 be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. mr.
 morris and dr. seward were off on their long ride before we started;
 they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher
 lands where they can see good stretch of river and avoid the following
 of its curves. they have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead
 their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. when
 they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look
 after the horses. it may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they
 can mount our whole party. one of the saddles has movable horn, and
 can be easily adapted for mina, if required.
 
it is wild adventure we are on. here, as we are rushing along through
 the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike
 us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes
 home. we seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into
 whole world of dark and dreadful things. godalming is shutting the
 furnace door....
 
* * * * *
 
_31 october._--still hurrying along. the day has come, and godalming is
 sleeping. i am on watch. the morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat
 is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. as yet we have passed only
 few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of
 anything like the size of the one we seek. the men were scared every
 time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and
 prayed.
 
* * * * *
 
_1 november, evening._--no news all day; we have found nothing of the
 kind we seek. we have now passed into the bistritza; and if we are wrong
 in our surmise our chance is gone. we have over-hauled every boat, big
 and little. early this morning, one crew took us for government boat,
 and treated us accordingly. we saw in this way of smoothing matters,
 so at fundu, where the bistritza runs into the sereth, we got a
 roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. with every boat which we
 have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every
 deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose
 to ask or do. some of the slovaks tell us that big boat passed them,
 going at more than usual speed as she had double crew on board. this
 was before they came to fundu, so they could not tell us whether the
 boat turned into the bistritza or continued on up the sereth. at fundu
 we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the
 night. i am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell
 upon me, and nature must have rest some time. godalming insists that he
 shall keep the first watch. god bless him for all his goodness to poor
 dear mina and me.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 november, morning._--it is broad daylight. that good fellow would not
 wake me. says it would have been to, for i slept peacefully and
 was forgetting my trouble. it seems brutally selfish to to have slept
 so long, and let him watch all night; but was quite right. i am new
 man this morning; and, as i sit here and watch him sleeping, i can do
 all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and
 keeping watch. i can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to
 me. i wonder where mina is now, and helsing. they should have got to
 veresti about noon on wednesday. it would take them some time to get the
 carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they
 would be about now at the borgo pass. god guide and help them! i am
 afraid to think what may happen. if we could only go faster! but we
 cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. i wonder how
 dr. seward and mr. morris are getting on. there seem to be endless
 streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them
 are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible
 doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have
 met much obstruction. i hope that before we get to strasba we may see
 them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the count, it may be
 necessary to take counsel together what to do next.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_2 november._--three days on the road. news, and time to write it
 if there had been, for every moment is precious. we have had only the
 rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.
 those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. we must push on;
 we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.
 
* * * * *
 
_3 november._--we heard at fundu that the launch had gone up the
 bistritza. i wish it wasn’t so cold. there are signs of snow coming; and
 if it falls heavy it will stop us. in such case we must get sledge and
 go on, russian fashion.
 
* * * * *
 
_4 november._--to-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an
 accident when trying to force way up the rapids. the slovak boats get
 up all right, by aid of rope and steering with knowledge. some went up
 only few hours before. godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and
 evidently it was who put the launch in trim again. finally, they got
 up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase
 afresh. i fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the
 peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept
 stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. we must push
 on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_31 october._--arrived at veresti at noon. the professor tells that
 this morning at dawn could hardly hypnotise at all, and that all i
 could say was: “dark and quiet.” is off now buying carriage and
 horses. says that will later on try to buy additional horses, so
 that we may be able to change them on the way. we have something more
 than 70 miles before us. the country is lovely, and most interesting; if
 only we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to
 see it all. if jonathan and i were driving through it alone what a
 pleasure it would be. to stop and see people, and learn something of
 their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and
 picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint
 people! but, alas!--
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--dr. helsing has returned. has got the carriage and
 horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. the
 landlady is putting us up huge basket of provisions; it seems enough
 for company of soldiers. the professor encourages her, and whispers to
 that it may be week before we can get any good food again. has
 been shopping too, and has sent home such wonderful lot of fur coats
 and wraps, and all sorts of warm things. there will not be any chance of
 our being cold.
 
* * * * *
 
we shall soon be off. i am afraid to think what may happen to us. we are
 truly in the hands of god. alone knows what may be, and i pray him,
 with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that will watch over
 my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, jonathan may know that i
 loved him and honoured him more than i can say, and that my latest and
 truest thought will be always for him.
 



chapter xxvii
 
mina harker’s journal
 

_1 november._--all day long we have travelled, and at good speed. the
 horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go
 willingly their full stage at best speed. we have now had so many
 changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to
 think that the journey will be an easy one. dr. helsing is laconic;
 tells the farmers that is hurrying to bistritz, and pays them well
 to make the exchange of horses. we get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and
 off we go. it is lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable
 kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full
 of nice qualities. they are _very, very_ superstitious. in the first
 house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my
 forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to
 keep off the evil eye. i believe they went to the trouble of putting an
 extra amount of garlic into our food; and i can’t abide garlic. ever
 since then i have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
 escaped their suspicions. we are travelling fast, and as we have no
 driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but i daresay
 that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. the
 professor seems tireless; all day would not take any rest, though he
 made sleep for long spell. at sunset time hypnotised me, and he
 says that i answered as usual “darkness, lapping water and creaking
 wood”; so our enemy is still on the river. i am afraid to think of
 jonathan, but somehow i have now fear for him, or for myself. i write
 this whilst we wait in farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. dr.
 helsing is sleeping. poor dear, looks very tired and old and
 grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as conqueror’s; even in his sleep
 is instinct with resolution. when we have well started i must make
 him rest whilst i drive. i shall tell him that we have days before us,
 and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be
 needed.... all is ready; we are off shortly.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 november, morning._--i was successful, and we took turns driving all
 night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. there is strange
 heaviness in the air--i say heaviness for want of better word; i mean
 that it oppresses us both. it is very cold, and only our warm furs keep
 us comfortable. at dawn helsing hypnotised me; says i answered
 “darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,” so the river is changing as
 they ascend. i do hope that my darling will not run any chance of
 danger--more than need be; but we are in god’s hands.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 november, night._--all day long driving. the country gets wilder as
 we go, and the great spurs of the carpathians, which at veresti seemed
 so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us
 and tower in front. we both seem in good spirits; i think we make an
 effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. dr.
 helsing says that by morning we shall reach the borgo pass. the
 houses are very few here now, and the professor says that the last horse
 we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. he
 got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have rude
 four-in-hand. the dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no
 trouble. we are not worried with other travellers, and so even i can
 drive. we shall get to the pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive
 before. so we take it easy, and have each long rest in turn. oh, what
 will to-morrow bring to us? we go to seek the place where my poor
 darling suffered so much. god grant that we may be guided aright, and
 that will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,
 and who are in such deadly peril. as for me, i am not worthy in his
 sight. alas! i am unclean to his eyes, and shall be until may deign
 to let stand forth in his sight as one of those who have not incurred
 his wrath.
 

_memorandum by abraham helsing._
 
_4 november._--this to my old and true friend john seward, m.d., of
 purfleet, london, in case i may not see him. it may explain. it is
 morning, and i write by fire which all the night i have kept
 alive--madam mina aiding me. it is cold, cold; so cold that the grey
 heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all
 winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. it seems to have
 affected madam mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was
 not like herself. she sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! she who is usual
 so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost
 her appetite. she make entry into her little diary, she who write so
 faithful at every pause. something whisper to that all is not well.
 however, to-night she is more _vif_. her long sleep all day have refresh
 and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. at sunset
 i try to hypnotise her, but alas! with effect; the power has grown
 less and less with each day, and to-night it fail altogether. well,
 god’s will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!
 
now to the historical, for as madam mina write not in her stenography, i
 must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go
 unrecorded.
 
we got to the borgo pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. when i
 saw the signs of the dawn i got ready for the hypnotism. we stopped our
 carriage, and got down so that there might be disturbance. i made a
 couch with furs, and madam mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but
 more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. as
 before, came the answer: “darkness and the swirling of water.” then she
 woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the pass.
 at this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new
 guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to road and say:--
 
“this is the way.”
 
“how know you it?” i ask.
 
“of course i know it,” she answer, and with pause, add: “have not my
 jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?”
 
at first i think somewhat strange, but soon i see that there be only one
 such by-road. it is used but little, and very different from the coach
 road from the bukovina to bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and
 more of use.
 
so we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we
 sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow
 have fallen--the horses know and they only. i give rein to them, and
 they go on so patient. by-and-by we find all the things which jonathan
 have note in that wonderful diary of him. then we go on for long, long
 hours and hours. at the first, i tell madam mina to sleep; she try, and
 she succeed. she sleep all the time; till at the last, i feel myself to
 suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. but she sleep on, and i may
 not wake her though i try. i do not wish to try too hard lest i harm
 her; for i know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be
 all-in-all to her. i think i drowse myself, for all of sudden i feel
 guilt, as though i have done something; i find myself bolt up, with the
 reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. i
 look down and find madam mina still sleep. it is now not far off sunset
 time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,
 so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
 for we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though
 it were the end of the world.
 
then i arouse madam mina. this time she wake with not much trouble, and
 then i try to put her to hypnotic sleep. but she sleep not, being as
 though i were not. still i try and try, till all at once i find her and
 myself in dark; so i look round, and find that the sun have gone down.
 madam mina laugh, and i turn and look at her. she is now quite awake,
 and look so well as i never saw her since that night at carfax when we
 first enter the count’s house. i am amaze, and not at ease then; but she
 is so bright and tender and thoughtful for that i forget all fear. i
 light fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she
 prepare food while i undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,
 to feed. then when i return to the fire she have my supper ready. i go
 to help her; but she smile, and tell that she have eat already--that
 she was so hungry that she would not wait. i like it not, and i have
 grave doubts; but i fear to affright her, and so i am silent of it. she
 help and i eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the
 fire, and i tell her to sleep while i watch. but presently i forget all
 of watching; and when i sudden remember that i watch, i find her lying
 quiet, but awake, and looking at with so bright eyes. once, twice
 more the same occur, and i get much sleep till before morning. when i
 wake i try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes
 obedient, she may not sleep. the sun rise up, and up, and up; and then
 sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. i have
 to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when i have
 harnessed the horses and made all ready. madam still sleep, and she look
 in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. and i like it
 not. and i am afraid, afraid, afraid!--i am afraid of all things--even
 to think but i must go on my way. the stake we play for is life and
 death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.
 
* * * * *
 
_5 november, morning._--let be accurate in everything, for though you
 and i have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think
 that i, helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long
 strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.
 
all yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and
 moving into more and more wild and desert land. there are great,
 frowning precipices and much falling water, and nature seem to have held
 sometime her carnival. madam mina still sleep and sleep; and though i
 did have hunger and appeased it, i could not waken her--even for food. i
 began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as
 she is with that vampire baptism. “well,” said i to myself, “if it be
 that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that i do not sleep at
 night.” as we travel on the rough road, for road of an ancient and
 imperfect kind there was, i held down my head and slept. again i waked
 with sense of guilt and of time passed, and found madam mina still
 sleeping, and the sun low down. but all was indeed changed; the frowning
 mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a
 steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such castle as jonathan tell
 of in his diary. at once i exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,
 the end was near.
 
i woke madam mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!
 unavailing till too late. then, ere the great dark came upon us--for
 even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and
 all was for time in great twilight--i took out the horses and fed
 them in what shelter i could. then i make fire; and near it i make
 madam mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid
 her rugs. i got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that
 she had not hunger. i did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. but
 i myself eat, for i must needs now be strong for all. then, with the
 fear on of what might be, i drew ring so big for her comfort, round
 where madam mina sat; and over the ring i passed some of the wafer, and
 i broke it fine so that all was well guarded. she sat still all the
 time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the
 snow was not more pale; and word she said. but when i drew near, she
 clung to me, and i could know that the poor soul shook her from head to
 feet with tremor that was pain to feel. i said to her presently, when
 she had grown more quiet:--
 
“will you not come over to the fire?” for i wished to make test of
 what she could. she rose obedient, but when she have made step she
 stopped, and stood as one stricken.
 
“why not go on?” i asked. she shook her head, and, coming back, sat
 down in her place. then, looking at with open eyes, as of one waked
 from sleep, she said simply:--
 
“i cannot!” and remained silent. i rejoiced, for i knew that what she
 could not, none of those that we dreaded could. though there might be
 danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!
 
presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till i
 came to them and quieted them. when they did feel my hands on them, they
 whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a
 time. many times through the night did i come to them, till it arrive to
 the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was
 with quiet of them. in the cold hour the fire began to die, and i was
 about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying
 sweeps and with it chill mist. even in the dark there was light of
 some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the
 snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with
 trailing garments. all was in dead, grim silence only that the horses
 whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. i began to
 fear--horrible fears; but then came to the sense of safety in that
 ring wherein i stood. i began, too, to think that my imaginings were of
 the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that i have gone through, and
 all the terrible anxiety. it was as though my memories of all jonathan’s
 horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist
 began to wheel and circle round, till i could get as though shadowy
 glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. and then the horses
 cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. even
 the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. i
 feared for my dear madam mina when these weird figures drew near and
 circled round. i looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when
 i would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught and held
 back, and whispered, like voice that one hears in dream, so low
 it was:--
 
“no! no! do not go without. here you are safe!” i turned to her, and
 looking in her eyes, said:--
 
“but you? it is for you that i fear!” whereat she laughed--a laugh, low
 and unreal, and said:--
 
“fear for _me_! why fear for me? none safer in all the world from them
 than i am,” and as i wondered at the meaning of her words, puff of
 wind made the flame leap up, and i see the red scar on her forehead.
 then, alas! i knew. did i not, i would soon have learned, for the
 wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without
 the holy circle. then they began to materialise till--if god have not
 take away my reason, for i saw it through my eyes--there were before me
 in actual flesh the same three women that jonathan saw in the room, when
 they would have kissed his throat. i knew the swaying round forms, the
 bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous
 lips. they smiled ever at poor dear madam mina; and as their laugh came
 through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to
 her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that jonathan said were
 of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--
 
“come, sister. come to us. come! come!” in fear i turned to my poor
 madam mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the
 terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told story to my
 heart that was all of hope. god be thanked she was not, yet, of them. i
 seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the
 wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. they drew back before me, and
 laughed their low horrid laugh. i fed the fire, and feared them not; for
 i knew that we were safe within our protections. they could not
 approach, me, whilst so armed, nor madam mina whilst she remained within
 the ring, which she could not leave more than they could enter. the
 horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on
 them softly, and they grew whiter. i knew that there was for the poor
 beasts more of terror.
 
and so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the
 snow-gloom. i was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but
 when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to again.
 at the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the
 whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away
 towards the castle, and were lost.
 
instinctively, with the dawn coming, i turned to madam mina, intending
 to hypnotise her; but she lay in deep and sudden sleep, from which i
 could not wake her. i tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made
 response, none at all; and the day broke. i fear yet to stir. i have
 made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. to-day i have
 much to do here, and i keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there
 may be places where i must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist
 obscure it, will be to safety.
 
i will strengthen with breakfast, and then i will to my terrible
 work. madam mina still sleeps; and, god be thanked! she is calm in her
 sleep....
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_4 november, evening._--the accident to the launch has been terrible
 thing for us. only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;
 and by now my dear mina would have been free. i fear to think of her,
 off on the wolds near that horrid place. we have got horses, and we
 follow on the track. i note this whilst godalming is getting ready. we
 have our arms. the szgany must look out if they mean fight. oh, if only
 morris and seward were with us. we must only hope! if i write more
 good-bye, mina! god bless and keep you.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_5 november._--with the dawn we saw the body of szgany before us dashing
 away from the river with their leiter-wagon. they surrounded it in a
 cluster, and hurried along as though beset. the snow is falling lightly
 and there is strange excitement in the air. it may be our own
 feelings, but the depression is strange. far off i hear the howling of
 wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are
 dangers to all of us, and from all sides. the horses are nearly ready,
 and we are soon off. we ride to death of some one. god alone knows who,
 or where, or what, or when, or how it may be....
 

_dr. helsing’s memorandum._
 
_5 november, afternoon._--i am at least sane. thank god for that mercy
 at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. when i left
 madam mina sleeping within the holy circle, i took my way to the castle.
 the blacksmith hammer which i took in the carriage from veresti was
 useful; though the doors were all open i broke them off the rusty
 hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that
 being entered i might not get out. jonathan’s bitter experience served
 here. by memory of his diary i found my way to the old chapel, for i
 knew that here my work lay. the air was oppressive; it seemed as if
 there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made dizzy. either
 there was roaring in my ears or i heard afar off the howl of wolves.
 then i bethought of my dear madam mina, and i was in terrible plight.
 the dilemma had between his horns.
 
her, i had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the
 vampire in that holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! i
 resolve that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must
 submit, if it were god’s will. at any rate it was only death and
 freedom beyond. so did i choose for her. had it but been for myself the
 choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than
 the grave of the vampire! so i make my choice to go on with my work.
 
i knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are
 inhabit; so i search, and search, and i find one of them. she lay in her
 vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that i shudder as
 though i have come to do murder. ah, i doubt not that in old time, when
 such things were, many man who set forth to do such task as mine,
 found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. so delay,
 and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the
 wanton un-dead have hypnotise him; and remain on and on, till sunset
 come, and the vampire sleep be over. then the beautiful eyes of the fair
 woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a
 kiss--and man is weak. and there remain one more victim in the vampire
 fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the un-dead!...
 
there is some fascination, surely, when i am moved by the mere presence
 of such an one, even lying as she lay in tomb fretted with age and
 heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such
 as the lairs of the count have had. yes, i was moved--i, helsing,
 with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--i was moved to a
 yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my
 very soul. it may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the
 strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. certain it
 was that i was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields
 to sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a
 long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke like the sound
 of clarion. for it was the voice of my dear madam mina that i heard.
 
then i braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching
 away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. i dared not
 pause to look on her as i had on her sister, lest once more i should
 begin to be enthrall; but i go on searching until, presently, i find in
 high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister
 which, like jonathan i had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of
 the mist. she was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so
 exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls
 some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl
 with new emotion. but god be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear madam
 mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought
 further upon me, i had nerved myself to my wild work. by this time i had
 searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as i could tell; and as
 there had been only three of these un-dead phantoms around us in the
 night, i took it that there were more of active un-dead existent.
 there was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and
 nobly proportioned. on it was but one word
 
dracula.
 
this then was the un-dead home of the king-vampire, to whom so many more
 were due. its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what i knew.
 before i began to restore these women to their dead selves through my
 awful work, i laid in dracula’s tomb some of the wafer, and so banished
 him from it, un-dead, for ever.
 
then began my terrible task, and i dreaded it. had it been but one, it
 had been easy, comparative. but three! to begin twice more after i had
 been through deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet
 miss lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived
 through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the
 years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....
 
oh, my friend john, but it was butcher work; had i not been nerved by
 thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such pall of
 fear, i could not have gone on. i tremble and tremble even yet, though
 till all was over, god be thanked, my nerve did stand. had i not seen
 the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just
 ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been
 won, i could not have gone further with my butchery. i could not have
 endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of
 writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. i should have fled in terror and
 left my work undone. but it is over! and the poor souls, i can pity them
 now and weep, as i think of them placid each in her full sleep of death
 for short moment ere fading. for, friend john, hardly had my knife
 severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and
 crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come
 centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud “i
 am here!”
 
before i left the castle i so fixed its entrances that never more can
 the count enter there un-dead.
 
when i stepped into the circle where madam mina slept, she woke from her
 sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that i had endured too much.
 
“come!” she said, “come away from this awful place! let us go to meet my
 husband who is, i know, coming towards us.” she was looking thin and
 pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. i was
 glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the
 fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.
 
and so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet
 our friends--and _him_--whom madam mina tell that she _know_ are
 coming to meet us.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_6 november._--it was late in the afternoon when the professor and i
 took our way towards the east whence i knew jonathan was coming. we did
 not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take
 heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being
 left without warmth in the cold and the snow. we had to take some of our
 provisions, too, for we were in perfect desolation, and, so far as we
 could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of
 habitation. when we had gone about mile, i was tired with the heavy
 walking and sat down to rest. then we looked back and saw where the
 clear line of dracula’s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under
 the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the
 carpathian mountains was far below it. we saw it in all its grandeur,
 perched thousand feet on the summit of sheer precipice, and with
 seemingly great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain
 on any side. there was something wild and uncanny about the place. we
 could hear the distant howling of wolves. they were far off, but the
 sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was
 full of terror. i knew from the way dr. helsing was searching about
 that was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less
 exposed in case of attack. the rough roadway still led downwards; we
 could trace it through the drifted snow.
 
in little while the professor signalled to me, so i got up and joined
 him. had found wonderful spot, sort of natural hollow in rock,
 with an entrance like doorway between two boulders. took by the
 hand and drew in: “see!” said, “here you will be in shelter; and
 if the wolves do come i can meet them one by one.” brought in our
 furs, and made snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and
 forced them upon me. but i could not eat; to even try to do so was
 repulsive to me, and, much as i would have liked to please him, i could
 not bring myself to the attempt. looked very sad, but did not
 reproach me. taking his field-glasses from the case, stood on the top
 of the rock, and began to search the horizon. suddenly called out:--
 
“look! madam mina, look! look!” i sprang up and stood beside him on the
 rock; handed his glasses and pointed. the snow was now falling
 more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for high wind was beginning
 to blow. however, there were times when there were pauses between the
 snow flurries and i could see long way round. from the height where we
 were it was possible to see great distance; and far off, beyond the
 white waste of snow, i could see the river lying like black ribbon in
 kinks and curls as it wound its way. straight in front of us and not far
 off--in fact, so near that i wondered we had not noticed before--came a
 group of mounted men hurrying along. in the midst of them was cart, a
 long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like dog’s tail
 wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. outlined against the
 snow as they were, i could see from the men’s clothes that they were
 peasants or gypsies of some kind.
 
on the cart was great square chest. my heart leaped as i saw it, for i
 felt that the end was coming. the evening was now drawing close, and
 well i knew that at sunset the thing, which was till then imprisoned
 there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all
 pursuit. in fear i turned to the professor; to my consternation,
 however, was not there. an instant later, i saw him below me. round
 the rock had drawn circle, such as we had found shelter in last
 night. when had completed it stood beside again, saying:--
 
“at least you shall be safe here from _him_!” took the glasses from
 me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.
 “see,” said, “they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and
 galloping as hard as they can.” paused and went on in hollow
 voice:--
 
“they are racing for the sunset. we may be too late. god’s will be
 done!” down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole
 landscape was blotted out. it soon passed, however, and once more his
 glasses were fixed on the plain. then came sudden cry:--
 
“look! look! look! see, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the
 south. it must be quincey and john. take the glass. look before the snow
 blots it all out!” i took it and looked. the two men might be dr. seward
 and mr. morris. i knew at all events that neither of them was jonathan.
 at the same time i _knew_ that jonathan was not far off; looking around
 i saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at
 break-neck speed. one of them i knew was jonathan, and the other i took,
 of course, to be lord godalming. they, too, were pursuing the party with
 the cart. when i told the professor shouted in glee like schoolboy,
 and, after looking intently till snow fall made sight impossible, he
 laid his winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the
 opening of our shelter. “they are all converging,” said. “when the
 time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.” i got out my revolver
 ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came
 louder and closer. when the snow storm abated moment we looked again.
 it was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,
 and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down
 towards the far mountain tops. sweeping the glass all around us i could
 see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger
 numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.
 
every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. the wind came now in
 fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in
 circling eddies. at times we could not see an arm’s length before us;
 but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to
 clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. we had of
 late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew
 with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the
 sun would set. it was hard to believe that by our watches it was less
 than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various
 bodies began to converge close upon us. the wind came now with fiercer
 and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. it seemingly
 had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,
 the snow fell. we could distinguish clearly the individuals of each
 party, the pursued and the pursuers. strangely enough those pursued did
 not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they
 seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower
 and lower on the mountain tops.
 
closer and closer they drew. the professor and i crouched down behind
 our rock, and held our weapons ready; i could see that was determined
 that they should not pass. one and all were quite unaware of our
 presence.
 
all at once two voices shouted out to: “halt!” one was my jonathan’s,
 raised in high key of passion; the other mr. morris’ strong resolute
 tone of quiet command. the gypsies may not have known the language, but
 there was mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were
 spoken. instinctively they reined in, and at the instant lord godalming
 and jonathan dashed up at one side and dr. seward and mr. morris on the
 other. the leader of the gypsies, splendid-looking fellow who sat his
 horse like centaur, waved them back, and in fierce voice gave to his
 companions some word to proceed. they lashed the horses which sprang
 forward; but the four men raised their winchester rifles, and in an
 unmistakable way commanded them to stop. at the same moment dr. van
 helsing and i rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.
 seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew
 up. the leader turned to them and gave word at which every man of the
 gypsy party drew what weapon carried, knife or pistol, and held
 himself in readiness to attack. issue was joined in an instant.
 
the leader, with quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in
 front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill
 tops--and then to the castle, said something which i did not understand.
 for answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses
 and dashed towards the cart. i should have felt terrible fear at seeing
 jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been
 upon as well as the rest of them; i felt fear, but only wild,
 surging desire to do something. seeing the quick movement of our
 parties, the leader of the gypsies gave command; his men instantly
 formed round the cart in sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one
 shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the
 order.
 
in the midst of this i could see that jonathan on one side of the ring
 of men, and quincey on the other, were forcing way to the cart; it was
 evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun
 should set. nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. neither the
 levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor
 the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their
 attention. jonathan’s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his
 purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they
 cowered, aside and let him pass. in an instant had jumped upon the
 cart, and, with strength which seemed incredible, raised the great
 box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. in the meantime, mr.
 morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of
 szgany. all the time i had been breathlessly watching jonathan i had,
 with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had
 seen the knives of the gypsies flash as won way through them, and
 they cut at him. had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first
 i thought that too had come through in safety; but as sprang
 beside jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, i could see that
 with his left hand was clutching at his side, and that the blood was
 spurting through his fingers. did not delay notwithstanding this, for
 as jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,
 attempting to prize off the lid with his great kukri knife, attacked
 the other frantically with his bowie. under the efforts of both men the
 lid began to yield; the nails drew with quick screeching sound, and
 the top of the box was thrown back.
 
by this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the winchesters,
 and at the mercy of lord godalming and dr. seward, had given in and made
 resistance. the sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the
 shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. i saw the count
 lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from
 the cart had scattered over him. was deathly pale, just like waxen
 image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which i
 knew too well.
 
as i looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them
 turned to triumph.
 
but, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of jonathan’s great knife.
 i shrieked as i saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same
 moment mr. morris’s bowie knife plunged into the heart.
 
it was like miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the
 drawing of breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from
 our sight.
 
i shall be glad as long as i live that even in that moment of final
 dissolution, there was in the face look of peace, such as i never
 could have imagined might have rested there.
 
the castle of dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone
 of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the
 setting sun.
 
the gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary
 disappearance of the dead man, turned, without word, and rode away as
 if for their lives. those who were unmounted jumped upon the
 leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. the wolves,
 which had withdrawn to safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving
 us alone.
 
mr. morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his
 hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. i
 flew to him, for the holy circle did not now keep back; so did the
 two doctors. jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his
 head on his shoulder. with sigh took, with feeble effort, my hand
 in that of his own which was unstained. must have seen the anguish of
 my heart in my face, for smiled at and said:--
 
“i am only too happy to have been of any service! oh, god!” cried
 suddenly, struggling up to sitting posture and pointing to me, “it was
 worth for this to die! look! look!”
 
the sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams
 fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. with one impulse
 the men sank on their knees and deep and earnest “amen” broke from all
 as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. the dying man
 spoke:--
 
“now god be thanked that all has not been in vain! see! the snow is not
 more stainless than her forehead! the curse has passed away!”
 
and, to our bitter grief, with smile and in silence, died, a
 gallant gentleman.
 



note
 

seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of
 some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. it
 is an added joy to mina and to that our boy’s birthday is the same
 day as that on which quincey morris died. his mother holds, i know, the
 secret belief that some of our brave friend’s spirit has passed into
 him. his bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but
 we call him quincey.
 
in the summer of this year we made journey to transylvania, and went
 over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and
 terrible memories. it was almost impossible to believe that the things
 which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were
 living truths. every trace of all that had been was blotted out. the
 castle stood as before, reared high above waste of desolation.
 
when we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all
 look back on without despair, for godalming and seward are both happily
 married. i took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since
 our return so long ago. we were struck with the fact, that in all the
 mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one
 authentic document; nothing but mass of typewriting, except the later
 note-books of mina and seward and myself, and helsing’s memorandum.
 we could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as
 proofs of so wild story. helsing summed it all up as said, with
 our boy on his knee:--
 
“we want proofs; we ask none to believe us! this boy will some day
 know what brave and gallant woman his mother is. already knows her
 sweetness and loving care; later on will understand how some men so
 loved her, that they did dare much for her sake.”

chapter i
 
jonathan harker’s journal
 
(_kept in shorthand._)
 

_3 may. bistritz._--left munich at 8:35 p. m., on 1st may, arriving at
 vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an
 hour late. buda-pesth seems wonderful place, from the glimpse which i
 got of it from the train and the little i could walk through the
 streets. i feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
 late and would start as near the correct time as possible. the
 impression i had was that we were leaving the west and entering the
 east; the most western of splendid bridges over the danube, which is
 here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of turkish
 rule.
 
we left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to klausenburgh.
 here i stopped for the night at the hotel royale. i had for dinner, or
 rather supper, chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
 very good but thirsty. (_mem._, get recipe for mina.) i asked the
 waiter, and said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a
 national dish, i should be able to get it anywhere along the
 carpathians. i found my smattering of german very useful here; indeed, i
 don’t know how i should be able to get on without it.
 
having had some time at my disposal when in london, i had visited the
 british museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library
 regarding transylvania; it had struck that some foreknowledge of the
 country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
 nobleman of that country. i find that the district named is in the
 extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
 transylvania, moldavia and bukovina, in the midst of the carpathian
 mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of europe. i was
 not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
 castle dracula, as there are maps of this country as yet to compare
 with our own ordnance survey maps; but i found that bistritz, the post
 town named by count dracula, is fairly well-known place. i shall enter
 here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when i talk over my
 travels with mina.
 
in the population of transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
 saxons in the south, and mixed with them the wallachs, who are the
 descendants of the dacians; magyars in the west, and szekelys in the
 east and north. i am going among the latter, who claim to be descended
 from attila and the huns. this may be so, for when the magyars conquered
 the country in the eleventh century they found the huns settled in it. i
 read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the
 horseshoe of the carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of
 imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_mem._, i
 must ask the count all about them.)
 
i did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for i had
 all sorts of queer dreams. there was dog howling all night under my
 window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been
 the paprika, for i had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was
 still thirsty. towards morning i slept and was wakened by the continuous
 knocking at my door, so i guess i must have been sleeping soundly then.
 i had for breakfast more paprika, and sort of porridge of maize flour
 which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a
 very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (_mem._, get recipe
 for this also.) i had to hurry breakfast, for the train started little
 before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to
 the station at 7:30 i had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour
 before we began to move. it seems to that the further east you go the
 more unpunctual are the trains. what ought they to be in china?
 
all day long we seemed to dawdle through country which was full of
 beauty of every kind. sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
 top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
 rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
 of them to be subject to great floods. it takes lot of water, and
 running strong, to sweep the outside edge of river clear. at every
 station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
 of attire. some of them were just like the peasants at home or those i
 saw coming through france and germany, with short jackets and round hats
 and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. the women
 looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
 about the waist. they had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
 and most of them had big belts with lot of strips of something
 fluttering from them like the dresses in ballet, but of course there
 were petticoats under them. the strangest figures we saw were the
 slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
 hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
 heavy leather belts, nearly foot wide, all studded over with brass
 nails. they wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
 had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. they are very
 picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. on the stage they would be
 set down at once as some old oriental band of brigands. they are,
 however, i am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural
 self-assertion.
 
it was on the dark side of twilight when we got to bistritz, which is a
 very interesting old place. being practically on the frontier--for the
 borgo pass leads from it into bukovina--it has had very stormy
 existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. fifty years ago series
 of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
 occasions. at the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
 siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
 proper being assisted by famine and disease.
 
count dracula had directed to go to the golden krone hotel, which i
 found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
 course i wanted to see all i could of the ways of the country. i was
 evidently expected, for when i got near the door i faced a
 cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
 undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
 fitting almost too tight for modesty. when i came close she bowed and
 said, “the herr englishman?” “yes,” i said, “jonathan harker.” she
 smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
 who had followed her to the door. went, but immediately returned with
 letter:--
 
“my friend.--welcome to the carpathians. i am anxiously expecting
 you. sleep well to-night. at three to-morrow the diligence will
 start for bukovina; place on it is kept for you. at the borgo
 pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. i trust
 that your journey from london has been happy one, and that you
 will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.
 
“your friend,
 
“dracula.”
 

_4 may._--i found that my landlord had got letter from the count,
 directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
 making inquiries as to details seemed somewhat reticent, and
 pretended that could not understand my german. this could not be
 true, because up to then had understood it perfectly; at least, he
 answered my questions exactly as if did. and his wife, the old
 lady who had received me, looked at each other in frightened sort of
 way. mumbled out that the money had been sent in letter, and that
 was all knew. when i asked him if knew count dracula, and could
 tell anything of his castle, both and his wife crossed themselves,
 and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
 further. it was so near the time of starting that i had time to ask
 any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
 comforting.
 
just before i was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
 very hysterical way:
 
“must you go? oh! young herr, must you go?” she was in such an excited
 state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what german she knew, and
 mixed it all up with some other language which i did not know at all. i
 was just able to follow her by asking many questions. when i told her
 that i must go at once, and that i was engaged on important business,
 she asked again:
 
“do you know what day it is?” i answered that it was the fourth of may.
 she shook her head as she said again:
 
“oh, yes! i know that! i know that, but do you know what day it is?” on
 my saying that i did not understand, she went on:
 
“it is the eve of st. george’s day. do you not know that to-night, when
 the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
 full sway? do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?”
 she was in such evident distress that i tried to comfort her, but
 without effect. finally she went down on her knees and implored not
 to go; at least to wait day or two before starting. it was all very
 ridiculous but i did not feel comfortable. however, there was business
 to be done, and i could allow nothing to interfere with it. i therefore
 tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as i could, that i thanked
 her, but my duty was imperative, and that i must go. she then rose and
 dried her eyes, and taking crucifix from her neck offered it to me. i
 did not know what to do, for, as an english churchman, i have been
 taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
 seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
 state of mind. she saw, i suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
 rosary round my neck, and said, “for your mother’s sake,” and went out
 of the room. i am writing up this part of the diary whilst i am waiting
 for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
 round my neck. whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostly
 traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, i do not know, but i
 am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. if this book should
 ever reach mina before i do, let it bring my good-bye. here comes the
 coach!
 
* * * * *
 
_5 may. the castle._--the grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is
 high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or
 hills i know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are
 mixed. i am not sleepy, and, as i am not to be called till i awake,
 naturally i write till sleep comes. there are many odd things to put
 down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that i dined too well before i
 left bistritz, let put down my dinner exactly. i dined on what they
 called “robber steak”--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red
 pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple
 style of the london cat’s meat! the wine was golden mediasch, which
 produces queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not
 disagreeable. i had only couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.
 
when i got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and i saw him
 talking with the landlady. they were evidently talking of me, for every
 now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting
 on the bench outside the door--which they call by name meaning
 “word-bearer”--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them
 pityingly. i could hear lot of words often repeated, queer words, for
 there were many nationalities in the crowd; so i quietly got my polyglot
 dictionary from my bag and looked them out. i must say they were not
 cheering to me, for amongst them were “ordog”--satan, “pokol”--hell,
 “stregoica”--witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”--both of which mean the same
 thing, one being slovak and the other servian for something that is
 either were-wolf or vampire. (_mem._, i must ask the count about these
 superstitions)
 
when we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time
 swelled to considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and
 pointed two fingers towards me. with some difficulty i got a
 fellow-passenger to tell what they meant; would not answer at
 first, but on learning that i was english, explained that it was a
 charm or guard against the evil eye. this was not very pleasant for me,
 just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one
 seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that i
 could not but be touched. i shall never forget the last glimpse which i
 had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing
 themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of
 rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the
 centre of the yard. then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
 the whole front of the box-seat--“gotza” they call them--cracked his big
 whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on
 our journey.
 
i soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the
 scene as we drove along, although had i known the language, or rather
 languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, i might not have
 been able to throw them off so easily. before us lay green sloping
 land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned
 with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the
 road. there was everywhere bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,
 plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by i could see the green grass under
 the trees spangled with the fallen petals. in and out amongst these
 green hills of what they call here the “mittel land” ran the road,
 losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the
 straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the
 hillsides like tongues of flame. the road was rugged, but still we
 seemed to fly over it with feverish haste. i could not understand then
 what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no
 time in reaching borgo prund. i was told that this road is in summertime
 excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter
 snows. in this respect it is different from the general run of roads in
 the carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept
 in too good order. of old the hospadars would not repair them, lest the
 turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,
 and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.
 
beyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopes
 of forest up to the lofty steeps of the carpathians themselves. right
 and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon
 them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,
 deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where
 grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and
 pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where
 the snowy peaks rose grandly. here and there seemed mighty rifts in the
 mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again
 the white gleam of falling water. one of my companions touched my arm as
 we swept round the base of hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered
 peak of mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to
 be right before us:--
 
“look! isten szek!”--“god’s seat!”--and crossed himself reverently.
 
as we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind
 us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. this was
 emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the
 sunset, and seemed to glow out with delicate cool pink. here and there
 we passed cszeks and slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but i noticed
 that goitre was painfully prevalent. by the roadside were many crosses,
 and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. here and there
 was peasant man or woman kneeling before shrine, who did not even
 turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of
 devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. there were
 many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here
 and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems
 shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. now and
 again we passed leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant’s cart--with its
 long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the
 road. on this were sure to be seated quite group of home-coming
 peasants, the cszeks with their white, and the slovaks with their
 coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long
 staves, with axe at end. as the evening fell it began to get very cold,
 and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
 gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which
 ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the
 pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of
 late-lying snow. sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods
 that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of
 greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a
 peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and
 grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset
 threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the
 carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. sometimes the
 hills were so steep that, despite our driver’s haste, the horses could
 only go slowly. i wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,
 but the driver would not hear of it. “no, no,” said; “you must not
 walk here; the dogs are too fierce”; and then added, with what he
 evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for looked round to catch the
 approving smile of the rest--“and you may have enough of such matters
 before you go to sleep.” the only stop would make was moment’s
 pause to light his lamps.
 
when it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the
 passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as
 though urging him to further speed. lashed the horses unmercifully
 with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on
 to further exertions. then through the darkness i could see sort of
 patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were cleft in the
 hills. the excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach
 rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like boat tossed on a
 stormy sea. i had to hold on. the road grew more level, and we appeared
 to fly along. then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each
 side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the borgo pass. one
 by one several of the passengers offered gifts, which they pressed
 upon with an earnestness which would take denial; these were
 certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good
 faith, with kindly word, and blessing, and that strange mixture of
 fear-meaning movements which i had seen outside the hotel at
 bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
 then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the
 passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the
 darkness. it was evident that something very exciting was either
 happening or expected, but though i asked each passenger, one would
 give the slightest explanation. this state of excitement kept on for
 some little time; and at last we saw before us the pass opening out on
 the eastern side. there were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the
 air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. it seemed as though the
 mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got
 into the thunderous one. i was now myself looking out for the conveyance
 which was to take to the count. each moment i expected to see the
 glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. the only light
 was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our
 hard-driven horses rose in white cloud. we could see now the sandy
 road lying white before us, but there was on it sign of vehicle.
 the passengers drew back with sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock
 my own disappointment. i was already thinking what i had best do, when
 the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which i
 could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low tone; i
 thought it was “an hour less than the time.” then turning to me, said
 in german worse than my own:--
 
“there is carriage here. the herr is not expected after all. will
 now come on to bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better
 the next day.” whilst was speaking the horses began to neigh and
 snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. then,
 amongst chorus of screams from the peasants and universal crossing
 of themselves, calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook
 us, and drew up beside the coach. i could see from the flash of our
 lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and
 splendid animals. they were driven by tall man, with long brown
 beard and great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. i
 could only see the gleam of pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red
 in the lamplight, as turned to us. said to the driver:--
 
“you are early to-night, my friend.” the man stammered in reply:--
 
“the english herr was in hurry,” to which the stranger replied:--
 
“that is why, i suppose, you wished him to go on to bukovina. you cannot
 deceive me, my friend; i know too much, and my horses are swift.” as he
 spoke smiled, and the lamplight fell on hard-looking mouth, with
 very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. one of my
 companions whispered to another the line from burger’s “lenore”:--
 
“denn die todten reiten schnell”--
 (“for the dead travel fast.”)
 
the strange driver evidently heard the words, for looked up with a
 gleaming smile. the passenger turned his face away, at the same time
 putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. “give the herr’s
 luggage,” said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were
 handed out and put in the calèche. then i descended from the side of the
 coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping with a
 hand which caught my arm in grip of steel; his strength must have been
 prodigious. without word shook his reins, the horses turned, and we
 swept into the darkness of the pass. as i looked back i saw the steam
 from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected
 against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. then
 the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept
 on their way to bukovina. as they sank into the darkness i felt a
 strange chill, and lonely feeling came over me; but cloak was thrown
 over my shoulders, and rug across my knees, and the driver said in
 excellent german:--
 
“the night is chill, mein herr, and my master the count bade take all
 care of you. there is flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the
 country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.” i did not take
 any, but it was comfort to know it was there all the same. i felt a
 little strangely, and not little frightened. i think had there been
 any alternative i should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that
 unknown night journey. the carriage went at hard pace straight along,
 then we made complete turn and went along another straight road. it
 seemed to that we were simply going over and over the same ground
 again; and so i took note of some salient point, and found that this was
 so. i would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but
 i really feared to do so, for i thought that, placed as i was, any
 protest would have had effect in case there had been an intention to
 delay. by-and-by, however, as i was curious to know how time was
 passing, i struck match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was
 within few minutes of midnight. this gave sort of shock, for i
 suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my
 recent experiences. i waited with sick feeling of suspense.
 
then dog began to howl somewhere in farmhouse far down the road--a
 long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. the sound was taken up by
 another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which
 now sighed softly through the pass, wild howling began, which seemed
 to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp
 it through the gloom of the night. at the first howl the horses began to
 strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they
 quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after runaway from
 sudden fright. then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each
 side of us began louder and sharper howling--that of wolves--which
 affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for i was minded to
 jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged
 madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them
 from bolting. in few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to
 the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able
 to descend and to stand before them. petted and soothed them, and
 whispered something in their ears, as i have heard of horse-tamers
 doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became
 quite manageable again, though they still trembled. the driver again
 took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at great pace. this
 time, after going to the far side of the pass, suddenly turned down a
 narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.
 
soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the
 roadway till we passed as through tunnel; and again great frowning
 rocks guarded us boldly on either side. though we were in shelter, we
 could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the
 rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.
 it grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,
 so that soon we and all around us were covered with white blanket. the
 keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew
 fainter as we went on our way. the baying of the wolves sounded nearer
 and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. i
 grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. the driver,
 however, was not in the least disturbed; kept turning his head to
 left and right, but i could not see anything through the darkness.
 
suddenly, away on our left, i saw faint flickering blue flame. the
 driver saw it at the same moment; at once checked the horses, and,
 jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. i did not know
 what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while
 i wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without word took
 his seat, and we resumed our journey. i think i must have fallen asleep
 and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated
 endlessly, and now looking back, it is like sort of awful nightmare.
 once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness
 around us i could watch the driver’s motions. went rapidly to where
 the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem
 to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering few stones,
 formed them into some device. once there appeared strange optical
 effect: when stood between and the flame did not obstruct it,
 for i could see its ghostly flicker all the same. this startled me, but
 as the effect was only momentary, i took it that my eyes deceived me
 straining through the darkness. then for time there were blue
 flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the
 wolves around us, as though they were following in moving circle.
 
at last there came time when the driver went further afield than he
 had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse
 than ever and to snort and scream with fright. i could not see any cause
 for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just
 then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the
 jagged crest of beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light i saw
 around us ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,
 with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. they were hundred times more
 terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.
 for myself, i felt sort of paralysis of fear. it is only when man
 feels himself face to face with such horrors that can understand
 their true import.
 
all at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had
 some peculiar effect on them. the horses jumped about and reared, and
 looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in way painful to see;
 but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they
 had perforce to remain within it. i called to the coachman to come, for
 it seemed to that our only chance was to try to break out through the
 ring and to aid his approach. i shouted and beat the side of the
 calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as
 to give him chance of reaching the trap. how came there, i know
 not, but i heard his voice raised in tone of imperious command, and
 looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. as swept his
 long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves
 fell back and back further still. just then heavy cloud passed across
 the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.
 
when i could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the
 wolves had disappeared. this was all so strange and uncanny that a
 dreadful fear came upon me, and i was afraid to speak or move. the time
 seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete
 darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. we kept on
 ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main
 always ascending. suddenly, i became conscious of the fact that the
 driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a
 vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came ray of light,
 and whose broken battlements showed jagged line against the moonlit
 sky.
 



chapter ii
 
jonathan harker’s journal--_continued_
 

_5 may._--i must have been asleep, for certainly if i had been fully
 awake i must have noticed the approach of such remarkable place. in
 the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark
 ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than
 it really is. i have not yet been able to see it by daylight.
 
when the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand
 to assist to alight. again i could not but notice his prodigious
 strength. his hand actually seemed like steel vice that could have
 crushed mine if had chosen. then took out my traps, and placed
 them on the ground beside as i stood close to great door, old and
 studded with large iron nails, and set in projecting doorway of
 massive stone. i could see even in the dim light that the stone was
 massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and
 weather. as i stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the
 reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one
 of the dark openings.
 
i stood in silence where i was, for i did not know what to do. of bell
 or knocker there was sign; through these frowning walls and dark
 window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. the
 time i waited seemed endless, and i felt doubts and fears crowding upon
 me. what sort of place had i come to, and among what kind of people?
 what sort of grim adventure was it on which i had embarked? was this a
 customary incident in the life of solicitor’s clerk sent out to
 explain the purchase of london estate to foreigner? solicitor’s
 clerk! mina would not like that. solicitor--for just before leaving
 london i got word that my examination was successful; and i am now a
 full-blown solicitor! i began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if
 i were awake. it all seemed like horrible nightmare to me, and i
 expected that i should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with
 the dawn struggling in through the windows, as i had now and again felt
 in the morning after day of overwork. but my flesh answered the
 pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. i was indeed awake
 and among the carpathians. all i could do now was to be patient, and to
 wait the coming of the morning.
 
just as i had come to this conclusion i heard heavy step approaching
 behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of coming
 light. then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of
 massive bolts drawn back. key was turned with the loud grating noise
 of long disuse, and the great door swung back.
 
within, stood tall old man, clean shaven save for long white
 moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without single speck
 of colour about him anywhere. held in his hand an antique silver
 lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,
 throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the
 open door. the old man motioned in with his right hand with courtly
 gesture, saying in excellent english, but with strange intonation:--
 
“welcome to my house! enter freely and of your own will!” made no
 motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like statue, as though his
 gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. the instant, however, that
 i had stepped over the threshold, moved impulsively forward, and
 holding out his hand grasped mine with strength which made wince,
 an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as
 ice--more like the hand of dead than living man. again said:--
 
“welcome to my house. come freely. go safely; and leave something of the
 happiness you bring!” the strength of the handshake was so much akin to
 that which i had noticed in the driver, whose face i had not seen, that
 for moment i doubted if it were not the same person to whom i was
 speaking; so to make sure, i said interrogatively:--
 
“count dracula?” bowed in courtly way as replied:--
 
“i am dracula; and i bid you welcome, mr. harker, to my house. come in;
 the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.” as was
 speaking, put the lamp on bracket on the wall, and stepping out,
 took my luggage; had carried it in before i could forestall him. i
 protested but insisted:--
 
“nay, sir, you are my guest. it is late, and my people are not
 available. let see to your comfort myself.” insisted on carrying
 my traps along the passage, and then up great winding stair, and
 along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang
 heavily. at the end of this threw open heavy door, and i rejoiced
 to see within well-lit room in which table was spread for supper,
 and on whose mighty hearth great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
 flamed and flared.
 
the count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing
 the room, opened another door, which led into small octagonal room lit
 by single lamp, and seemingly without window of any sort. passing
 through this, opened another door, and motioned to enter. it was a
 welcome sight; for here was great bedroom well lighted and warmed with
 another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were
 fresh--which sent hollow roar up the wide chimney. the count himself
 left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before closed the
 door:--
 
“you will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your
 toilet. i trust you will find all you wish. when you are ready, come
 into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.”
 
the light and warmth and the count’s courteous welcome seemed to have
 dissipated all my doubts and fears. having then reached my normal state,
 i discovered that i was half famished with hunger; so making hasty
 toilet, i went into the other room.
 
i found supper already laid out. my host, who stood on one side of the
 great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made graceful wave of
 his hand to the table, and said:--
 
“i pray you, be seated and sup how you please. you will, i trust, excuse
 that i do not join you; but i have dined already, and i do not sup.”
 
i handed to him the sealed letter which mr. hawkins had entrusted to me.
 opened it and read it gravely; then, with charming smile, handed
 it to to read. one passage of it, at least, gave thrill of
 pleasure.
 
“i must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady i am constant
 sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to
 come; but i am happy to say i can send sufficient substitute, one in
 whom i have every possible confidence. is young man, full of energy
 and talent in his own way, and of very faithful disposition. is
 discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. shall
 be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take
 your instructions in all matters.”
 
the count himself came forward and took off the cover of dish, and i
 fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. this, with some cheese
 and salad and bottle of old tokay, of which i had two glasses, was
 my supper. during the time i was eating it the count asked many
 questions as to my journey, and i told him by degrees all i had
 experienced.
 
by this time i had finished my supper, and by my host’s desire had drawn
 up chair by the fire and begun to smoke cigar which offered me,
 at the same time excusing himself that did not smoke. i had now an
 opportunity of observing him, and found him of very marked
 physiognomy.
 
his face was strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the
 thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and
 hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. his
 eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy
 hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. the mouth, so far as i
 could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather
 cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over
 the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a
 man of his years. for the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops
 extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm
 though thin. the general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.
 
hitherto i had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
 in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing
 them now close to me, i could not but notice that they were rather
 coarse--broad, with squat fingers. strange to say, there were hairs in
 the centre of the palm. the nails were long and fine, and cut to sharp
 point. as the count leaned over and his hands touched me, i could not
 repress shudder. it may have been that his breath was rank, but a
 horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what i would, i could
 not conceal. the count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a
 grim sort of smile, which showed more than had yet done his
 protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the
 fireplace. we were both silent for while; and as i looked towards the
 window i saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. there seemed a
 strange stillness over everything; but as i listened i heard as if from
 down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. the count’s eyes
 gleamed, and said:--
 
“listen to them--the children of the night. what music they make!”
 seeing, i suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he
 added:--
 
“ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the
 hunter.” then rose and said:--
 
“but you must be tired. your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you
 shall sleep as late as you will. i have to be away till the afternoon;
 so sleep well and dream well!” with courteous bow, opened for me
 himself the door to the octagonal room, and i entered my bedroom....
 
i am all in of wonders. i doubt; i fear; i think strange things,
 which i dare not confess to my own soul. god keep me, if only for the
 sake of those dear to me!
 
* * * * *
 
_7 may._--it is again early morning, but i have rested and enjoyed the
 last twenty-four hours. i slept till late in the day, and awoke of my
 own accord. when i had dressed myself i went into the room where we had
 supped, and found cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the
 pot being placed on the hearth. there was card on the table, on which
 was written:--
 
“i have to be absent for while. do not wait for me.--d.” i set to and
 enjoyed hearty meal. when i had done, i looked for bell, so that i
 might let the servants know i had finished; but i could not find one.
 there are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the
 extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. the table service
 is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.
 the curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of
 my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have
 been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,
 though in excellent order. i saw something like them in hampton court,
 but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. but still in none of
 the rooms is there mirror. there is not even toilet glass on my
 table, and i had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before i
 could either shave or brush my hair. i have not yet seen servant
 anywhere, or heard sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.
 some time after i had finished my meal--i do not know whether to call it
 breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o’clock when i had
 it--i looked about for something to read, for i did not like to go about
 the castle until i had asked the count’s permission. there was
 absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing
 materials; so i opened another door in the room and found sort of
 library. the door opposite mine i tried, but found it locked.
 
in the library i found, to my great delight, vast number of english
 books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and
 newspapers. table in the centre was littered with english magazines
 and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. the books
 were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political
 economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to england and english life
 and customs and manners. there were even such books of reference as the
 london directory, the “red” and “blue” books, whitaker’s almanac, the
 army and navy lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the
 law list.
 
whilst i was looking at the books, the door opened, and the count
 entered. saluted in hearty way, and hoped that i had had good
 night’s rest. then went on:--
 
“i am glad you found your way in here, for i am sure there is much that
 will interest you. these companions”--and laid his hand on some of
 the books--“have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever
 since i had the idea of going to london, have given many, many hours
 of pleasure. through them i have come to know your great england; and to
 know her is to love her. i long to go through the crowded streets of
 your mighty london, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of
 humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes
 it what it is. but alas! as yet i only know your tongue through books.
 to you, my friend, i look that i know it to speak.”
 
“but, count,” i said, “you know and speak english thoroughly!” bowed
 gravely.
 
“i thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet i
 fear that i am but little way on the road i would travel. true, i know
 the grammar and the words, but yet i know not how to speak them.”
 
“indeed,” i said, “you speak excellently.”
 
“not so,” answered. “well, i know that, did i move and speak in your
 london, none there are who would not know for stranger. that is not
 enough for me. here i am noble; i am _boyar_; the common people know me,
 and i am master. but stranger in strange land, is one; men
 know him not--and to know not is to care not for. i am content if i am
 like the rest, so that man stops if see me, or pause in his
 speaking if hear my words, ‘ha, ha! stranger!’ i have been so long
 master that i would be master still--or at least that none other should
 be master of me. you come to not alone as agent of my friend peter
 hawkins, of exeter, to tell all about my new estate in london. you
 shall, i trust, rest here with awhile, so that by our talking i may
 learn the english intonation; and i would that you tell when i make
 error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. i am sorry that i had to be
 away so long to-day; but you will, i know, forgive one who has so many
 important affairs in hand.”
 
of course i said all i could about being willing, and asked if i might
 come into that room when i chose. answered: “yes, certainly,” and
 added:--
 
“you may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are
 locked, where of course you will not wish to go. there is reason that
 all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with
 my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.” i said i was sure of
 this, and then went on:--
 
“we are in transylvania; and transylvania is not england. our ways are
 not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. nay, from
 what you have told of your experiences already, you know something of
 what strange things there may be.”
 
this led to much conversation; and as it was evident that wanted to
 talk, if only for talking’s sake, i asked him many questions regarding
 things that had already happened to or come within my notice.
 sometimes sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by
 pretending not to understand; but generally answered all i asked most
 frankly. then as time went on, and i had got somewhat bolder, i asked
 him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for
 instance, why the coachman went to the places where had seen the blue
 flames. then explained to that it was commonly believed that on a
 certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits
 are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place
 where treasure has been concealed. “that treasure has been hidden,” he
 went on, “in the region through which you came last night, there can be
 but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the
 wallachian, the saxon, and the turk. why, there is hardly foot of soil
 in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,
 patriots or invaders. in old days there were stirring times, when the
 austrian and the hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out
 to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited
 their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep
 destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. when the invader
 was triumphant found but little, for whatever there was had been
 sheltered in the friendly soil.”
 
“but how,” said i, “can it have remained so long undiscovered, when
 there is sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?”
 the count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,
 sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; answered:--
 
“because your peasant is at heart coward and fool! those flames only
 appear on one night; and on that night man of this land will, if he
 can help it, stir without his doors. and, dear sir, even if did he
 would not know what to do. why, even the peasant that you tell of who
 marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight
 even for his own work. even you would not, i dare be sworn, be able to
 find these places again?”
 
“there you are right,” i said. “i know more than the dead where even
 to look for them.” then we drifted into other matters.
 
“come,” said at last, “tell of london and of the house which you
 have procured for me.” with an apology for my remissness, i went into my
 own room to get the papers from my bag. whilst i was placing them in
 order i heard rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as i
 passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp
 lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. the lamps were also lit
 in the study or library, and i found the count lying on the sofa,
 reading, of all things in the world, an english bradshaw’s guide. when i
 came in cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him i
 went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. was interested in
 everything, and asked myriad questions about the place and its
 surroundings. clearly had studied beforehand all could get on the
 subject of the neighbourhood, for evidently at the end knew very much
 more than i did. when i remarked this, answered:--
 
“well, but, my friend, is it not needful that i should? when i go there
 i shall be all alone, and my friend harker jonathan--nay, pardon me, i
 fall into my country’s habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend
 jonathan harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. will be
 in exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my
 other friend, peter hawkins. so!”
 
we went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at
 purfleet. when i had told him the facts and got his signature to the
 necessary papers, and had written letter with them ready to post to
 mr. hawkins, began to ask how i had come across so suitable a
 place. i read to him the notes which i had made at the time, and which i
 inscribe here:--
 
“at purfleet, on by-road, i came across just such place as seemed to
 be required, and where was displayed dilapidated notice that the place
 was for sale. it is surrounded by high wall, of ancient structure,
 built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for large number of
 years. the closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with
 rust.
 
“the estate is called carfax, doubt corruption of the old _quatre
 face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of
 the compass. it contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by
 the solid stone wall above mentioned. there are many trees on it, which
 make it in places gloomy, and there is deep, dark-looking pond or
 small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and
 flows away in fair-sized stream. the house is very large and of all
 periods back, i should say, to mediæval times, for one part is of stone
 immensely thick, with only few windows high up and heavily barred with
 iron. it looks like part of keep, and is close to an old chapel or
 church. i could not enter it, as i had not the key of the door leading
 to it from the house, but i have taken with my kodak views of it from
 various points. the house has been added to, but in very straggling
 way, and i can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must
 be very great. there are but few houses close at hand, one being very
 large house only recently added to and formed into private lunatic
 asylum. it is not, however, visible from the grounds.”
 
when i had finished, said:--
 
“i am glad that it is old and big. i myself am of an old family, and to
 live in new house would kill me. house cannot be made habitable in a
 day; and, after all, how few days go to make up century. i rejoice
 also that there is chapel of old times. we transylvanian nobles love
 not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. i seek not
 gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and
 sparkling waters which please the young and gay. i am longer young;
 and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not
 attuned to mirth. moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the
 shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken
 battlements and casements. i love the shade and the shadow, and would
 be alone with my thoughts when i may.” somehow his words and his look
 did not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his
 smile look malignant and saturnine.
 
presently, with an excuse, left me, asking to put all my papers
 together. was some little time away, and i began to look at some of
 the books around me. one was an atlas, which i found opened naturally at
 england, as if that map had been much used. on looking at it i found in
 certain places little rings marked, and on examining these i noticed
 that one was near london on the east side, manifestly where his new
 estate was situated; the other two were exeter, and whitby on the
 yorkshire coast.
 
it was the better part of an hour when the count returned. “aha!” he
 said; “still at your books? good! but you must not work always. come; i
 am informed that your supper is ready.” took my arm, and we went into
 the next room, where i found an excellent supper ready on the table. the
 count again excused himself, as had dined out on his being away from
 home. but sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst i ate.
 after supper i smoked, as on the last evening, and the count stayed with
 me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour
 after hour. i felt that it was getting very late indeed, but i did not
 say anything, for i felt under obligation to meet my host’s wishes in
 every way. i was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified
 me; but i could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at
 the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.
 they say that people who are near death die generally at the change to
 the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and
 tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere
 can well believe it. all at once we heard the crow of cock coming up
 with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; count
 dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--
 
“why, there is the morning again! how remiss i am to let you stay up so
 long. you must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of
 england less interesting, so that i may not forget how time flies by
 us,” and, with courtly bow, quickly left me.
 
i went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to
 notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all i could see was the
 warm grey of quickening sky. so i pulled the curtains again, and have
 written of this day.
 
* * * * *
 
_8 may._--i began to fear as i wrote in this book that i was getting too
 diffuse; but now i am glad that i went into detail from the first, for
 there is something so strange about this place and all in it that i
 cannot but feel uneasy. i wish i were safe out of it, or that i had
 never come. it may be that this strange night-existence is telling on
 me; but would that that were all! if there were any one to talk to i
 could bear it, but there is one. i have only the count to speak with,
 and he!--i fear i am myself the only living soul within the place. let
 be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help to bear up, and
 imagination must not run riot with me. if it does i am lost. let say
 at once how i stand--or seem to.
 
i only slept few hours when i went to bed, and feeling that i could
 not sleep any more, got up. i had hung my shaving glass by the window,
 and was just beginning to shave. suddenly i felt hand on my shoulder,
 and heard the count’s voice saying to me, “good-morning.” i started, for
 it amazed that i had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass
 covered the whole room behind me. in starting i had cut myself slightly,
 but did not notice it at the moment. having answered the count’s
 salutation, i turned to the glass again to see how i had been mistaken.
 this time there could be error, for the man was close to me, and i
 could see him over my shoulder. but there was reflection of him in
 the mirror! the whole room behind was displayed; but there was no
 sign of man in it, except myself. this was startling, and, coming on
 the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague
 feeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count is near; but at
 the instant i saw that the cut had bled little, and the blood was
 trickling over my chin. i laid down the razor, turning as i did so half
 round to look for some sticking plaster. when the count saw my face, his
 eyes blazed with sort of demoniac fury, and suddenly made grab at
 my throat. i drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which
 held the crucifix. it made an instant change in him, for the fury passed
 so quickly that i could hardly believe that it was ever there.
 
“take care,” said, “take care how you cut yourself. it is more
 dangerous than you think in this country.” then seizing the shaving
 glass, went on: “and this is the wretched thing that has done the
 mischief. it is foul bauble of man’s vanity. away with it!” and
 opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, flung
 out the glass, which was shattered into thousand pieces on the stones
 of the courtyard far below. then withdrew without word. it is very
 annoying, for i do not see how i am to shave, unless in my watch-case or
 the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.
 
when i went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but i could
 not find the count anywhere. so i breakfasted alone. it is strange that
 as yet i have not seen the count eat or drink. must be very
 peculiar man! after breakfast i did little exploring in the castle. i
 went out on the stairs, and found room looking towards the south. the
 view was magnificent, and from where i stood there was every opportunity
 of seeing it. the castle is on the very edge of terrible precipice. a
 stone falling from the window would fall thousand feet without
 touching anything! as far as the eye can reach is of green tree
 tops, with occasionally deep rift where there is chasm. here and
 there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through
 the forests.
 
but i am not in heart to describe beauty, for when i had seen the view i
 explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and
 bolted. in place save from the windows in the castle walls is there
 an available exit.
 
the castle is veritable prison, and i am prisoner!
 



chapter iii
 
jonathan harker’s journal--_continued_
 

when i found that i was prisoner sort of wild feeling came over me.
 i rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of
 every window i could find; but after little the conviction of my
 helplessness overpowered all other feelings. when i look back after a
 few hours i think i must have been mad for the time, for i behaved much
 as rat does in trap. when, however, the conviction had come to me
 that i was helpless i sat down quietly--as quietly as i have ever done
 anything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. i
 am thinking still, and as yet have come to definite conclusion. of
 one thing only am i certain; that it is use making my ideas known to
 the count. knows well that i am imprisoned; and as has done it
 himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, would only deceive
 if i trusted him fully with the facts. so far as i can see, my only
 plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes
 open. i am, i know, either being deceived, like baby, by my own fears,
 or else i am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, i need, and
 shall need, all my brains to get through.
 
i had hardly come to this conclusion when i heard the great door below
 shut, and knew that the count had returned. did not come at once into
 the library, so i went cautiously to my own room and found him making
 the bed. this was odd, but only confirmed what i had all along
 thought--that there were servants in the house. when later i saw him
 through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the
 dining-room, i was assured of it; for if does himself all these
 menial offices, surely it is proof that there is one else to do them.
 this gave fright, for if there is one else in the castle, it
 must have been the count himself who was the driver of the coach that
 brought here. this is terrible thought; for if so, what does it
 mean that could control the wolves, as did, by only holding up his
 hand in silence. how was it that all the people at bistritz and on the
 coach had some terrible fear for me? what meant the giving of the
 crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? bless
 that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a
 comfort and strength to whenever i touch it. it is odd that thing
 which i have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous
 should in time of loneliness and trouble be of help. is it that there
 is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is medium,
 tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? some
 time, if it may be, i must examine this matter and try to make up my
 mind about it. in the meantime i must find out all i can about count
 dracula, as it may help to understand. to-night may talk of
 himself, if i turn the conversation that way. i must be very careful,
 however, not to awake his suspicion.
 
* * * * *
 
_midnight._--i have had long talk with the count. i asked him few
 questions on transylvania history, and warmed up to the subject
 wonderfully. in his speaking of things and people, and especially of
 battles, spoke as if had been present at them all. this he
 afterwards explained by saying that to _boyar_ the pride of his house
 and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their
 fate is his fate. whenever spoke of his house always said “we,”
 and spoke almost in the plural, like king speaking. i wish i could put
 down all said exactly as said it, for to it was most
 fascinating. it seemed to have in it whole history of the country. he
 grew excited as spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great
 white moustache and grasping anything on which laid his hands as
 though would crush it by main strength. one thing said which i
 shall put down as nearly as i can; for it tells in its way the story of
 his race:--
 
“we szekelys have right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood
 of many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. here,
 in the whirlpool of european races, the ugric tribe bore down from
 iceland the fighting spirit which thor and wodin gave them, which their
 berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of europe, ay,
 and of asia and africa too, till the peoples thought that the
 were-wolves themselves had come. here, too, when they came, they found
 the huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like living flame,
 till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those
 old witches, who, expelled from scythia had mated with the devils in the
 desert. fools, fools! what devil or what witch was ever so great as
 attila, whose blood is in these veins?” held up his arms. “is it a
 wonder that we were conquering race; that we were proud; that when the
 magyar, the lombard, the avar, the bulgar, or the turk poured his
 thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? is it strange that when
 arpad and his legions swept through the hungarian fatherland found us
 here when reached the frontier; that the honfoglalas was completed
 there? and when the hungarian flood swept eastward, the szekelys were
 claimed as kindred by the victorious magyars, and to us for centuries
 was trusted the guarding of the frontier of turkey-land; ay, and more
 than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the turks say,
 ‘water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.’ who more gladly than we
 throughout the four nations received the ‘bloody sword,’ or at its
 warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the king? when was
 redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of cassova, when the
 flags of the wallach and the magyar went down beneath the crescent? who
 was it but one of my own race who as voivode crossed the danube and beat
 the turk on his own ground? this was dracula indeed! woe was it that
 his own unworthy brother, when had fallen, sold his people to the
 turk and brought the shame of slavery on them! was it not this dracula,
 indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in later age again and
 again brought his forces over the great river into turkey-land; who,
 when was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though had
 to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being
 slaughtered, since knew that alone could ultimately triumph! they
 said that thought only of himself. bah! what good are peasants
 without leader? where ends the war without brain and heart to
 conduct it? again, when, after the battle of mohács, we threw off the
 hungarian yoke, we of the dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for
 our spirit would not brook that we were not free. ah, young sir, the
 szekelys--and the dracula as their heart’s blood, their brains, and
 their swords--can boast record that mushroom growths like the
 hapsburgs and the romanoffs can never reach. the warlike days are over.
 blood is too precious thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and
 the glories of the great races are as tale that is told.”
 
it was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_mem._, this
 diary seems horribly like the beginning of the “arabian nights,” for
 everything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of hamlet’s
 father.)
 
* * * * *
 
_12 may._--let begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by
 books and figures, and of which there can be doubt. i must not
 confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own
 observation, or my memory of them. last evening when the count came from
 his room began by asking questions on legal matters and on the
 doing of certain kinds of business. i had spent the day wearily over
 books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the
 matters i had been examining at lincoln’s inn. there was certain
 method in the count’s inquiries, so i shall try to put them down in
 sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.
 
first, asked if man in england might have two solicitors or more. i
 told him might have dozen if wished, but that it would not be
 wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only
 one could act at time, and that to change would be certain to militate
 against his interest. seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to
 ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to
 attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case
 local help were needed in place far from the home of the banking
 solicitor. i asked him to explain more fully, so that i might not by any
 chance mislead him, so said:--
 
“i shall illustrate. your friend and mine, mr. peter hawkins, from under
 the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at exeter, which is far from
 london, buys for through your good self my place at london. good! now
 here let say frankly, lest you should think it strange that i have
 sought the services of one so far off from london instead of some one
 resident there, that my motive was that local interest might be
 served save my wish only; and as one of london residence might, perhaps,
 have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, i went thus afield to
 seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. now, suppose
 i, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to newcastle, or
 durham, or harwich, or dover, might it not be that it could with more
 ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?” i answered that
 certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had system of
 agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on
 instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing
 himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by
 him without further trouble.
 
“but,” said he, “i could be at liberty to direct myself. is it not so?”
 
“of course,” i replied; and “such is often done by men of business, who
 do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.”
 
“good!” said, and then went on to ask about the means of making
 consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of
 difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded
 against. i explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,
 and certainly left under the impression that would have made a
 wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that did not think of or
 foresee. for man who was never in the country, and who did not
 evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were
 wonderful. when had satisfied himself on these points of which had
 spoken, and i had verified all as well as i could by the books
 available, suddenly stood up and said:--
 
“have you written since your first letter to our friend mr. peter
 hawkins, or to any other?” it was with some bitterness in my heart that
 i answered that i had not, that as yet i had not seen any opportunity of
 sending letters to anybody.
 
“then write now, my young friend,” said, laying heavy hand on my
 shoulder: “write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will
 please you, that you shall stay with until month from now.”
 
“do you wish to stay so long?” i asked, for my heart grew cold at the
 thought.
 
“i desire it much; nay, i will take refusal. when your master,
 employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,
 it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. i have not
 stinted. is it not so?”
 
what could i do but bow acceptance? it was mr. hawkins’s interest, not
 mine, and i had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while count
 dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing
 which made remember that i was prisoner, and that if i wished it i
 could have choice. the count saw his victory in my bow, and his
 mastery in the trouble of my face, for began at once to use them, but
 in his own smooth, resistless way:--
 
“i pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things
 other than business in your letters. it will doubtless please your
 friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting
 home to them. is it not so?” as spoke handed three sheets of
 note-paper and three envelopes. they were all of the thinnest foreign
 post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,
 with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, i understood
 as well as if had spoken that i should be careful what i wrote, for
 would be able to read it. so i determined to write only formal notes
 now, but to write fully to mr. hawkins in secret, and also to mina, for
 to her i could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the count, if he
 did see it. when i had written my two letters i sat quiet, reading a
 book whilst the count wrote several notes, referring as wrote them to
 some books on his table. then took up my two and placed them with his
 own, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door
 had closed behind him, i leaned over and looked at the letters, which
 were face down on the table. i felt compunction in doing so, for
 under the circumstances i felt that i should protect myself in every way
 i could.
 
one of the letters was directed to samuel f. billington, no. 7, the
 crescent, whitby, another to herr leutner, varna; the third was to
 coutts & co., london, and the fourth to herren klopstock & billreuth,
 bankers, buda-pesth. the second and fourth were unsealed. i was just
 about to look at them when i saw the door-handle move. i sank back in my
 seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and
 to resume my book before the count, holding still another letter in his
 hand, entered the room. took up the letters on the table and stamped
 them carefully, and then turning to me, said:--
 
“i trust you will forgive me, but i have much work to do in private this
 evening. you will, i hope, find all things as you wish.” at the door he
 turned, and after moment’s pause said:--
 
“let advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let warn you with all
 seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any
 chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. it is old, and has
 many memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. be
 warned! should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then
 haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be
 safe. but if you be not careful in this respect, then”--he finished his
 speech in gruesome way, for motioned with his hands as if were
 washing them. i quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any
 dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom
 and mystery which seemed closing around me.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--i endorse the last words written, but this time there is no
 doubt in question. i shall not fear to sleep in any place where is
 not. i have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--i imagine that
 my rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.
 
when left i went to my room. after little while, not hearing any
 sound, i came out and went up the stone stair to where i could look out
 towards the south. there was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,
 inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness
 of the courtyard. looking out on this, i felt that i was indeed in
 prison, and i seemed to want breath of fresh air, though it were of
 the night. i am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.
 it is destroying my nerve. i start at my own shadow, and am full of all
 sorts of horrible imaginings. god knows that there is ground for my
 terrible fear in this accursed place! i looked out over the beautiful
 expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as
 day. in the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows
 in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. the mere beauty seemed
 to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath i drew. as i
 leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving storey
 below me, and somewhat to my left, where i imagined, from the order of
 the rooms, that the windows of the count’s own room would look out. the
 window at which i stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though
 weatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many day since
 the case had been there. i drew back behind the stonework, and looked
 carefully out.
 
what i saw was the count’s head coming out from the window. i did not
 see the face, but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of his
 back and arms. in any case i could not mistake the hands which i had had
 so many opportunities of studying. i was at first interested and
 somewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small matter will interest
 and amuse man when is prisoner. but my very feelings changed to
 repulsion and terror when i saw the whole man slowly emerge from the
 window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,
 _face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. at
 first i could not believe my eyes. i thought it was some trick of the
 moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but i kept looking, and it could
 be delusion. i saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the
 stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus
 using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable
 speed, just as lizard moves along wall.
 
what manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the
 semblance of man? i feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering
 me; i am in fear--in awful fear--and there is escape for me; i am
 encompassed about with terrors that i dare not think of....
 
* * * * *
 
_15 may._--once more have i seen the count go out in his lizard fashion.
 moved downwards in sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and good
 deal to the left. vanished into some hole or window. when his head
 had disappeared, i leaned out to try and see more, but without
 avail--the distance was too great to allow proper angle of sight. i
 knew had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to
 explore more than i had dared to do as yet. i went back to the room, and
 taking lamp, tried all the doors. they were all locked, as i had
 expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but i went down the
 stone stairs to the hall where i had entered originally. i found i could
 pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the
 door was locked, and the key was gone! that key must be in the count’s
 room; i must watch should his door be unlocked, so that i may get it and
 escape. i went on to make thorough examination of the various stairs
 and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. one or two
 small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in
 them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. at last,
 however, i found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it
 seemed to be locked, gave little under pressure. i tried it harder,
 and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came
 from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door
 rested on the floor. here was an opportunity which i might not have
 again, so i exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that
 i could enter. i was now in wing of the castle further to the right
 than the rooms i knew and storey lower down. from the windows i could
 see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the
 windows of the end room looking out both west and south. on the latter
 side, as well as to the former, there was great precipice. the castle
 was built on the corner of great rock, so that on three sides it was
 quite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or
 bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,
 impossible to position which had to be guarded, were secured. to the
 west was great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged
 mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with
 mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and
 crannies of the stone. this was evidently the portion of the castle
 occupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of
 comfort than any i had seen. the windows were curtainless, and the
 yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to
 see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over
 all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. my
 lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but i was
 glad to have it with me, for there was dread loneliness in the place
 which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. still, it was better
 than living alone in the rooms which i had come to hate from the
 presence of the count, and after trying little to school my nerves, i
 found soft quietude come over me. here i am, sitting at little oak
 table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much
 thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my
 diary in shorthand all that has happened since i closed it last. it is
 nineteenth century up-to-date with vengeance. and yet, unless my
 senses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own
 which mere “modernity” cannot kill.
 
* * * * *
 
_later: the morning of 16 may._--god preserve my sanity, for to this i
 am reduced. safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.
 whilst i live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that i may not
 go mad, if, indeed, i be not mad already. if i be sane, then surely it
 is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this
 hateful place the count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone i
 can look for safety, even though this be only whilst i can serve his
 purpose. great god! merciful god! let be calm, for out of that way
 lies madness indeed. i begin to get new lights on certain things which
 have puzzled me. up to now i never quite knew what shakespeare meant
 when made hamlet say:--
 
“my tablets! quick, my tablets!
 ’tis meet that i put it down,” etc.,
 
for now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock
 had come which must end in its undoing, i turn to my diary for repose.
 the habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.
 
the count’s mysterious warning frightened at the time; it frightens
 more now when i think of it, for in future has fearful hold upon
 me. i shall fear to doubt what may say!
 
when i had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and
 pen in my pocket i felt sleepy. the count’s warning came into my mind,
 but i took pleasure in disobeying it. the sense of sleep was upon me,
 and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. the soft
 moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave sense of freedom
 which refreshed me. i determined not to return to-night to the
 gloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat
 and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for
 their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. i drew great
 couch out of its place near the corner, so that as i lay, i could look
 at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for
 the dust, composed myself for sleep. i suppose i must have fallen
 asleep; i hope so, but i fear, for all that followed was startlingly
 real--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the
 morning, i cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.
 
i was not alone. the room was the same, unchanged in any way since i
 came into it; i could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,
 my own footsteps marked where i had disturbed the long accumulation of
 dust. in the moonlight opposite were three young women, ladies by
 their dress and manner. i thought at the time that i must be dreaming
 when i saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw
 shadow on the floor. they came close to me, and looked at for some
 time, and then whispered together. two were dark, and had high aquiline
 noses, like the count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be
 almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. the other was
 fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes
 like pale sapphires. i seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it
 in connection with some dreamy fear, but i could not recollect at the
 moment how or where. all three had brilliant white teeth that shone like
 pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. there was something
 about them that made uneasy, some longing and at the same time some
 deadly fear. i felt in my heart wicked, burning desire that they would
 kiss with those red lips. it is not good to note this down, lest some
 day it should meet mina’s eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.
 they whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a
 silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have
 come through the softness of human lips. it was like the intolerable,
 tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by cunning hand.
 the fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her
 on. one said:--
 
“go on! you are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to
 begin.” the other added:--
 
“he is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.” i lay quiet,
 looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.
 the fair girl advanced and bent over till i could feel the movement
 of her breath upon me. sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent
 the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with bitter
 underlying the sweet, bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.
 
i was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under
 the lashes. the girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply
 gloating. there was deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling
 and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips
 like an animal, till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shining
 on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp
 teeth. lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of
 my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. then she
 paused, and i could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked
 her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. then the
 skin of my throat began to tingle as one’s flesh does when the hand that
 is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. i could feel the soft,
 shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,
 and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.
 i closed my eyes in languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating
 heart.
 
but at that instant, another sensation swept through as quick as
 lightning. i was conscious of the presence of the count, and of his
 being as if lapped in storm of fury. as my eyes opened involuntarily i
 saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with
 giant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the
 white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with
 passion. but the count! never did i imagine such wrath and fury, even to
 the demons of the pit. his eyes were positively blazing. the red light
 in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. his
 face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;
 the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like heaving bar
 of white-hot metal. with fierce sweep of his arm, hurled the woman
 from him, and then motioned to the others, as though were beating
 them back; it was the same imperious gesture that i had seen used to the
 wolves. in voice which, though low and almost in whisper seemed to
 cut through the air and then ring round the room said:--
 
“how dare you touch him, any of you? how dare you cast eyes on him when
 i had forbidden it? back, i tell you all! this man belongs to me! beware
 how you meddle with him, or you’ll have to deal with me.” the fair girl,
 with laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--
 
“you yourself never loved; you never love!” on this the other women
 joined, and such mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the
 room that it almost made faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure
 of fiends. then the count turned, after looking at my face attentively,
 and said in soft whisper:--
 
“yes, i too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. is it
 not so? well, now i promise you that when i am done with him you shall
 kiss him at your will. now go! go! i must awaken him, for there is work
 to be done.”
 
“are we to have nothing to-night?” said one of them, with low laugh,
 as she pointed to the bag which had thrown upon the floor, and which
 moved as though there were some living thing within it. for answer he
 nodded his head. one of the women jumped forward and opened it. if my
 ears did not deceive there was gasp and low wail, as of a
 half-smothered child. the women closed round, whilst i was aghast with
 horror; but as i looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful
 bag. there was door near them, and they could not have passed me
 without my noticing. they simply seemed to fade into the rays of the
 moonlight and pass out through the window, for i could see outside the
 dim, shadowy forms for moment before they entirely faded away.
 
then the horror overcame me, and i sank down unconscious.
 



chapter iv
 
jonathan harker’s journal--_continued_
 

i awoke in my own bed. if it be that i had not dreamt, the count must
 have carried here. i tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but
 could not arrive at any unquestionable result. to be sure, there were
 certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by
 in manner which was not my habit. my watch was still unwound, and i am
 rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and
 many such details. but these things are proof, for they may have been
 evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or
 another, i had certainly been much upset. i must watch for proof. of one
 thing i am glad: if it was that the count carried here and undressed
 me, must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. i
 am sure this diary would have been mystery to him which would not
 have brooked. would have taken or destroyed it. as i look round this
 room, although it has been to so full of fear, it is now sort of
 sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who
 were--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.
 
* * * * *
 
_18 may._--i have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for
 i _must_ know the truth. when i got to the doorway at the top of the
 stairs i found it closed. it had been so forcibly driven against the
 jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. i could see that the bolt
 of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.
 i fear it was dream, and must act on this surmise.
 
* * * * *
 
_19 may._--i am surely in the toils. last night the count asked in
 the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here
 was nearly done, and that i should start for home within few days,
 another that i was starting on the next morning from the time of the
 letter, and the third that i had left the castle and arrived at
 bistritz. i would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state
 of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the count whilst i
 am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his
 suspicion and to arouse his anger. knows that i know too much, and
 that i must not live, lest i be dangerous to him; my only chance is to
 prolong my opportunities. something may occur which will give a
 chance to escape. i saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath
 which was manifest when hurled that fair woman from him. explained
 to that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would
 ensure ease of mind to my friends; and assured with so much
 impressiveness that would countermand the later letters, which would
 be held over at bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my
 prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new
 suspicion. i therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked
 him what dates i should put on the letters. calculated minute, and
 then said:--
 
“the first should be june 12, the second june 19, and the third june
 29.”
 
i know now the span of my life. god help me!
 
* * * * *
 
_28 may._--there is chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to
 send word home. band of szgany have come to the castle, and are
 encamped in the courtyard. these szgany are gipsies; i have notes of
 them in my book. they are peculiar to this part of the world, though
 allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. there are thousands
 of them in hungary and transylvania, who are almost outside all law.
 they attach themselves as rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and
 call themselves by his name. they are fearless and without religion,
 save superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the romany
 tongue.
 
i shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them
 posted. i have already spoken them through my window to begin
 acquaintanceship. they took their hats off and made obeisance and many
 signs, which, however, i could not understand any more than i could
 their spoken language....
 
* * * * *
 
i have written the letters. mina’s is in shorthand, and i simply ask mr.
 hawkins to communicate with her. to her i have explained my situation,
 but without the horrors which i may only surmise. it would shock and
 frighten her to death were i to expose my heart to her. should the
 letters not carry, then the count shall not yet know my secret or the
 extent of my knowledge....
 
* * * * *
 
i have given the letters; i threw them through the bars of my window
 with gold piece, and made what signs i could to have them posted. the
 man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them
 in his cap. i could do more. i stole back to the study, and began to
 read. as the count did not come in, i have written here....
 
* * * * *
 
the count has come. sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest
 voice as opened two letters:--
 
“the szgany has given these, of which, though i know not whence they
 come, i shall, of course, take care. see!”--he must have looked at
 it--“one is from you, and to my friend peter hawkins; the other”--here
 caught sight of the strange symbols as opened the envelope, and
 the dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--“the
 other is vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! it is
 not signed. well! so it cannot matter to us.” and calmly held letter
 and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. then he
 went on:--
 
“the letter to hawkins--that i shall, of course, send on, since it is
 yours. your letters are sacred to me. your pardon, my friend, that
 unknowingly i did break the seal. will you not cover it again?” held
 out the letter to me, and with courteous bow handed clean
 envelope. i could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. when
 went out of the room i could hear the key turn softly. minute later
 i went over and tried it, and the door was locked.
 
when, an hour or two after, the count came quietly into the room, his
 coming awakened me, for i had gone to sleep on the sofa. was very
 courteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that i had been
 sleeping, said:--
 
“so, my friend, you are tired? get to bed. there is the surest rest. i
 may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours
 to me; but you will sleep, i pray.” i passed to my room and went to bed,
 and, strange to say, slept without dreaming. despair has its own calms.
 
* * * * *
 
_31 may._--this morning when i woke i thought i would provide myself
 with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so
 that i might write in case i should get an opportunity, but again a
 surprise, again shock!
 
every scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,
 relating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that
 might be useful to were i once outside the castle. i sat and pondered
 awhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and i made search of my
 portmanteau and in the wardrobe where i had placed my clothes.
 
the suit in which i had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and
 rug; i could find trace of them anywhere. this looked like some new
 scheme of villainy....
 
* * * * *
 
_17 june._--this morning, as i was sitting on the edge of my bed
 cudgelling my brains, i heard without cracking of whips and pounding
 and scraping of horses’ feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.
 with joy i hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great
 leiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of
 each pair slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty
 sheepskin, and high boots. they had also their long staves in hand. i
 ran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the
 main hall, as i thought that way might be opened for them. again a
 shock: my door was fastened on the outside.
 
then i ran to the window and cried to them. they looked up at me
 stupidly and pointed, but just then the “hetman” of the szgany came out,
 and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they
 laughed. henceforth effort of mine, piteous cry or agonised
 entreaty, would make them even look at me. they resolutely turned away.
 the leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick
 rope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the slovaks
 handled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. when
 they were all unloaded and packed in great heap in one corner of the
 yard, the slovaks were given some money by the szgany, and spitting on
 it for luck, lazily went each to his horse’s head. shortly afterwards, i
 heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.

_24 june, before morning._--last night the count left early, and
 locked himself into his own room. as soon as i dared i ran up the
 winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. i
 thought i would watch for the count, for there is something going on.
 the szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of
 some kind. i know it, for now and then i hear far-away muffled sound
 as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some
 ruthless villainy.
 
i had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when i saw
 something coming out of the count’s window. i drew back and watched
 carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. it was new shock to to
 find that had on the suit of clothes which i had worn whilst
 travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which i
 had seen the women take away. there could be doubt as to his quest,
 and in my garb, too! this, then, is his new scheme of evil: that will
 allow others to see me, as they think, so that may both leave
 evidence that i have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own
 letters, and that any wickedness which may do shall by the local
 people be attributed to me.
 
it makes rage to think that this can go on, and whilst i am shut up
 here, veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which
 is even criminal’s right and consolation.
 
i thought i would watch for the count’s return, and for long time sat
 doggedly at the window. then i began to notice that there were some
 quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. they were
 like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in
 clusters in nebulous sort of way. i watched them with sense of
 soothing, and sort of calm stole over me. i leaned back in the
 embrasure in more comfortable position, so that i could enjoy more
 fully the aërial gambolling.
 
something made start up, low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far
 below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. louder it seemed to
 ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to
 the sound as they danced in the moonlight. i felt myself struggling to
 awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,
 and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. i
 was becoming hypnotised! quicker and quicker danced the dust; the
 moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by into the mass of gloom
 beyond. more and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom
 shapes. and then i started, broad awake and in full possession of my
 senses, and ran screaming from the place. the phantom shapes, which were
 becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the
 three ghostly women to whom i was doomed. i fled, and felt somewhat
 safer in my own room, where there was moonlight and where the lamp
 was burning brightly.
 
when couple of hours had passed i heard something stirring in the
 count’s room, something like sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then
 there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. with a
 beating heart, i tried the door; but i was locked in my prison, and
 could do nothing. i sat down and simply cried.
 
as i sat i heard sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a
 woman. i rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between
 the bars. there, indeed, was woman with dishevelled hair, holding her
 hands over her heart as one distressed with running. she was leaning
 against corner of the gateway. when she saw my face at the window she
 threw herself forward, and shouted in voice laden with menace:--
 
“monster, give my child!”
 
she threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same
 words in tones which wrung my heart. then she tore her hair and beat her
 breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant
 emotion. finally, she threw herself forward, and, though i could not see
 her, i could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.
 
somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, i heard the voice of the
 count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. his call seemed to be
 answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. before many minutes
 had passed pack of them poured, like pent-up dam when liberated,
 through the wide entrance into the courtyard.
 
there was cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but
 short. before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.
 
i could not pity her, for i knew now what had become of her child, and
 she was better dead.
 
what shall i do? what can i do? how can i escape from this dreadful
 thing of night and gloom and fear?
 
* * * * *
 
_25 june, morning._--no man knows till has suffered from the night
 how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. when the
 sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great
 gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me
 as if the dove from the ark had lighted there. my fear fell from as
 if it had been vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. i must
 take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. last
 night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal
 series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the
 earth.
 
let not think of it. action!
 
it has always been at night-time that i have been molested or
 threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. i have not yet seen the
 count in the daylight. can it be that sleeps when others wake, that
 may be awake whilst they sleep? if i could only get into his room!
 but there is possible way. the door is always locked, way for me.
 
yes, there is way, if one dares to take it. where his body has gone
 why may not another body go? i have seen him myself crawl from his
 window. why should not i imitate him, and go in by his window? the
 chances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. i shall risk
 it. at the worst it can only be death; and man’s death is not a
 calf’s, and the dreaded hereafter may still be open to me. god help me
 in my task! good-bye, mina, if i fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and
 second father; good-bye, all, and last of all mina!
 
* * * * *
 
_same day, later._--i have made the effort, and god, helping me, have
 come safely back to this room. i must put down every detail in order. i
 went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south
 side, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs
 around the building on this side. the stones are big and roughly cut,
 and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. i
 took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. i looked down
 once, so as to make sure that sudden glimpse of the awful depth would
 not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. i knew pretty
 well the direction and distance of the count’s window, and made for it
 as well as i could, having regard to the opportunities available. i did
 not feel dizzy--i suppose i was too excited--and the time seemed
 ridiculously short till i found myself standing on the window-sill and
 trying to raise up the sash. i was filled with agitation, however, when
 i bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. then i looked
 around for the count, but, with surprise and gladness, made discovery.
 the room was empty! it was barely furnished with odd things, which
 seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same
 style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. i looked
 for the key, but it was not in the lock, and i could not find it
 anywhere. the only thing i found was great heap of gold in one
 corner--gold of all kinds, roman, and british, and austrian, and
 hungarian, and greek and turkish money, covered with film of dust, as
 though it had lain long in the ground. none of it that i noticed was
 less than three hundred years old. there were also chains and ornaments,
 some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.
 
at one corner of the room was heavy door. i tried it, for, since i
 could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which
 was the main object of my search, i must make further examination, or
 all my efforts would be in vain. it was open, and led through stone
 passage to circular stairway, which went steeply down. i descended,
 minding carefully where i went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit
 by loopholes in the heavy masonry. at the bottom there was dark,
 tunnel-like passage, through which came deathly, sickly odour, the
 odour of old earth newly turned. as i went through the passage the smell
 grew closer and heavier. at last i pulled open heavy door which stood
 ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently
 been used as graveyard. the roof was broken, and in two places were
 steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and
 the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been
 brought by the slovaks. there was nobody about, and i made search for
 any further outlet, but there was none. then i went over every inch of
 the ground, so as not to lose chance. i went down even into the
 vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was dread to
 my very soul. into two of these i went, but saw nothing except fragments
 of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, i made a
 discovery.
 
there, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a
 pile of newly dug earth, lay the count! was either dead or asleep, i
 could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the
 glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all
 their pallor; the lips were as red as ever. but there was sign of
 movement, pulse, breath, beating of the heart. i bent over him,
 and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. could not have lain
 there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in few hours.
 by the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.
 i thought might have the keys on him, but when i went to search i saw
 the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such look of hate,
 though unconscious of or my presence, that i fled from the place, and
 leaving the count’s room by the window, crawled again up the castle
 wall. regaining my room, i threw myself panting upon the bed and tried
 to think....
 
* * * * *
 
_29 june._--to-day is the date of my last letter, and the count has
 taken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again i saw him leave the
 castle by the same window, and in my clothes. as went down the wall,
 lizard fashion, i wished i had gun or some lethal weapon, that i might
 destroy him; but i fear that weapon wrought alone by man’s hand would
 have any effect on him. i dared not wait to see him return, for i feared
 to see those weird sisters. i came back to the library, and read there
 till i fell asleep.
 
i was awakened by the count, who looked at as grimly as man can
 look as said:--
 
“to-morrow, my friend, we must part. you return to your beautiful
 england, i to some work which may have such an end that we may never
 meet. your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow i shall not be
 here, but all shall be ready for your journey. in the morning come the
 szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some
 slovaks. when they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall
 bear you to the borgo pass to meet the diligence from bukovina to
 bistritz. but i am in hopes that i shall see more of you at castle
 dracula.” i suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.
 sincerity! it seems like profanation of the word to write it in
 connection with such monster, so asked him point-blank:--
 
“why may i not go to-night?”
 
“because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on mission.”
 
“but i would walk with pleasure. i want to get away at once.” smiled,
 such soft, smooth, diabolical smile that i knew there was some trick
 behind his smoothness. said:--
 
“and your baggage?”
 
“i do not care about it. i can send for it some other time.”
 
the count stood up, and said, with sweet courtesy which made rub my
 eyes, it seemed so real:--
 
“you english have saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is
 that which rules our _boyars_: ‘welcome the coming; speed the parting
 guest.’ come with me, my dear young friend. not an hour shall you wait
 in my house against your will, though sad am i at your going, and that
 you so suddenly desire it. come!” with stately gravity, he, with the
 lamp, preceded down the stairs and along the hall. suddenly he
 stopped.
 
“hark!”
 
close at hand came the howling of many wolves. it was almost as if the
 sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of great
 orchestra seems to leap under the bâton of the conductor. after pause
 of moment, proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back
 the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it
 open.
 
to my intense astonishment i saw that it was unlocked. suspiciously, i
 looked all round, but could see key of any kind.
 
as the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder
 and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed
 feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. i knew then that
 to struggle at the moment against the count was useless. with such
 allies as these at his command, i could do nothing. but still the door
 continued slowly to open, and only the count’s body stood in the gap.
 suddenly it struck that this might be the moment and means of my
 doom; i was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. there
 was diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the count, and
 as last chance i cried out:--
 
“shut the door; i shall wait till morning!” and covered my face with my
 hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. with one sweep of his
 powerful arm, the count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged
 and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.
 
in silence we returned to the library, and after minute or two i went
 to my own room. the last i saw of count dracula was his kissing his hand
 to me; with red light of triumph in his eyes, and with smile that
 judas in hell might be proud of.
 
when i was in my room and about to lie down, i thought i heard a
 whispering at my door. i went to it softly and listened. unless my ears
 deceived me, i heard the voice of the count:--
 
“back, back, to your own place! your time is not yet come. wait! have
 patience! to-night is mine. to-morrow night is yours!” there was low,
 sweet ripple of laughter, and in rage i threw open the door, and saw
 without the three terrible women licking their lips. as i appeared they
 all joined in horrible laugh, and ran away.
 
i came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. it is then so near
 the end? to-morrow! to-morrow! lord, help me, and those to whom i am
 dear!
 
* * * * *
 
_30 june, morning._--these may be the last words i ever write in this
 diary. i slept till just before the dawn, and when i woke threw myself
 on my knees, for i determined that if death came should find me
 ready.
 
at last i felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning
 had come. then came the welcome cock-crow, and i felt that i was safe.
 with glad heart, i opened my door and ran down to the hall. i had seen
 that the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. with hands
 that trembled with eagerness, i unhooked the chains and drew back the
 massive bolts.
 
but the door would not move. despair seized me. i pulled, and pulled, at
 the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its
 casement. i could see the bolt shot. it had been locked after i left the
 count.
 
then wild desire took to obtain that key at any risk, and i
 determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the count’s
 room. might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of
 evils. without pause i rushed up to the east window, and scrambled
 down the wall, as before, into the count’s room. it was empty, but that
 was as i expected. i could not see key anywhere, but the heap of gold
 remained. i went through the door in the corner and down the winding
 stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. i knew now well
 enough where to find the monster i sought.
 
the great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid
 was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their
 places to be hammered home. i knew i must reach the body for the key, so
 i raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then i saw
 something which filled my very soul with horror. there lay the count,
 but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair
 and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,
 and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than
 ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the
 corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. even the deep,
 burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches
 underneath were bloated. it seemed as if the whole awful creature were
 simply gorged with blood. lay like filthy leech, exhausted with his
 repletion. i shuddered as i bent over to touch him, and every sense in
 revolted at the contact; but i had to search, or i was lost. the
 coming night might see my own body banquet in similar way to those
 horrid three. i felt all over the body, but sign could i find of the
 key. then i stopped and looked at the count. there was mocking smile
 on the bloated face which seemed to drive mad. this was the being i
 was helping to transfer to london, where, perhaps, for centuries to come
 might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and
 create new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the
 helpless. the very thought drove mad. terrible desire came upon me
 to rid the world of such monster. there was lethal weapon at hand,
 but i seized shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the
 cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the
 hateful face. but as i did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full
 upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. the sight seemed to
 paralyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,
 merely making deep gash above the forehead. the shovel fell from my
 hand across the box, and as i pulled it away the flange of the blade
 caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid
 thing from my sight. the last glimpse i had was of the bloated face,
 blood-stained and fixed with grin of malice which would have held its
 own in the nethermost hell.
 
i thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed
 on fire, and i waited with despairing feeling growing over me. as i
 waited i heard in the distance gipsy song sung by merry voices coming
 closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the
 cracking of whips; the szgany and the slovaks of whom the count had
 spoken were coming. with last look around and at the box which
 contained the vile body, i ran from the place and gained the count’s
 room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.
 with strained ears, i listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the
 key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. there must
 have been some other means of entry, or some one had key for one of
 the locked doors. then there came the sound of many feet tramping and
 dying away in some passage which sent up clanging echo. i turned to
 run down again towards the vault, where i might find the new entrance;
 but at the moment there seemed to come violent puff of wind, and the
 door to the winding stair blew to with shock that set the dust from
 the lintels flying. when i ran to push it open, i found that it was
 hopelessly fast. i was again prisoner, and the net of doom was closing
 round more closely.
 
as i write there is in the passage below sound of many tramping feet
 and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,
 with their freight of earth. there is sound of hammering; it is the
 box being nailed down. now i can hear the heavy feet tramping again
 along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.
 
the door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is grinding of the key
 in the lock; i can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and
 shuts; i hear the creaking of lock and bolt.
 
hark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,
 the crack of whips, and the chorus of the szgany as they pass into the
 distance.
 
i am alone in the castle with those awful women. faugh! mina is woman,
 and there is nought in common. they are devils of the pit!
 
i shall not remain alone with them; i shall try to scale the castle wall
 farther than i have yet attempted. i shall take some of the gold with
 me, lest i want it later. i may find way from this dreadful place.
 
and then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away
 from this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his
 children still walk with earthly feet!
 
at least god’s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the
 precipice is steep and high. at its foot man may sleep--as man.
 good-bye, all! mina!
 



chapter v
 
_letter from miss mina murray to miss lucy westenra._
 

“_9 may._
 
“my dearest lucy,--
 
“forgive my long delay in writing, but i have been simply overwhelmed
 with work. the life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.
 i am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together
 freely and build our castles in the air. i have been working very hard
 lately, because i want to keep up with jonathan’s studies, and i have
 been practising shorthand very assiduously. when we are married i shall
 be able to be useful to jonathan, and if i can stenograph well enough i
 can take down what wants to say in this way and write it out for
 him on the typewriter, at which also i am practising very hard. he
 and i sometimes write letters in shorthand, and is keeping a
 stenographic journal of his travels abroad. when i am with you i
 shall keep diary in the same way. i don’t mean one of those
 two-pages-to-the-week-with-sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a
 sort of journal which i can write in whenever i feel inclined. i do not
 suppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not
 intended for them. i may show it to jonathan some day if there is in it
 anything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. i shall try
 to do what i see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing
 descriptions and trying to remember conversations. i am told that, with
 little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears
 said during day. however, we shall see. i will tell you of my little
 plans when we meet. i have just had few hurried lines from jonathan
 from transylvania. is well, and will be returning in about week. i
 am longing to hear all his news. it must be so nice to see strange
 countries. i wonder if we--i mean jonathan and i--shall ever see them
 together. there is the ten o’clock bell ringing. good-bye.
 
“your loving
 
“mina.
 
“tell all the news when you write. you have not told anything for
 long time. i hear rumours, and especially of tall, handsome,
 curly-haired man???”
 

_letter, lucy westenra to mina murray_.
 
“_17, chatham street_,
 
“_wednesday_.
 
“my dearest mina,--
 
“i must say you tax _very_ unfairly with being bad correspondent. i
 wrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your
 _second_. besides, i have nothing to tell you. there is really nothing
 to interest you. town is very pleasant just now, and we go good deal
 to picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. as to the
 tall, curly-haired man, i suppose it was the one who was with at the
 last pop. some one has evidently been telling tales. that was mr.
 holmwood. often comes to see us, and and mamma get on very well
 together; they have so many things to talk about in common. we met some
 time ago man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already
 engaged to jonathan. is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well
 off, and of good birth. is doctor and really clever. just fancy! he
 is only nine-and-twenty, and has an immense lunatic asylum all under
 his own care. mr. holmwood introduced him to me, and called here to
 see us, and often comes now. i think is one of the most resolute men
 i ever saw, and yet the most calm. seems absolutely imperturbable. i
 can fancy what wonderful power must have over his patients. has
 curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to
 read one’s thoughts. tries this on very much with me, but i flatter
 myself has got tough nut to crack. i know that from my glass. do
 you ever try to read your own face? _i do_, and i can tell you it is not
 bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you
 have never tried it. says that i afford him curious psychological
 study, and i humbly think i do. i do not, as you know, take sufficient
 interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. dress is a
 bore. that is slang again, but never mind; arthur says that every day.
 there, it is all out. mina, we have told all our secrets to each other
 since we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and
 laughed and cried together; and now, though i have spoken, i would like
 to speak more. oh, mina, couldn’t you guess? i love him. i am blushing
 as i write, for although i _think_ loves me, has not told so in
 words. but oh, mina, i love him; i love him; i love him! there, that
 does good. i wish i were with you, dear, sitting by the fire
 undressing, as we used to sit; and i would try to tell you what i feel.
 i do not know how i am writing this even to you. i am afraid to stop,
 or i should tear up the letter, and i don’t want to stop, for i _do_ so
 want to tell you all. let hear from you _at once_, and tell all
 that you think about it. mina, i must stop. good-night. bless in your
 prayers; and, mina, pray for my happiness.
 
“lucy.
 
“p.s.--i need not tell you this is secret. good-night again.
 
“l.”
 
_letter, lucy westenra to mina murray_.
 
“_24 may_.
 
“my dearest mina,--
 
“thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. it was so
 nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.
 
“my dear, it never rains but it pours. how true the old proverbs are.
 here am i, who shall be twenty in september, and yet i never had a
 proposal till to-day, not real proposal, and to-day i have had three.
 just fancy! three proposals in one day! isn’t it awful! i feel sorry,
 really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. oh, mina, i am so
 happy that i don’t know what to do with myself. and three proposals!
 but, for goodness’ sake, don’t tell any of the girls, or they would be
 getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured
 and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at
 least. some girls are so vain! you and i, mina dear, who are engaged and
 are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can
 despise vanity. well, i must tell you about the three, but you must keep
 it secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, jonathan. you
 will tell him, because i would, if i were in your place, certainly tell
 arthur. woman ought to tell her husband everything--don’t you think
 so, dear?--and i must be fair. men like women, certainly their wives, to
 be quite as fair as they are; and women, i am afraid, are not always
 quite as fair as they should be. well, my dear, number one came just
 before lunch. i told you of him, dr. john seward, the lunatic-asylum
 man, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. was very cool
 outwardly, but was nervous all the same. had evidently been schooling
 himself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he
 almost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don’t generally do
 when they are cool, and then when wanted to appear at ease kept
 playing with lancet in way that made nearly scream. spoke to
 me, mina, very straightforwardly. told how dear i was to him,
 though had known so little, and what his life would be with to
 help and cheer him. was going to tell how unhappy would be if i
 did not care for him, but when saw cry said that was brute
 and would not add to my present trouble. then broke off and asked if
 i could love him in time; and when i shook my head his hands trembled,
 and then with some hesitation asked if i cared already for any one
 else. put it very nicely, saying that did not want to wring my
 confidence from me, but only to know, because if woman’s heart was
 free man might have hope. and then, mina, i felt sort of duty to
 tell him that there was some one. i only told him that much, and then he
 stood up, and looked very strong and very grave as took both my
 hands in his and said hoped i would be happy, and that if i ever
 wanted friend i must count him one of my best. oh, mina dear, i can’t
 help crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. being
 proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn’t at
 all happy thing when you have to see poor fellow, whom you know
 loves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to
 know that, matter what may say at the moment, you are passing
 quite out of his life. my dear, i must stop here at present, i feel so
 miserable, though i am so happy.
 
“_evening._
 
“arthur has just gone, and i feel in better spirits than when i left
 off, so i can go on telling you about the day. well, my dear, number two
 came after lunch. is such nice fellow, an american from texas, and
 looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he
 has been to so many places and has had such adventures. i sympathise
 with poor desdemona when she had such dangerous stream poured in her
 ear, even by black man. i suppose that we women are such cowards that
 we think man will save us from fears, and we marry him. i know now
 what i would do if i were man and wanted to make girl love me. no, i
 don’t, for there was mr. morris telling us his stories, and arthur never
 told any, and yet---- my dear, i am somewhat previous. mr. quincey p.
 morris found alone. it seems that man always does find girl
 alone. no, doesn’t, for arthur tried twice to _make_ chance, and i
 helping him all i could; i am not ashamed to say it now. i must tell you
 beforehand that mr. morris doesn’t always speak slang--that is to say,
 never does so to strangers or before them, for is really well
 educated and has exquisite manners--but found out that it amused me
 to hear him talk american slang, and whenever i was present, and there
 was one to be shocked, said such funny things. i am afraid, my
 dear, has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he
 has to say. but this is way slang has. i do not know myself if i shall
 ever speak slang; i do not know if arthur likes it, as i have never
 heard him use any as yet. well, mr. morris sat down beside and looked
 as happy and jolly as could, but i could see all the same that was
 very nervous. took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--
 
“‘miss lucy, i know i ain’t good enough to regulate the fixin’s of your
 little shoes, but i guess if you wait till you find man that is you
 will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. won’t
 you just hitch up alongside of and let us go down the long road
 together, driving in double harness?’
 
“well, did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn’t seem
 half so hard to refuse him as it did poor dr. seward; so i said, as
 lightly as i could, that i did not know anything of hitching, and that i
 wasn’t broken to harness at all yet. then said that had spoken in
 light manner, and hoped that if had made mistake in doing so
 on so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, i would forgive him. he
 really did look serious when was saying it, and i couldn’t help
 feeling bit serious too--i know, mina, you will think horrid
 flirt--though i couldn’t help feeling sort of exultation that was
 number two in one day. and then, my dear, before i could say word he
 began pouring out perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very
 heart and soul at my feet. looked so earnest over it that i shall
 never again think that man must be playful always, and never earnest,
 because is merry at times. i suppose saw something in my face
 which checked him, for suddenly stopped, and said with sort of
 manly fervour that i could have loved him for if i had been free:--
 
“‘lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, i know. i should not be here
 speaking to you as i am now if i did not believe you clean grit, right
 through to the very depths of your soul. tell me, like one good fellow
 to another, is there any one else that you care for? and if there is
 i’ll never trouble you hair’s breadth again, but will be, if you will
 let me, very faithful friend.’
 
“my dear mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy
 of them? here was i almost making fun of this great-hearted, true
 gentleman. i burst into tears--i am afraid, my dear, you will think
 this very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and i really felt very
 badly. why can’t they let girl marry three men, or as many as want
 her, and save all this trouble? but this is heresy, and i must not say
 it. i am glad to say that, though i was crying, i was able to look into
 mr. morris’s brave eyes, and i told him out straight:--
 
“‘yes, there is some one i love, though has not told yet that he
 even loves me.’ i was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a
 light came into his face, and put out both his hands and took mine--i
 think i put them into his--and said in hearty way:--
 
“‘that’s my brave girl. it’s better worth being late for chance of
 winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. don’t
 cry, my dear. if it’s for me, i’m hard nut to crack; and i take it
 standing up. if that other fellow doesn’t know his happiness, well, he’d
 better look for it soon, or he’ll have to deal with me. little girl,
 your honesty and pluck have made friend, and that’s rarer than a
 lover; it’s more unselfish anyhow. my dear, i’m going to have pretty
 lonely walk between this and kingdom come. won’t you give one kiss?
 it’ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. you can, you
 know, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be good fellow,
 my dear, and fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn’t spoken
 yet.’ that quite won me, mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and
 noble, too, to rival--wasn’t it?--and so sad; so i leant over and
 kissed him. stood up with my two hands in his, and as looked down
 into my face--i am afraid i was blushing very much--he said:--
 
“‘little girl, i hold your hand, and you’ve kissed me, and if these
 things don’t make us friends nothing ever will. thank you for your sweet
 honesty to me, and good-bye.’ wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,
 went straight out of the room without looking back, without tear or a
 quiver or pause; and i am crying like baby. oh, why must man like
 that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would
 worship the very ground trod on? i know i would if i were free--only
 i don’t want to be free. my dear, this quite upset me, and i feel i
 cannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and i
 don’t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.
 
“ever your loving
 
“lucy.
 
“p.s.--oh, about number three--i needn’t tell you of number three, need
 i? besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only moment from his
 coming into the room till both his arms were round me, and was
 kissing me. i am very, very happy, and i don’t know what i have done to
 deserve it. i must only try in the future to show that i am not
 ungrateful to god for all his goodness to in sending to such a
 lover, such husband, and such friend.
 
“good-bye.”

(kept in phonograph)
 
_25 may._--ebb tide in appetite to-day. cannot eat, cannot rest, so
 diary instead. since my rebuff of yesterday i have sort of empty
 feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth
 the doing.... as i knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was
 work, i went down amongst the patients. i picked out one who has
 afforded study of much interest. is so quaint that i am
 determined to understand him as well as i can. to-day i seemed to get
 nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.
 
i questioned him more fully than i had ever done, with view to making
 myself master of the facts of his hallucination. in my manner of doing
 it there was, i now see, something of cruelty. i seemed to wish to keep
 him to the point of his madness--a thing which i avoid with the patients
 as i would the mouth of hell.
 
(_mem._, under what circumstances would i _not_ avoid the pit of hell?)
 _omnia romæ venalia sunt._ hell has its price! _verb. sap._ if there be
 anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards
 _accurately_, so i had better commence to do so, therefore--
 
r. m. renfield, ætat 59.--sanguine temperament; great physical strength;
 morbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which i
 cannot make out. i presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the
 disturbing influence end in mentally-accomplished finish; possibly
 dangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. in selfish men caution
 is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. what i think of
 on this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is
 balanced with the centrifugal; when duty, cause, etc., is the fixed
 point, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or series of
 accidents can balance it.

chapter vi
 
mina murray’s journal
 

_24 july. whitby._--lucy met at the station, looking sweeter and
 lovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the crescent in
 which they have rooms. this is lovely place. the little river, the
 esk, runs through deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the
 harbour. great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the
 view seems somehow further away than it really is. the valley is
 beautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land
 on either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to
 see down. the houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all
 red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the
 pictures we see of nuremberg. right over the town is the ruin of whitby
 abbey, which was sacked by the danes, and which is the scene of part of
 “marmion,” where the girl was built up in the wall. it is most noble
 ruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is
 legend that white lady is seen in one of the windows. between it and
 the town there is another church, the parish one, round which is big
 graveyard, all full of tombstones. this is to my mind the nicest spot in
 whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has full view of the
 harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called kettleness
 stretches out into the sea. it descends so steeply over the harbour that
 part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been
 destroyed. in one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches
 out over the sandy pathway far below. there are walks, with seats beside
 them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long
 looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. i shall come and
 sit here very often myself and work. indeed, i am writing now, with my
 book on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are
 sitting beside me. they seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and
 talk.
 
the harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall
 stretching out into the sea, with curve outwards at the end of it, in
 the middle of which is lighthouse. heavy sea-wall runs along outside
 of it. on the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,
 and its end too has lighthouse. between the two piers there is a
 narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.
 
it is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to
 nothing, and there is merely the stream of the esk, running between
 banks of sand, with rocks here and there. outside the harbour on this
 side there rises for about half mile great reef, the sharp edge of
 which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. at the end of
 it is buoy with bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a
 mournful sound on the wind. they have legend here that when ship is
 lost bells are heard out at sea. i must ask the old man about this; he
 is coming this way....
 
is funny old man. must be awfully old, for his face is all
 gnarled and twisted like the bark of tree. tells that is
 nearly hundred, and that was sailor in the greenland fishing
 fleet when waterloo was fought. is, i am afraid, very sceptical
 person, for when i asked him about the bells at and the white lady
 at the abbey said very brusquely:--
 
“i wouldn’t fash masel’ about them, miss. them things be all wore out.
 mind, i don’t say that they never was, but i do say that they wasn’t in
 my time. they be all very well for comers and trippers, an’ the like,
 but not for nice young lady like you. them feet-folks from york and
 leeds that be always eatin’ cured herrin’s an’ drinkin’ tea an’ lookin’
 out to buy cheap jet would creed aught. i wonder masel’ who’d be
 bothered tellin’ lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of
 fool-talk.” i thought would be good person to learn interesting
 things from, so i asked him if would mind telling something about
 the whale-fishing in the old days. was just settling himself to begin
 when the clock struck six, whereupon laboured to get up, and said:--
 
“i must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. my grand-daughter doesn’t like
 to be kept waitin’ when the tea is ready, for it takes time to
 crammle aboon the grees, for there be many of ’em; an’, miss, i lack
 belly-timber sairly by the clock.”
 
hobbled away, and i could see him hurrying, as well as could, down
 the steps. the steps are great feature on the place. they lead from
 the town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--i do not know how
 many--and they wind up in delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that
 horse could easily walk up and down them. i think they must originally
 have had something to do with the abbey. i shall go home too. lucy went
 out visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, i did
 not go. they will be home by this.
 
* * * * *
 
_1 august._--i came up here an hour ago with lucy, and we had most
 interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come
 and join him. is evidently the sir oracle of them, and i should think
 must have been in his time most dictatorial person. will not admit
 anything, and downfaces everybody. if can’t out-argue them bullies
 them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. lucy
 was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a
 beautiful colour since she has been here. i noticed that the old men did
 not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.
 she is so sweet with old people; i think they all fell in love with her
 on the spot. even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but
 gave double share instead. i got him on the subject of the legends,
 and went off at once into sort of sermon. i must try to remember it
 and put it down:--
 
“it be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that’s what it be, an’
 nowt else. these bans an’ wafts an’ boh-ghosts an’ barguests an’ bogles
 an’ all anent them is only fit to set bairns an’ dizzy women
 a-belderin’. they be nowt but air-blebs. they, an’ all grims an’ signs
 an’ warnin’s, be all invented by parsons an’ illsome beuk-bodies an’
 railway touters to skeer an’ scunner hafflin’s, an’ to get folks to do
 somethin’ that they don’t other incline to. it makes ireful to think
 o’ them. why, it’s them that, not content with printin’ lies on paper
 an’ preachin’ them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin’ them on the
 tombstones. look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them
 steans, holdin’ up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,
 is acant--simply tumblin’ down with the weight o’ the lies wrote on
 them, ‘here lies the body’ or ‘sacred to the memory’ wrote on all of
 them, an’ yet in nigh half of them there bean’t bodies at all; an’
 the memories of them bean’t cared pinch of snuff about, much less
 sacred. lies all of them, nothin’ but lies of one kind or another! my
 gog, but it’ll be quare scowderment at the day of judgment when they
 come tumblin’ up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an’ tryin’ to
 drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them
 trimmlin’ and ditherin’, with their hands that dozzened an’ slippy from
 lyin’ in the that they can’t even keep their grup o’ them.”
 
i could see from the old fellow’s self-satisfied air and the way in
 which looked round for the approval of his cronies that was
 “showing off,” so i put in word to keep him going:--
 
“oh, mr. swales, you can’t be serious. surely these tombstones are not
 all wrong?”
 
“yabblins! there may be poorish few not wrong, savin’ where they make
 out the people too good; for there be folk that do think balm-bowl be
 like the sea, if only it be their own. the whole thing be only lies. now
 look you here; you come here stranger, an’ you see this kirk-garth.” i
 nodded, for i thought it better to assent, though i did not quite
 understand his dialect. i knew it had something to do with the church.
 went on: “and you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be
 happed here, snod an’ snog?” i assented again. “then that be just where
 the lie comes in. why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as
 old dun’s ’bacca-box on friday night.” nudged one of his companions,
 and they all laughed. “and my gog! how could they be otherwise? look at
 that one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!” i went over and
 read:--
 
“edward spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of
 andres, april, 1854, æt. 30.” when i came back mr. swales went on:--
 
“who brought him home, i wonder, to hap him here? murdered off the coast
 of andres! an’ you consated his body lay under! why, i could name ye a
 dozen whose bones lie in the greenland seas above”--he pointed
 northwards--“or where the currents may have drifted them. there be the
 steans around ye. ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of
 the lies from here. this braithwaite lowrey--i knew his father, lost in
 the _lively_ off greenland in ’20; or andrew woodhouse, drowned in the
 same seas in 1777; or john paxton, drowned off cape farewell year
 later; or old john rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned
 in the gulf of finland in ’50. do ye think that all these men will have
 to make rush to whitby when the trumpet sounds? i have antherums
 aboot it! i tell ye that when they got here they’d be jommlin’ an’
 jostlin’ one another that way that it ’ud be like fight up on the ice
 in the old days, when we’d be at one another from daylight to dark, an’
 tryin’ to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.” this was
 evidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his
 cronies joined in with gusto.
 
“but,” i said, “surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the
 assumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to
 take their tombstones with them on the day of judgment. do you think
 that will be really necessary?”
 
“well, what else be they tombstones for? answer that, miss!”
 
“to please their relatives, i suppose.”
 
“to please their relatives, you suppose!” this said with intense
 scorn. “how will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote
 over them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?” he
 pointed to stone at our feet which had been laid down as slab, on
 which the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. “read the
 lies on that thruff-stean,” said. the letters were upside down to me
 from where i sat, but lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over
 and read:--
 
“sacred to the memory of george canon, who died, in the hope of a
 glorious resurrection, on july, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at
 kettleness. this tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly
 beloved son. ‘he was the only of his mother, and she was widow.’
 really, mr. swales, i don’t see anything very funny in that!” she spoke
 her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.
 
“ye don’t see aught funny! ha! ha! but that’s because ye don’t gawm the
 sorrowin’ mother was hell-cat that hated him because was
 acrewk’d--a regular lamiter was--an’ hated her so that he
 committed suicide in order that she mightn’t get an insurance she put on
 his life. blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that
 they had for scarin’ the crows with. ’twarn’t for crows then, for it
 brought the clegs and the dowps to him. that’s the way fell off the
 rocks. and, as to hopes of glorious resurrection, i’ve often heard him
 say masel’ that hoped he’d go to hell, for his mother was so pious
 that she’d be sure to go to heaven, an’ didn’t want to addle where
 she was. now isn’t that stean at any rate”--he hammered it with his
 stick as spoke--“a pack of lies? and won’t it make gabriel keckle
 when geordie comes pantin’ up the grees with the tombstean balanced on
 his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!”
 
i did not know what to say, but lucy turned the conversation as she
 said, rising up:--
 
“oh, why did you tell us of this? it is my favourite seat, and i cannot
 leave it; and now i find i must go on sitting over the grave of a
 suicide.”
 
“that won’t harm ye, my pretty; an’ it may make poor geordie gladsome to
 have so trim lass sittin’ on his lap. that won’t hurt ye. why, i’ve
 sat here off an’ on for nigh twenty years past, an’ it hasn’t done me
 harm. don’t ye fash about them as lies under ye, or that doesn’ lie
 there either! it’ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the
 tombsteans all run away with, and the place as bare as stubble-field.
 there’s the clock, an’ i must gang. my service to ye, ladies!” and off
 hobbled.
 
lucy and i sat awhile, and it was all so beautiful before us that we
 took hands as we sat; and she told all over again about arthur and
 their coming marriage. that made just little heart-sick, for i
 haven’t heard from jonathan for whole month.
 
* * * * *
 
_the same day._ i came up here alone, for i am very sad. there was no
 letter for me. i hope there cannot be anything the matter with jonathan.
 the clock has just struck nine. i see the lights scattered all over the
 town, sometimes in rows where the streets are, and sometimes singly;
 they run right up the esk and die away in the curve of the valley. to my
 left the view is cut off by black line of roof of the old house next
 the abbey. the sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind
 me, and there is clatter of donkey’s hoofs up the paved road below.
 the band on the pier is playing harsh waltz in good time, and further
 along the quay there is salvation army meeting in back street.
 neither of the bands hears the other, but up here i hear and see them
 both. i wonder where jonathan is and if is thinking of me! i wish he
 were here.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_5 june._--the case of renfield grows more interesting the more i get to
 understand the man. has certain qualities very largely developed;
 selfishness, secrecy, and purpose. i wish i could get at what is the
 object of the latter. seems to have some settled scheme of his own,
 but what it is i do not yet know. his redeeming quality is love of
 animals, though, indeed, has such curious turns in it that i
 sometimes imagine is only abnormally cruel. his pets are of odd
 sorts. just now his hobby is catching flies. has at present such a
 quantity that i have had myself to expostulate. to my astonishment, he
 did not break out into fury, as i expected, but took the matter in
 simple seriousness. thought for moment, and then said: “may i have
 three days? i shall clear them away.” of course, i said that would do. i
 must watch him.
 
* * * * *
 
_18 june._--he has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several
 very big fellows in box. keeps feeding them with his flies, and
 the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he
 has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his
 room.
 
* * * * *
 
_1 july._--his spiders are now becoming as great nuisance as his
 flies, and to-day i told him that must get rid of them. looked
 very sad at this, so i said that must clear out some of them, at all
 events. cheerfully acquiesced in this, and i gave him the same time
 as before for reduction. disgusted much while with him, for when a
 horrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,
 caught it, held it exultantly for few moments between his finger
 and thumb, and, before i knew what was going to do, put it in his
 mouth and ate it. i scolded him for it, but argued quietly that it
 was very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and
 gave life to him. this gave an idea, or the rudiment of one. i must
 watch how gets rid of his spiders. has evidently some deep problem
 in his mind, for keeps little note-book in which is always
 jotting down something. whole pages of it are filled with masses of
 figures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the
 totals added in batches again, as though were “focussing” some
 account, as the auditors put it.
 
* * * * *
 
_8 july._--there is method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in
 my mind is growing. it will be whole idea soon, and then, oh,
 unconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your
 conscious brother. i kept away from my friend for few days, so that i
 might notice if there were any change. things remain as they were except
 that has parted with some of his pets and got new one. has
 managed to get sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. his means
 of taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. those that
 do remain, however, are well fed, for still brings in the flies by
 tempting them with his food.
 
* * * * *
 
_19 july._--we are progressing. my friend has now whole colony of
 sparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. when i came
 in ran to and said wanted to ask great favour--a very,
 very great favour; and as spoke fawned on like dog. i asked
 him what it was, and said, with sort of rapture in his voice and
 bearing:--
 
“a kitten, nice little, sleek playful kitten, that i can play with,
 and teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!” i was not unprepared for this
 request, for i had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and
 vivacity, but i did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows
 should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so
 i said i would see about it, and asked him if would not rather have a
 cat than kitten. his eagerness betrayed him as answered:--
 
“oh, yes, i would like cat! i only asked for kitten lest you should
 refuse cat. one would refuse kitten, would they?” i shook
 my head, and said that at present i feared it would not be possible, but
 that i would see about it. his face fell, and i could see warning of
 danger in it, for there was sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant
 killing. the man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. i shall test him
 with his present craving and see how it will work out; then i shall know
 more.
 
* * * * *
 
_10 p. m._--i have visited him again and found him sitting in corner
 brooding. when i came in threw himself on his knees before and
 implored to let him have cat; that his salvation depended upon it.
 i was firm, however, and told him that could not have it, whereupon
 went without word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner
 where i had found him. i shall see him in the morning early.
 
* * * * *
 
_20 july._--visited renfield very early, before the attendant went his
 rounds. found him up and humming tune. was spreading out his sugar,
 which had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his
 fly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with good grace. i
 looked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they
 were. replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.
 there were few feathers about the room and on his pillow drop of
 blood. i said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to if
 there were anything odd about him during the day.
 
* * * * *
 
_11 a. m._--the attendant has just been to to say that renfield has
 been very sick and has disgorged whole lot of feathers. “my belief is,
 doctor,” said, “that has eaten his birds, and that just took
 and ate them raw!”
 
* * * * *
 
_11 p. m._--i gave renfield strong opiate to-night, enough to make
 even him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. the thought
 that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory
 proved. my homicidal maniac is of peculiar kind. i shall have to
 invent new classification for him, and call him zoöphagous
 (life-eating) maniac; what desires is to absorb as many lives as he
 can, and has laid himself out to achieve it in cumulative way. he
 gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then
 wanted cat to eat the many birds. what would have been his later
 steps? it would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. it
 might be done if there were only sufficient cause. men sneered at
 vivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! why not advance science
 in its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? had
 i even the secret of one such mind--did i hold the key to the fancy of
 even one lunatic--i might advance my own branch of science to pitch
 compared with which burdon-sanderson’s physiology or ferrier’s
 brain-knowledge would be as nothing. if only there were sufficient
 cause! i must not think too much of this, or i may be tempted; good
 cause might turn the scale with me, for may not i too be of an
 exceptional brain, congenitally?
 
how well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. i
 wonder at how many lives values man, or if at only one. has
 closed the account most accurately, and to-day begun new record. how
 many of us begin new record with each day of our lives?
 
to it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,
 and that truly i began new record. so it will be until the great
 recorder sums up and closes my ledger account with balance to
 profit or loss. oh, lucy, lucy, i cannot be angry with you, nor can i be
 angry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but i must only wait on
 hopeless and work. work! work!
 
if i only could have as strong cause as my poor mad friend there--a
 good, unselfish cause to make work--that would be indeed happiness.
 

_mina murray’s journal._
 
_26 july._--i am anxious, and it soothes to express myself here; it
 is like whispering to one’s self and listening at the same time. and
 there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it
 different from writing. i am unhappy about lucy and about jonathan. i
 had not heard from jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but
 yesterday dear mr. hawkins, who is always so kind, sent letter from
 him. i had written asking him if had heard, and said the enclosed
 had just been received. it is only line dated from castle dracula,
 and says that is just starting for home. that is not like jonathan;
 i do not understand it, and it makes uneasy. then, too, lucy,
 although she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in
 her sleep. her mother has spoken to about it, and we have decided
 that i am to lock the door of our room every night. mrs. westenra has
 got an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and
 along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over
 with despairing cry that echoes all over the place. poor dear, she is
 naturally anxious about lucy, and she tells that her husband, lucy’s
 father, had the same habit; that would get up in the night and dress
 himself and go out, if were not stopped. lucy is to be married in the
 autumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is
 to be arranged. i sympathise with her, for i do the same, only jonathan
 and i will start in life in very simple way, and shall have to try to
 make both ends meet. mr. holmwood--he is the hon. arthur holmwood, only
 of lord godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as can
 leave town, for his father is not very well, and i think dear lucy is
 counting the moments till comes. she wants to take him up to the seat
 on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of whitby. i daresay it
 is the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he
 arrives.
 
* * * * *
 
_27 july._--no news from jonathan. i am getting quite uneasy about him,
 though why i should i do not know; but i do wish that would write, if
 it were only single line. lucy walks more than ever, and each night i
 am awakened by her moving about the room. fortunately, the weather is so
 hot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually
 being wakened is beginning to tell on me, and i am getting nervous and
 wakeful myself. thank god, lucy’s health keeps up. mr. holmwood has been
 suddenly called to ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously
 ill. lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch
 her looks; she is trifle stouter, and her cheeks are lovely
 rose-pink. she has lost that anæmic look which she had. i pray it will
 all last.
 
* * * * *
 
_3 august._--another week gone, and news from jonathan, not even to
 mr. hawkins, from whom i have heard. oh, i do hope is not ill. he
 surely would have written. i look at that last letter of his, but
 somehow it does not satisfy me. it does not read like him, and yet it is
 his writing. there is mistake of that. lucy has not walked much in
 her sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her
 which i do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching
 me. she tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room
 searching for the key.
 
_6 august._--another three days, and news. this suspense is getting
 dreadful. if i only knew where to write to or where to go to, i should
 feel easier; but one has heard word of jonathan since that last
 letter. i must only pray to god for patience. lucy is more excitable
 than ever, but is otherwise well. last night was very threatening, and
 the fishermen say that we are in for storm. i must try to watch it and
 learn the weather signs. to-day is grey day, and the sun as i write is
 hidden in thick clouds, high over kettleness. everything is grey--except
 the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;
 grey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the
 grey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. the sea
 is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with roar,
 muffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. the horizon is lost in grey
 mist. all is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and
 there is “brool” over the that sounds like some presage of doom.
 dark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in
 the mist, and seem “men like trees walking.” the fishing-boats are
 racing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into
 the harbour, bending to the scuppers. here comes old mr. swales. is
 making straight for me, and i can see, by the way lifts his hat, that
 wants to talk....
 
i have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. when sat
 down beside me, said in very gentle way:--
 
“i want to say something to you, miss.” i could see was not at ease,
 so i took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak
 fully; so said, leaving his hand in mine:--
 
“i’m afraid, my deary, that i must have shocked you by all the wicked
 things i’ve been sayin’ about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;
 but i didn’t mean them, and i want ye to remember that when i’m gone. we
 aud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don’t
 altogether like to think of it, and we don’t want to feel scart of it;
 an’ that’s why i’ve took to makin’ light of it, so that i’d cheer up my
 own heart bit. but, lord love ye, miss, i ain’t afraid of dyin’, not a
 bit; only i don’t want to die if i can help it. my time must be nigh at
 hand now, for i be aud, and hundred years is too much for any man to
 expect; and i’m so nigh it that the aud man is already whettin’ his
 scythe. ye see, i can’t get out o’ the habit of caffin’ about it all at
 once; the chafts will wag as they be used to. some day soon the angel of
 death will sound his trumpet for me. but don’t ye dooal an’ greet, my
 deary!”--for saw that i was crying--“if should come this very
 night i’d not refuse to answer his call. for life be, after all, only a
 waitin’ for somethin’ else than what we’re doin’; and death be all that
 we can rightly depend on. but i’m content, for it’s comin’ to me, my
 deary, and comin’ quick. it may be comin’ while we be lookin’ and
 wonderin’. maybe it’s in that wind out over the that’s bringin’ with
 it loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. look! look!” he
 cried suddenly. “there’s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont
 that sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. it’s in the
 air; i feel it comin’. lord, make answer cheerful when my call
 comes!” held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. his mouth
 moved as though were praying. after few minutes’ silence, got
 up, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled
 off. it all touched me, and upset very much.
 
i was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his
 arm. stopped to talk with me, as always does, but all the time
 kept looking at strange ship.
 
“i can’t make her out,” said; “she’s russian, by the look of her;
 but she’s knocking about in the queerest way. she doesn’t know her mind
 bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can’t decide whether to
 run up north in the open, or to put in here. look there again! she is
 steered mighty strangely, for she doesn’t mind the hand on the wheel;
 changes about with every puff of wind. we’ll hear more of her before
 this time to-morrow.”

(_pasted in mina murray’s journal._)
 
from correspondent.
 
_whitby_.
 
one of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been
 experienced here, with results both strange and unique. the weather had
 been somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of
 august. saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great
 body of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to mulgrave woods,
 robin hood’s bay, rig mill, runswick, staithes, and the various trips in
 the neighbourhood of whitby. the steamers _emma_ and _scarborough_ made
 trips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of
 “tripping” both to and from whitby. the day was unusually fine till the
 afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the east cliff
 churchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of
 visible to the north and east, called attention to sudden show of
 “mares’-tails” high in the sky to the north-west. the wind was then
 blowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical
 language is ranked “no. 2: light breeze.” the coastguard on duty at once
 made report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half century has
 kept watch on weather signs from the east cliff, foretold in an emphatic
 manner the coming of sudden storm. the approach of sunset was so very
 beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that
 there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old
 churchyard to enjoy the beauty. before the sun dipped below the black
 mass of kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its
 downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,
 purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and
 there masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all
 sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. the
 experience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the
 sketches of the “prelude to the great storm” will grace the r. a. and r.
 i. walls in may next. more than one captain made up his mind then and
 there that his “cobble” or his “mule,” as they term the different
 classes of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.
 the wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there
 was dead calm, sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on
 the approach of thunder, affects persons of sensitive nature. there
 were but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,
 which usually “hug” the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but
 few fishing-boats were in sight. the only sail noticeable was foreign
 schooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. the
 foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was prolific theme for
 comment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal
 her to reduce sail in face of her danger. before the night shut down she
 was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating
 swell of the sea,
 
“as idle as painted ship upon painted ocean.”
 
shortly before ten o’clock the stillness of the air grew quite
 oppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of sheep
 inland or the barking of dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the
 band on the pier, with its lively french air, was like discord in the
 great harmony of nature’s silence. little after midnight came a
 strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to
 carry strange, faint, hollow booming.
 
then without warning the tempest broke. with rapidity which, at the
 time, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,
 the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. the waves rose in
 growing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in very few minutes
 the lately glassy was like roaring and devouring monster.
 white-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the
 shelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept
 the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier
 of whitby harbour. the wind roared like thunder, and blew with such
 force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,
 or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. it was found necessary
 to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the
 fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. to add to
 the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came
 drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,
 so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of
 imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at were
 touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many
 one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. at times the mist
 cleared, and the for some distance could be seen in the glare of the
 lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals
 of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock
 of the footsteps of the storm.
 
some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of
 absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with
 each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to
 snatch at and whirl away into space; here and there fishing-boat, with
 rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again
 the white wings of storm-tossed sea-bird. on the summit of the east
 cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been
 tried. the officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in
 the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.
 once or twice its service was most effective, as when fishing-boat,
 with gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance
 of the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the
 piers. as each boat achieved the safety of the port there was shout of
 joy from the mass of people on shore, shout which for moment seemed
 to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.
 
before long the searchlight discovered some distance away schooner
 with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed
 earlier in the evening. the wind had by this time backed to the east,
 and there was shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they
 realized the terrible danger in which she now was. between her and the
 port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time
 to time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,
 it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the
 harbour. it was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so
 great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost
 visible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such
 speed that, in the words of one old salt, “she must fetch up somewhere,
 if it was only in hell.” then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than
 any hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things
 like grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,
 for the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the
 booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder
 than before. the rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour
 mouth across the east pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited
 breathless. the wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant
 of the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between
 the piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,
 swept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and
 gained the safety of the harbour. the searchlight followed her, and a
 shudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a
 corpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each
 motion of the ship. other form could be seen on deck at all. great
 awe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by miracle, had
 found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of dead man! however,
 all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. the
 schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on
 that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many
 storms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the east
 cliff, known locally as tate hill pier.
 
there was of course considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on
 the sand heap. every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the
 “top-hammer” came crashing down. but, strangest of all, the very instant
 the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as
 if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow
 on the sand. making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard
 hangs over the laneway to the east pier so steeply that some of the flat
 tombstones--“thruff-steans” or “through-stones,” as they call them in
 the whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff
 has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed
 intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.
 
it so happened that there was one at the moment on tate hill pier, as
 all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were
 out on the heights above. thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern
 side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the
 first to climb on board. the men working the searchlight, after scouring
 the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the
 light on the derelict and kept it there. the coastguard ran aft, and
 when came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at
 once as though under some sudden emotion. this seemed to pique general
 curiosity, and quite number of people began to run. it is good way
 round from the west cliff by the drawbridge to tate hill pier, but your
 correspondent is fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.
 when i arrived, however, i found already assembled on the pier crowd,
 whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. by the
 courtesy of the chief boatman, i was, as your correspondent, permitted
 to climb on deck, and was one of small group who saw the dead seaman
 whilst actually lashed to the wheel.
 
it was wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for
 not often can such sight have been seen. the man was simply fastened
 by his hands, tied one over the other, to spoke of the wheel. between
 the inner hand and the wood was crucifix, the set of beads on which it
 was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by
 the binding cords. the poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but
 the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of
 the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he
 was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. accurate note was made of the
 state of things, and doctor--surgeon j. m. caffyn, of 33, east elliot
 place--who came immediately after me, declared, after making
 examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. in his
 pocket was bottle, carefully corked, empty save for little roll of
 paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. the coastguard said
 the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his
 teeth. the fact that coastguard was the first on board may save some
 complications, later on, in the admiralty court; for coastguards cannot
 claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a
 derelict. already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young
 law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already
 completely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the
 statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of
 delegated possession, is held in _dead hand_. it is needless to say
 that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where
 held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as
 noble as that of the young casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to
 await inquest.
 
already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;
 crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over
 the yorkshire wolds. i shall send, in time for your next issue, further
 details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into
 harbour in the storm.
 
_whitby_
 
_9 august._--the sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the
 storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. it
 turns out that the schooner is russian from varna, and is called the
 _demeter_. she is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a
 small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.
 this cargo was consigned to whitby solicitor, mr. s. f. billington, of
 7, the crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took
 possession of the goods consigned to him. the russian consul, too,
 acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and
 paid all harbour dues, etc. nothing is talked about here to-day except
 the strange coincidence; the officials of the board of trade have been
 most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with
 existing regulations. as the matter is to be “nine days’ wonder,” they
 are evidently determined that there shall be cause of after
 complaint. good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which
 landed when the ship struck, and more than few of the members of the
 s. p. c. a., which is very strong in whitby, have tried to befriend the
 animal. to the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;
 it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. it may be that it
 was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still
 hiding in terror. there are some who look with dread on such a
 possibility, lest later on it should in itself become danger, for it
 is evidently fierce brute. early this morning large dog, half-bred
 mastiff belonging to coal merchant close to tate hill pier, was found
 dead in the roadway opposite to its master’s yard. it had been fighting,
 and manifestly had had savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,
 and its belly was slit open as if with savage claw.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--by the kindness of the board of trade inspector, i have been
 permitted to look over the log-book of the _demeter_, which was in order
 up to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest
 except as to facts of missing men. the greatest interest, however, is
 with regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced
 at the inquest; and more strange narrative than the two between them
 unfold it has not been my lot to come across. as there is motive for
 concealment, i am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a
 rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and
 supercargo. it almost seems as though the captain had been seized with
 some kind of mania before had got well into blue water, and that
 this had developed persistently throughout the voyage. of course my
 statement must be taken _cum grano_, since i am writing from the
 dictation of clerk of the russian consul, who kindly translated for
 me, time being short.
 
log of the “demeter.”

* * * * *
 
on 6 july we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.
 at noon set sail. east wind, fresh. crew, five hands ... two mates,
 cook, and myself (captain).
 
* * * * *
 
on 11 july at dawn entered bosphorus. boarded by turkish customs
 officers. backsheesh. all correct. under way at 4 p. m.
 
* * * * *
 
on 12 july through dardanelles. more customs officers and flagboat of
 guarding squadron. backsheesh again. work of officers thorough, but
 quick. want us off soon. at dark passed into archipelago.
 
* * * * *
 
on 13 july passed cape matapan. crew dissatisfied about something.
 seemed scared, but would not speak out.
 
* * * * *
 
on 14 july was somewhat anxious about crew. men all steady fellows, who
 sailed with before. mate could not make out what was wrong; they only
 told him there was _something_, and crossed themselves. mate lost temper
 with one of them that day and struck him. expected fierce quarrel, but
 all was quiet.
 
* * * * *
 
on 16 july mate reported in the morning that one of crew, petrofsky, was
 missing. could not account for it. took larboard watch eight bells last
 night; was relieved by abramoff, but did not go to bunk. men more
 downcast than ever. all said they expected something of the kind, but
 would not say more than there was _something_ aboard. mate getting very
 impatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.
 
* * * * *
 
on 17 july, yesterday, one of the men, olgaren, came to my cabin, and in
 an awestruck way confided to that thought there was strange man
 aboard the ship. said that in his watch had been sheltering
 behind the deck-house, as there was rain-storm, when saw tall,
 thin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,
 and go along the deck forward, and disappear. followed cautiously,
 but when got to bows found one, and the hatchways were all closed.
 was in panic of superstitious fear, and i am afraid the panic may
 spread. to allay it, i shall to-day search entire ship carefully from
 stem to stern.
 
* * * * *
 
later in the day i got together the whole crew, and told them, as they
 evidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from
 stem to stern. first mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such
 foolish ideas would demoralise the men; said would engage to keep
 them out of trouble with handspike. i let him take the helm, while the
 rest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left
 corner unsearched. as there were only the big wooden boxes, there
 were odd corners where man could hide. men much relieved when
 search over, and went back to work cheerfully. first mate scowled, but
 said nothing.
 
* * * * *
 
_22 july_.--rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with
 sails--no time to be frightened. men seem to have forgotten their dread.
 mate cheerful again, and all on good terms. praised men for work in bad
 weather. passed gibralter and out through straits. all well.
 
* * * * *
 
_24 july_.--there seems some doom over this ship. already hand short,
 and entering on the bay of biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last
 night another man lost--disappeared. like the first, came off his
 watch and was not seen again. men all in panic of fear; sent round
 robin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. mate
 angry. fear there will be some trouble, as either or the men will do
 some violence.
 
* * * * *
 
_28 july_.--four days in hell, knocking about in sort of maelstrom,
 and the wind tempest. sleep for any one. men all worn out. hardly
 know how to set watch, since one fit to go on. second mate
 volunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch few hours’ sleep.
 wind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is
 steadier.
 
* * * * *
 
_29 july_.--another tragedy. had single watch to-night, as crew too
 tired to double. when morning watch came on deck could find one
 except steersman. raised outcry, and all came on deck. thorough search,
 but one found. are now without second mate, and crew in panic. mate
 and i agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.
 
* * * * *
 
_30 july_.--last night. rejoiced we are nearing england. weather fine,
 all sails set. retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling
 that both man of watch and steersman missing. only self and mate and
 two hands left to work ship.
 
* * * * *
 
_1 august_.--two days of fog, and not sail sighted. had hoped when in
 the english channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.
 not having power to work sails, have to run before wind. dare not lower,
 as could not raise them again. we seem to be drifting to some terrible
 doom. mate now more demoralised than either of men. his stronger nature
 seems to have worked inwardly against himself. men are beyond fear,
 working stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. they are
 russian, roumanian.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 august, midnight_.--woke up from few minutes’ sleep by hearing cry,
 seemingly outside my port. could see nothing in fog. rushed on deck, and
 ran against mate. tells heard cry and ran, but sign of man on
 watch. one more gone. lord, help us! mate says we must be past straits
 of dover, as in moment of fog lifting saw north foreland, just as
 heard the man cry out. if so we are now off in the north sea, and
 only god can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and god
 seems to have deserted us.
 
* * * * *
 
_3 august_.--at midnight i went to relieve the man at the wheel, and
 when i got to it found one there. the wind was steady, and as we ran
 before it there was yawing. i dared not leave it, so shouted for the
 mate. after few seconds rushed up on deck in his flannels. he
 looked wild-eyed and haggard, and i greatly fear his reason has given
 way. came close to and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my
 ear, as though fearing the very air might hear: “_it_ is here; i know
 it, now. on the watch last night i saw it, like man, tall and thin,
 and ghastly pale. it was in the bows, and looking out. i crept behind
 it, and gave it my knife; but the knife went through it, empty as the
 air.” and as spoke took his knife and drove it savagely into
 space. then went on: “but it is here, and i’ll find it. it is in the
 hold, perhaps in one of those boxes. i’ll unscrew them one by one and
 see. you work the helm.” and, with warning look and his finger on his
 lip, went below. there was springing up choppy wind, and i could
 not leave the helm. i saw him come out on deck again with tool-chest
 and lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. is mad, stark,
 raving mad, and it’s use my trying to stop him. can’t hurt those
 big boxes: they are invoiced as “clay,” and to pull them about is as
 harmless thing as can do. so here i stay, and mind the helm, and
 write these notes. i can only trust in god and wait till the fog clears.
 then, if i can’t steer to any harbour with the wind that is, i shall cut
 down sails and lie by, and signal for help....
 
* * * * *
 
it is nearly all over now. just as i was beginning to hope that the mate
 would come out calmer--for i heard him knocking away at something in the
 hold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway sudden,
 startled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he
 came as if shot from gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and
 his face convulsed with fear. “save me! save me!” cried, and then
 looked round on the blanket of fog. his horror turned to despair, and in
 steady voice said: “you had better come too, captain, before it is
 too late. _he_ is there. i know the secret now. the will save me
 from him, and it is all that is left!” before i could say word, or
 move forward to seize him, sprang on the bulwark and deliberately
 threw himself into the sea. i suppose i know the secret too, now. it was
 this madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now has
 followed them himself. god help me! how am i to account for all these
 horrors when i get to port? _when_ i get to port! will that ever be?
 
* * * * *
 
_4 august._--still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. i know there is
 sunrise because i am sailor, why else i know not. i dared not go
 below, i dared not leave the helm; so here all night i stayed, and in
 the dimness of the night i saw it--him! god forgive me, but the mate was
 right to jump overboard. it was better to die like man; to die like a
 sailor in blue water man can object. but i am captain, and i must not
 leave my ship. but i shall baffle this fiend or monster, for i shall tie
 my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with
 them i shall tie that which he--it!--dare not touch; and then, come good
 wind or foul, i shall save my soul, and my honour as captain. i am
 growing weaker, and the night is coming on. if can look in the
 face again, i may not have time to act.... if we are wrecked, mayhap
 this bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,
 ... well, then all men shall know that i have been true to my trust. god
 and the blessed virgin and the saints help poor ignorant soul trying
 to do his duty....
 
* * * * *
 
of course the verdict was an open one. there is evidence to adduce;
 and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now
 none to say. the folk here hold almost universally that the captain is
 simply hero, and is to be given public funeral. already it is
 arranged that his body is to be taken with train of boats up the esk
 for piece and then brought back to tate hill pier and up the abbey
 steps; for is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. the owners
 of more than hundred boats have already given in their names as
 wishing to follow him to the grave.
 
trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much
 mourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, would, i
 believe, be adopted by the town. to-morrow will see the funeral; and so
 will end this one more “mystery of the sea.”
 

_mina murray’s journal._
 
_8 august._--lucy was very restless all night, and i, too, could not
 sleep. the storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the
 chimney-pots, it made shudder. when sharp puff came it seemed to be
 like distant gun. strangely enough, lucy did not wake; but she got up
 twice and dressed herself. fortunately, each time i awoke in time and
 managed to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. it
 is very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is
 thwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,
 disappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her
 life.
 
early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see
 if anything had happened in the night. there were very few people about,
 and though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,
 grim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that
 topped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth
 of the harbour--like bullying man going through crowd. somehow i
 felt glad that jonathan was not on the last night, but on land. but,
 oh, is on land or sea? where is he, and how? i am getting fearfully
 anxious about him. if i only knew what to do, and could do anything!
 
* * * * *
 
_10 august._--the funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most
 touching. every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin
 was carried by captains all the way from tate hill pier up to the
 churchyard. lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst
 the cortège of boats went up the river to the viaduct and came down
 again. we had lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.
 the poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on
 it when the time came and saw everything. poor lucy seemed much upset.
 she was restless and uneasy all the time, and i cannot but think that
 her dreaming at night is telling on her. she is quite odd in one thing:
 she will not admit to that there is any cause for restlessness; or if
 there be, she does not understand it herself. there is an additional
 cause in that poor old mr. swales was found dead this morning on our
 seat, his neck being broken. had evidently, as the doctor said,
 fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was look of
 fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. poor
 dear old man! perhaps had seen death with his dying eyes! lucy is so
 sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other
 people do. just now she was quite upset by little thing which i did
 not much heed, though i am myself very fond of animals. one of the men
 who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.
 the dog is always with him. they are both quiet persons, and i never saw
 the man angry, nor heard the dog bark. during the service the dog would
 not come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept few
 yards off, barking and howling. its master spoke to it gently, and then
 harshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a
 noise. it was in sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs
 bristling out like cat’s tail when puss is on the war-path. finally
 the man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then
 took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on
 the tombstone on which the seat is fixed. the moment it touched the
 stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into tremble. it did
 not try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was
 in such pitiable state of terror that i tried, though without effect,
 to comfort it. lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to
 touch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. i greatly
 fear that she is of too super-sensitive nature to go through the world
 without trouble. she will be dreaming of this to-night, i am sure. the
 whole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by dead
 man; his attitude, tied to the wheel with crucifix and beads; the
 touching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all
 afford material for her dreams.
 
i think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so i
 shall take her for long walk by the cliffs to robin hood’s bay and
 back. she ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.
 



chapter viii
 
mina murray’s journal
 

_same day, 11 o’clock p. m._--oh, but i am tired! if it were not that i
 had made my diary duty i should not open it to-night. we had lovely
 walk. lucy, after while, was in gay spirits, owing, i think, to some
 dear cows who came nosing towards us in field close to the lighthouse,
 and frightened the wits out of us. i believe we forgot everything
 except, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean
 and give us fresh start. we had capital “severe tea” at robin hood’s
 bay in sweet little old-fashioned inn, with bow-window right over
 the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. i believe we should have
 shocked the “new woman” with our appetites. men are more tolerant, bless
 them! then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest,
 and with our hearts full of constant dread of wild bulls. lucy was
 really tired, and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could.
 the young curate came in, however, and mrs. westenra asked him to stay
 for supper. lucy and i had both fight for it with the dusty miller; i
 know it was hard fight on my part, and i am quite heroic. i think that
 some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up new
 class of curates, who don’t take supper, matter how they may be
 pressed to, and who will know when girls are tired. lucy is asleep and
 breathing softly. she has more colour in her cheeks than usual, and
 looks, oh, so sweet. if mr. holmwood fell in love with her seeing her
 only in the drawing-room, i wonder what would say if saw her now.
 some of the “new women” writers will some day start an idea that men and
 women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or
 accepting. but i suppose the new woman won’t condescend in future to
 accept; she will do the proposing herself. and nice job she will make
 of it, too! there’s some consolation in that. i am so happy to-night,
 because dear lucy seems better. i really believe she has turned the
 corner, and that we are over her troubles with dreaming. i should be
 quite happy if i only knew if jonathan.... god bless and keep him.
 
* * * * *
 
_11 august, 3 a. m._--diary again. sleep now, so i may as well write.
 i am too agitated to sleep. we have had such an adventure, such an
 agonising experience. i fell asleep as soon as i had closed my diary....
 suddenly i became broad awake, and sat up, with horrible sense of fear
 upon me, and of some feeling of emptiness around me. the room was dark,
 so i could not see lucy’s bed; i stole across and felt for her. the bed
 was empty. i lit match and found that she was not in the room. the
 door was shut, but not locked, as i had left it. i feared to wake her
 mother, who has been more than usually ill lately, so threw on some
 clothes and got ready to look for her. as i was leaving the room it
 struck that the clothes she wore might give some clue to her
 dreaming intention. dressing-gown would mean house; dress, outside.
 dressing-gown and dress were both in their places. “thank god,” i said
 to myself, “she cannot be far, as she is only in her nightdress.” i ran
 downstairs and looked in the sitting-room. not there! then i looked in
 all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear
 chilling my heart. finally i came to the hall door and found it open. it
 was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. the people
 of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so i feared that
 lucy must have gone out as she was. there was time to think of what
 might happen; vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. i took a
 big, heavy shawl and ran out. the clock was striking one as i was in the
 crescent, and there was not soul in sight. i ran along the north
 terrace, but could see sign of the white figure which i expected. at
 the edge of the west cliff above the pier i looked across the harbour to
 the east cliff, in the hope or fear--i don’t know which--of seeing lucy
 in our favourite seat. there was bright full moon, with heavy black,
 driving clouds, which threw the whole scene into fleeting diorama of
 light and shade as they sailed across. for moment or two i could see
 nothing, as the shadow of cloud obscured st. mary’s church and all
 around it. then as the cloud passed i could see the ruins of the abbey
 coming into view; and as the edge of narrow band of light as sharp as
 sword-cut moved along, the church and the churchyard became gradually
 visible. whatever my expectation was, it was not disappointed, for
 there, on our favourite seat, the silver light of the moon struck a
 half-reclining figure, snowy white. the coming of the cloud was too
 quick for to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost
 immediately; but it seemed to as though something dark stood behind
 the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. what it was,
 whether man or beast, i could not tell; i did not wait to catch another
 glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the
 fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the east
 cliff. the town seemed as dead, for not soul did i see; i rejoiced
 that it was so, for i wanted witness of poor lucy’s condition. the
 time and distance seemed endless, and my knees trembled and my breath
 came laboured as i toiled up the endless steps to the abbey. i must have
 gone fast, and yet it seemed to as if my feet were weighted with
 lead, and as though every joint in my body were rusty. when i got almost
 to the top i could see the seat and the white figure, for i was now
 close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow. there
 was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the
 half-reclining white figure. i called in fright, “lucy! lucy!” and
 something raised head, and from where i was i could see white face
 and red, gleaming eyes. lucy did not answer, and i ran on to the
 entrance of the churchyard. as i entered, the church was between and
 the seat, and for minute or so i lost sight of her. when i came in
 view again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly
 that i could see lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back
 of the seat. she was quite alone, and there was not sign of any living
 thing about.
 
when i bent over her i could see that she was still asleep. her lips
 were parted, and she was breathing--not softly as usual with her, but in
 long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every
 breath. as i came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the
 collar of her nightdress close around her throat. whilst she did so
 there came little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold. i
 flung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,
 for i dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,
 unclad as she was. i feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to
 have my hands free that i might help her, i fastened the shawl at her
 throat with big safety-pin; but i must have been clumsy in my anxiety
 and pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing
 became quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned. when i
 had her carefully wrapped up i put my shoes on her feet and then began
 very gently to wake her. at first she did not respond; but gradually she
 became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing
 occasionally. at last, as time was passing fast, and, for many other
 reasons, i wished to get her home at once, i shook her more forcibly,
 till finally she opened her eyes and awoke. she did not seem surprised
 to see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she was.
 lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such time, when her body must
 have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at waking
 unclad in churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace. she
 trembled little, and clung to me; when i told her to come at once with
 home she rose without word, with the obedience of child. as we
 passed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and lucy noticed wince. she
 stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but i would not.
 however, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there
 was puddle of water, remaining from the storm, i daubed my feet with
 mud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home, no
 one, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.
 
fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting soul. once we saw
 man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along street in front of
 us; but we hid in door till had disappeared up an opening such as
 there are here, steep little closes, or “wynds,” as they call them in
 scotland. my heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes i thought i
 should faint. i was filled with anxiety about lucy, not only for her
 health, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation
 in case the story should get wind. when we got in, and had washed our
 feet, and had said prayer of thankfulness together, i tucked her into
 bed. before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a
 word to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure. i
 hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her
 mother’s health, and how the knowledge of such thing would fret her,
 and thinking, too, of how such story might become distorted--nay,
 infallibly would--in case it should leak out, i thought it wiser to do
 so. i hope i did right. i have locked the door, and the key is tied to
 my wrist, so perhaps i shall not be again disturbed. lucy is sleeping
 soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....
 
* * * * *
 
_same day, noon._--all goes well. lucy slept till i woke her and seemed
 not to have even changed her side. the adventure of the night does not
 seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she
 looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. i was sorry to
 notice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her. indeed, it might
 have been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced. i must have
 pinched up piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are
 two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress
 was drop of blood. when i apologised and was concerned about it, she
 laughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it. fortunately it
 cannot leave scar, as it is so tiny.
 
* * * * *
 
_same day, night._--we passed happy day. the air was clear, and the
 sun bright, and there was cool breeze. we took our lunch to mulgrave
 woods, mrs. westenra driving by the road and lucy and i walking by the
 cliff-path and joining her at the gate. i felt little sad myself, for
 i could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had
 jonathan been with me. but there! i must only be patient. in the evening
 we strolled in the casino terrace, and heard some good music by spohr
 and mackenzie, and went to bed early. lucy seems more restful than she
 has been for some time, and fell asleep at once. i shall lock the door
 and secure the key the same as before, though i do not expect any
 trouble to-night.
 
* * * * *
 
_12 august._--my expectations were wrong, for twice during the night i
 was wakened by lucy trying to get out. she seemed, even in her sleep, to
 be little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed
 under sort of protest. i woke with the dawn, and heard the birds
 chirping outside of the window. lucy woke, too, and, i was glad to see,
 was even better than on the previous morning. all her old gaiety of
 manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in beside me
 and told all about arthur. i told her how anxious i was about
 jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me. well, she succeeded
 somewhat, for, though sympathy can’t alter facts, it can help to make
 them more bearable.
 
* * * * *
 
_13 august._--another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as
 before. again i awoke in the night, and found lucy sitting up in bed,
 still asleep, pointing to the window. i got up quietly, and pulling
 aside the blind, looked out. it was brilliant moonlight, and the soft
 effect of the light over the and sky--merged together in one great,
 silent mystery--was beautiful beyond words. between and the moonlight
 flitted great bat, coming and going in great whirling circles. once or
 twice it came quite close, but was, i suppose, frightened at seeing me,
 and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey. when i came back
 from the window lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping peacefully.
 she did not stir again all night.
 
* * * * *
 
_14 august._--on the east cliff, reading and writing all day. lucy seems
 to have become as much in love with the spot as i am, and it is hard to
 get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or
 dinner. this afternoon she made funny remark. we were coming home for
 dinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the west pier and
 stopped to look at the view, as we generally do. the setting sun, low
 down in the sky, was just dropping behind kettleness; the red light was
 thrown over on the east cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe
 everything in beautiful rosy glow. we were silent for while, and
 suddenly lucy murmured as if to herself:--
 
“his red eyes again! they are just the same.” it was such an odd
 expression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me. i
 slewed round little, so as to see lucy well without seeming to stare
 at her, and saw that she was in half-dreamy state, with an odd look on
 her face that i could not quite make out; so i said nothing, but
 followed her eyes. she appeared to be looking over at our own seat,
 whereon was dark figure seated alone. i was little startled myself,
 for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like
 burning flames; but second look dispelled the illusion. the red
 sunlight was shining on the windows of st. mary’s church behind our
 seat, and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the
 refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved. i
 called lucy’s attention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself
 with start, but she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she
 was thinking of that terrible night up there. we never refer to it; so i
 said nothing, and we went home to dinner. lucy had headache and went
 early to bed. i saw her asleep, and went out for little stroll myself;
 i walked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet
 sadness, for i was thinking of jonathan. when coming home--it was then
 bright moonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the
 crescent was in shadow, everything could be well seen--i threw glance
 up at our window, and saw lucy’s head leaning out. i thought that
 perhaps she was looking out for me, so i opened my handkerchief and
 waved it. she did not notice or make any movement whatever. just then,
 the moonlight crept round an angle of the building, and the light fell
 on the window. there distinctly was lucy with her head lying up against
 the side of the window-sill and her eyes shut. she was fast asleep, and
 by her, seated on the window-sill, was something that looked like a
 good-sized bird. i was afraid she might get chill, so i ran upstairs,
 but as i came into the room she was moving back to her bed, fast
 asleep, and breathing heavily; she was holding her hand to her throat,
 as though to protect it from cold.
 
i did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; i have taken care that the
 door is locked and the window securely fastened.
 
she looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont, and
 there is drawn, haggard look under her eyes which i do not like. i
 fear she is fretting about something. i wish i could find out what it
 is.
 
* * * * *
 
_15 august._--rose later than usual. lucy was languid and tired, and
 slept on after we had been called. we had happy surprise at breakfast.
 arthur’s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon. lucy
 is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. later on
 in the day she told the cause. she is grieved to lose lucy as her
 very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to
 protect her. poor dear, sweet lady! she confided to that she has got
 her death-warrant. she has not told lucy, and made promise secrecy;
 her doctor told her that within few months, at most, she must die, for
 her heart is weakening. at any time, even now, sudden shock would be
 almost sure to kill her. ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of
 the dreadful night of lucy’s sleep-walking.
 
* * * * *
 
_17 august._--no diary for two whole days. i have not had the heart to
 write. some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.
 news from jonathan, and lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her
 mother’s hours are numbering to close. i do not understand lucy’s
 fading away as she is doing. she eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys
 the fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and
 she gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night i hear her gasping
 as if for air. i keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at
 night, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open
 window. last night i found her leaning out when i woke up, and when i
 tried to wake her i could not; she was in faint. when i managed to
 restore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,
 painful struggles for breath. when i asked her how she came to be at the
 window she shook her head and turned away. i trust her feeling ill may
 not be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin. i looked at her throat
 just now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.
 they are still open, and, if anything, larger than before, and the
 edges of them are faintly white. they are like little white dots with
 red centres. unless they heal within day or two, i shall insist on the
 doctor seeing about them.

_mina murray’s journal._
 
_18 august._--i am happy to-day, and write sitting on the seat in the
 churchyard. lucy is ever so much better. last night she slept well all
 night, and did not disturb once. the roses seem coming back already
 to her cheeks, though she is still sadly pale and wan-looking. if she
 were in any way anæmic i could understand it, but she is not. she is in
 gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness. all the morbid reticence
 seems to have passed from her, and she has just reminded me, as if i
 needed any reminding, of _that_ night, and that it was here, on this
 very seat, i found her asleep. as she told she tapped playfully with
 the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said:--
 
“my poor little feet didn’t make much noise then! i daresay poor old mr.
 swales would have told that it was because i didn’t want to wake up
 geordie.” as she was in such communicative humour, i asked her if she
 had dreamed at all that night. before she answered, that sweet, puckered
 look came into her forehead, which arthur--i call him arthur from her
 habit--says loves; and, indeed, i don’t wonder that does. then she
 went on in half-dreaming kind of way, as if trying to recall it to
 herself:--
 
“i didn’t quite dream; but it all seemed to be real. i only wanted to be
 here in this spot--i don’t know why, for i was afraid of something--i
 don’t know what. i remember, though i suppose i was asleep, passing
 through the streets and over the bridge. fish leaped as i went by, and
 i leaned over to look at it, and i heard lot of dogs howling--the
 whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once--as
 i went up the steps. then i had vague memory of something long and
 dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very
 sweet and very bitter all around at once; and then i seemed sinking
 into deep green water, and there was singing in my ears, as i have
 heard there is to drowning men; and then everything seemed passing away
 from me; my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air.
 i seem to remember that once the west lighthouse was right under me,
 and then there was sort of agonising feeling, as if i were in an
 earthquake, and i came back and found you shaking my body. i saw you do
 it before i felt you.”
 
then she began to laugh. it seemed little uncanny to me, and i
 listened to her breathlessly. i did not quite like it, and thought it
 better not to keep her mind on the subject, so we drifted on to other
 subjects, and lucy was like her old self again. when we got home the
 fresh breeze had braced her up, and her pale cheeks were really more
 rosy. her mother rejoiced when she saw her, and we all spent very
 happy evening together.

_19 august._--joy, joy, joy! although not all joy. at last, news of
 jonathan. the dear fellow has been ill; that is why did not write. i
 am not afraid to think it or say it, now that i know. mr. hawkins sent
 on the letter, and wrote himself, oh, so kindly. i am to leave in the
 morning and go over to jonathan, and to help to nurse him if necessary,
 and to bring him home. mr. hawkins says it would not be bad thing if
 we were to be married out there. i have cried over the good sister’s
 letter till i can feel it wet against my bosom, where it lies. it is of
 jonathan, and must be next my heart, for is _in_ my heart. my journey
 is all mapped out, and my luggage ready. i am only taking one change of
 dress; lucy will bring my trunk to london and keep it till i send for
 it, for it may be that ... i must write more; i must keep it to say
 to jonathan, my husband. the letter that has seen and touched must
 comfort till we meet.
 

_letter, sister agatha, hospital of st. joseph and ste. mary,
 buda-pesth, to miss wilhelmina murray._
 
“_12 august._
 
“dear madam,--
 
“i write by desire of mr. jonathan harker, who is himself not strong
 enough to write, though progressing well, thanks to god and st. joseph
 and ste. mary. has been under our care for nearly six weeks,
 suffering from violent brain fever. wishes to convey his love,
 and to say that by this post i write for him to mr. peter hawkins,
 exeter, to say, with his dutiful respects, that is sorry for his
 delay, and that all of his work is completed. will require some few
 weeks’ rest in our sanatorium in the hills, but will then return. he
 wishes to say that has not sufficient money with him, and that he
 would like to pay for his staying here, so that others who need shall
 not be wanting for help.
 
“believe me,
 
“yours, with sympathy and all blessings,
 
“sister agatha.
 
“p. s.--my patient being asleep, i open this to let you know something
 more. has told all about you, and that you are shortly to be his
 wife. all blessings to you both! has had some fearful shock--so says
 our doctor--and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful; of
 wolves and poison and blood; of ghosts and demons; and i fear to say of
 what. be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him
 of this kind for long time to come; the traces of such an illness as
 his do not lightly die away. we should have written long ago, but we
 knew nothing of his friends, and there was on him nothing that any one
 could understand. came in the train from klausenburg, and the guard
 was told by the station-master there that rushed into the station
 shouting for ticket for home. seeing from his violent demeanour that
 was english, they gave him ticket for the furthest station on the
 way thither that the train reached.
 
“be assured that is well cared for. has won all hearts by his
 sweetness and gentleness. is truly getting on well, and i have no
 doubt will in few weeks be all himself. but be careful of him for
 safety’s sake. there are, i pray god and st. joseph and ste. mary, many,
 many, happy years for you both.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_19 august._--strange and sudden change in renfield last night. about
 eight o’clock began to get excited and sniff about as dog does when
 setting. the attendant was struck by his manner, and knowing my interest
 in him, encouraged him to talk. is usually respectful to the
 attendant and at times servile; but to-night, the man tells me, was
 quite haughty. would not condescend to talk with him at all. all he
 would say was:--
 
“i don’t want to talk to you: you don’t count now; the master is at
 hand.”
 
the attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has
 seized him. if so, we must look out for squalls, for strong man with
 homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous. the
 combination is dreadful one. at nine o’clock i visited him myself. his
 attitude to was the same as that to the attendant; in his sublime
 self-feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him
 as nothing. it looks like religious mania, and will soon think that
 himself is god. these infinitesimal distinctions between man and man
 are too paltry for an omnipotent being. how these madmen give themselves
 away! the real god taketh heed lest sparrow fall; but the god created
 from human vanity sees difference between an eagle and sparrow. oh,
 if men only knew!
 
for half an hour or more renfield kept getting excited in greater and
 greater degree. i did not pretend to be watching him, but i kept strict
 observation all the same. all at once that shifty look came into his
 eyes which we always see when madman has seized an idea, and with it
 the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to
 know so well. became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his
 bed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes. i thought i
 would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to
 lead him to talk of his pets, theme which had never failed to excite
 his attention. at first made reply, but at length said testily:--
 
“bother them all! i don’t care pin about them.”
 
“what?” i said. “you don’t mean to tell you don’t care about
 spiders?” (spiders at present are his hobby and the note-book is filling
 up with columns of small figures.) to this answered enigmatically:--
 
“the bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;
 but when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes
 that are filled.”
 
would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed
 all the time i remained with him.
 
i am weary to-night and low in spirits. i cannot but think of lucy, and
 how different things might have been. if i don’t sleep at once, chloral,
 the modern morpheus--c_{2}hcl_{3}o. h_{2}o! i must be careful not to let
 it grow into habit. no, i shall take none to-night! i have thought of
 lucy, and i shall not dishonour her by mixing the two. if need be,
 to-night shall be sleepless....
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--glad i made the resolution; gladder that i kept to it. i had
 lain tossing about, and had heard the clock strike only twice, when the
 night-watchman came to me, sent up from the ward, to say that renfield
 had escaped. i threw on my clothes and ran down at once; my patient is
 too dangerous person to be roaming about. those ideas of his might
 work out dangerously with strangers. the attendant was waiting for me.
 said had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his
 bed, when had looked through the observation-trap in the door. his
 attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out. he
 ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once
 sent up for me. was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.
 the attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where should
 go than to follow him, as might lose sight of him whilst getting out
 of the building by the door. is bulky man, and couldn’t get through
 the window. i am thin, so, with his aid, i got out, but feet foremost,
 and, as we were only few feet above ground, landed unhurt. the
 attendant told the patient had gone to the left, and had taken a
 straight line, so i ran as quickly as i could. as i got through the belt
 of trees i saw white figure scale the high wall which separates our
 grounds from those of the deserted house.
 
i ran back at once, told the watchman to get three or four men
 immediately and follow into the grounds of carfax, in case our friend
 might be dangerous. i got ladder myself, and crossing the wall,
 dropped down on the other side. i could see renfield’s figure just
 disappearing behind the angle of the house, so i ran after him. on the
 far side of the house i found him pressed close against the old
 ironbound oak door of the chapel. was talking, apparently to some
 one, but i was afraid to go near enough to hear what was saying, lest
 i might frighten him, and should run off. chasing an errant swarm of
 bees is nothing to following naked lunatic, when the fit of escaping
 is upon him! after few minutes, however, i could see that did not
 take note of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to
 him--the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him
 in. i heard him say:--
 
“i am here to do your bidding, master. i am your slave, and you will
 reward me, for i shall be faithful. i have worshipped you long and afar
 off. now that you are near, i await your commands, and you will not pass
 by, will you, dear master, in your distribution of good things?”
 
_is_ selfish old beggar anyhow. thinks of the loaves and fishes
 even when believes is in real presence. his manias make a
 startling combination. when we closed in on him fought like tiger.
 is immensely strong, for was more like wild beast than man. i
 never saw lunatic in such paroxysm of rage before; and i hope i
 shall not again. it is mercy that we have found out his strength and
 his danger in good time. with strength and determination like his, he
 might have done wild work before was caged. is safe now at any
 rate. jack sheppard himself couldn’t get free from the strait-waistcoat
 that keeps him restrained, and he’s chained to the wall in the padded
 room. his cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are
 more deadly still, for means murder in every turn and movement.
 
just now spoke coherent words for the first time:--
 
“i shall be patient, master. it is coming--coming--coming!”
 
so i took the hint, and came too. i was too excited to sleep, but this
 diary has quieted me, and i feel i shall get some sleep to-night.
 



chapter ix
 

_letter, mina harker to lucy westenra._
 
“_buda-pesth, 24 august._
 
“my dearest lucy,--
 
“i know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we
 parted at the railway station at whitby. well, my dear, i got to hull
 all right, and caught the boat to hamburg, and then the train on here. i
 feel that i can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that i
 knew i was coming to jonathan, and, that as i should have to do some
 nursing, i had better get all the sleep i could.... i found my dear one,
 oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. all the resolution has gone out
 of his dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which i told you was in his
 face has vanished. is only wreck of himself, and does not
 remember anything that has happened to him for long time past. at
 least, wants to believe so, and i shall never ask. has had some
 terrible shock, and i fear it might tax his poor brain if were to try
 to recall it. sister agatha, who is good creature and born nurse,
 tells that raved of dreadful things whilst was off his head. i
 wanted her to tell what they were; but she would only cross herself,
 and say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the
 secrets of god, and that if nurse through her vocation should hear
 them, she should respect her trust. she is sweet, good soul, and the
 next day, when she saw i was troubled, she opened up the subject again,
 and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved
 about, added: ‘i can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about
 anything which has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,
 have cause to be concerned. has not forgotten you or what owes
 to you. his fear was of great and terrible things, which mortal can
 treat of.’ i do believe the dear soul thought i might be jealous lest my
 poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. the idea of
 _my_ being jealous about jonathan! and yet, my dear, let whisper, i
 felt thrill of joy through when i _knew_ that other woman was a
 cause of trouble. i am now sitting by his bedside, where i can see his
 face while sleeps. is waking!...
 
“when woke asked for his coat, as wanted to get something
 from the pocket; i asked sister agatha, and she brought all his things.
 i saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to
 let look at it--for i knew then that i might find some clue to his
 trouble--but i suppose must have seen my wish in my eyes, for sent
 over to the window, saying wanted to be quite alone for moment.
 then called back, and when i came had his hand over the
 note-book, and said to very solemnly:--
 
“‘wilhelmina’--i knew then that was in deadly earnest, for has
 never called by that name since asked to marry him--‘you know,
 dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no
 secret, concealment. i have had great shock, and when i try to
 think of what it is i feel my head spin round, and i do not know if it
 was all real or the dreaming of madman. you know i have had brain
 fever, and that is to be mad. the secret is here, and i do not want to
 know it. i want to take up my life here, with our marriage.’ for, my
 dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are
 complete. ‘are you willing, wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? here is
 the book. take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me
 know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon to go back to
 the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.’ fell
 back exhausted, and i put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. i
 have asked sister agatha to beg the superior to let our wedding be this
 afternoon, and am waiting her reply....
 
* * * * *
 
“she has come and told that the chaplain of the english mission
 church has been sent for. we are to be married in an hour, or as soon
 after as jonathan awakes....
 
* * * * *
 
“lucy, the time has come and gone. i feel very solemn, but very, very
 happy. jonathan woke little after the hour, and all was ready, and he
 sat up in bed, propped up with pillows. answered his ‘i will’ firmly
 and strongly. i could hardly speak; my heart was so full that even those
 words seemed to choke me. the dear sisters were so kind. please god, i
 shall never, never forget them, nor the grave and sweet responsibilities
 i have taken upon me. i must tell you of my wedding present. when the
 chaplain and the sisters had left alone with my husband--oh, lucy, it
 is the first time i have written the words ‘my husband’--left alone
 with my husband, i took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it
 up in white paper, and tied it with little bit of pale blue ribbon
 which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax,
 and for my seal i used my wedding ring. then i kissed it and showed it
 to my husband, and told him that i would keep it so, and then it would
 be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each
 other; that i would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake
 or for the sake of some stern duty. then took my hand in his, and oh,
 lucy, it was the first time took _his wife’s_ hand, and said that it
 was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that would go
 through all the past again to win it, if need be. the poor dear meant to
 have said part of the past, but cannot think of time yet, and i
 shall not wonder if at first mixes up not only the month, but the
 year.
 
“well, my dear, what could i say? i could only tell him that i was the
 happiest woman in all the wide world, and that i had nothing to give him
 except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love
 and duty for all the days of my life. and, my dear, when kissed me,
 and drew to him with his poor weak hands, it was like very solemn
 pledge between us....
 
“lucy dear, do you know why i tell you all this? it is not only because
 it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to
 me. it was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from
 the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. i want you to see now,
 and with the eyes of very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that
 in your own married life you too may be all happy as i am. my dear,
 please almighty god, your life may be all it promises: long day of
 sunshine, with harsh wind, forgetting duty, distrust. i must
 not wish you pain, for that can never be; but i do hope you will be
 _always_ as happy as i am _now_. good-bye, my dear. i shall post this at
 once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. i must stop, for jonathan
 is waking--i must attend to my husband!
 
“your ever-loving
 
“mina harker.”
 

_letter, lucy westenra to mina harker._
 
“_whitby, 30 august._
 
“my dearest mina,--
 
“oceans of love and millions of kisses, and may you soon be in your own
 home with your husband. i wish you could be coming home soon enough to
 stay with us here. the strong air would soon restore jonathan; it has
 quite restored me. i have an appetite like cormorant, am full of
 life, and sleep well. you will be glad to know that i have quite given
 up walking in my sleep. i think i have not stirred out of my bed for a
 week, that is when i once got into it at night. arthur says i am getting
 fat. by the way, i forgot to tell you that arthur is here. we have such
 walks and drives, and rides, and rowing, and tennis, and fishing
 together; and i love him more than ever. _tells_ that loves me
 more, but i doubt that, for at first told that couldn’t love me
 more than did then. but this is nonsense. there is, calling to me.
 so more just at present from your loving

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_20 august._--the case of renfield grows even more interesting. has
 now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion.
 for the first week after his attack was perpetually violent. then one
 night, just as the moon rose, grew quiet, and kept murmuring to
 himself: “now i can wait; now i can wait.” the attendant came to tell
 me, so i ran down at once to have look at him. was still in the
 strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone
 from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--i might
 almost say, “cringing”--softness. i was satisfied with his present
 condition, and directed him to be relieved. the attendants hesitated,
 but finally carried out my wishes without protest. it was strange
 thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,
 coming close to me, said in whisper, all the while looking
 furtively at them:--
 
“they think i could hurt you! fancy _me_ hurting _you_! the fools!”
 
it was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated
 even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same i
 do not follow his thought. am i to take it that i have anything in
 common with him, so that we are, as it were, to stand together; or has
 to gain from some good so stupendous that my well-being is needful
 to him? i must find out later on. to-night will not speak. even the
 offer of kitten or even full-grown cat will not tempt him. will
 only say: “i don’t take any stock in cats. i have more to think of now,
 and i can wait; i can wait.”
 
after while i left him. the attendant tells that was quiet
 until just before dawn, and that then began to get uneasy, and at
 length violent, until at last fell into paroxysm which exhausted
 him so that swooned into sort of coma.
 
* * * * *
 
... three nights has the same thing happened--violent all day then quiet
 from moonrise to sunrise. i wish i could get some clue to the cause. it
 would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went.
 happy thought! we shall to-night play sane wits against mad ones. he
 escaped before without our help; to-night shall escape with it. we
 shall give him chance, and have the men ready to follow in case they
 are required....
 
* * * * *
 
_23 august._--“the unexpected always happens.” how well disraeli knew
 life. our bird when found the cage open would not fly, so all our
 subtle arrangements were for nought. at any rate, we have proved one
 thing; that the spells of quietness last reasonable time. we shall in
 future be able to ease his bonds for few hours each day. i have given
 orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room,
 when once is quiet, until an hour before sunrise. the poor soul’s
 body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it. hark!
 the unexpected again! i am called; the patient has once more escaped.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--another night adventure. renfield artfully waited until the
 attendant was entering the room to inspect. then dashed out past him
 and flew down the passage. i sent word for the attendants to follow.
 again went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him
 in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. when saw me
 became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he
 would have tried to kill me. as we were holding him strange thing
 happened. suddenly redoubled his efforts, and then as suddenly grew
 calm. i looked round instinctively, but could see nothing. then i caught
 the patient’s eye and followed it, but could trace nothing as it looked
 into the moonlit sky except big bat, which was flapping its silent and
 ghostly way to the west. bats usually wheel and flit about, but this one
 seemed to go straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had
 some intention of its own. the patient grew calmer every instant, and
 presently said:--
 
“you needn’t tie me; i shall go quietly!” without trouble we came back
 to the house. i feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall
 not forget this night....
 

_lucy westenra’s diary_
 
_hillingham, 24 august._--i must imitate mina, and keep writing things
 down. then we can have long talks when we do meet. i wonder when it will
 be. i wish she were with again, for i feel so unhappy. last night i
 seemed to be dreaming again just as i was at whitby. perhaps it is the
 change of air, or getting home again. it is all dark and horrid to me,
 for i can remember nothing; but i am full of vague fear, and i feel so
 weak and worn out. when arthur came to lunch looked quite grieved
 when saw me, and i hadn’t the spirit to try to be cheerful. i wonder
 if i could sleep in mother’s room to-night. i shall make an excuse and
 try.
 
* * * * *
 
_25 august._--another bad night. mother did not seem to take to my
 proposal. she seems not too well herself, and doubtless she fears to
 worry me. i tried to keep awake, and succeeded for while; but when the
 clock struck twelve it waked from doze, so i must have been falling
 asleep. there was sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but i
 did not mind it, and as i remember more, i suppose i must then have
 fallen asleep. more bad dreams. i wish i could remember them. this
 morning i am horribly weak. my face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains
 me. it must be something wrong with my lungs, for i don’t seem ever to
 get air enough. i shall try to cheer up when arthur comes, or else i
 know will be miserable to see so.

“_albemarle hotel, 31 august._
 
“my dear jack,--
 
“i want you to do favour. lucy is ill; that is, she has special
 disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. i have
 asked her if there is any cause; i do not dare to ask her mother, for to
 disturb the poor lady’s mind about her daughter in her present state of
 health would be fatal. mrs. westenra has confided to that her doom is
 spoken--disease of the heart--though poor lucy does not know it yet. i
 am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl’s mind. i am
 almost distracted when i think of her; to look at her gives pang. i
 told her i should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at
 first--i know why, old fellow--she finally consented. it will be a
 painful task for you, i know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, and
 i must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. you are to come to lunch at
 hillingham to-morrow, two o’clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in
 mrs. westenra, and after lunch lucy will take an opportunity of being
 alone with you. i shall come in for tea, and we can go away together; i
 am filled with anxiety, and want to consult with you alone as soon as i
 can after you have seen her. do not fail!
 
“arthur.”
 

_telegram, arthur holmwood to seward._
 
“_1 september._
 
“am summoned to see my father, who is worse. am writing. write fully
 by to-night’s post to ring. wire if necessary.”
 

_letter from dr. seward to arthur holmwood._
 
“_2 september._
 
“my dear old fellow,--
 
“with regard to miss westenra’s health i hasten to let you know at once
 that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady
 that i know of. at the same time, i am not by any means satisfied with
 her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when i saw
 her last. of course you must bear in mind that i did not have full
 opportunity of examination such as i should wish; our very friendship
 makes little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can
 bridge over. i had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to
 draw, in measure, your own conclusions. i shall then say what i have
 done and propose doing.
 
“i found miss westenra in seemingly gay spirits. her mother was present,
 and in few seconds i made up my mind that she was trying all she knew
 to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. i have no
 doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.
 we lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we
 got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness
 amongst us. then mrs. westenra went to lie down, and lucy was left with
 me. we went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,
 for the servants were coming and going. as soon as the door was closed,
 however, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into chair
 with great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand. when i saw that her
 high spirits had failed, i at once took advantage of her reaction to
 make diagnosis. she said to very sweetly:--
 
“‘i cannot tell you how i loathe talking about myself.’ i reminded her
 that doctor’s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously
 anxious about her. she caught on to my meaning at once, and settled that
 matter in word. ‘tell arthur everything you choose. i do not care for
 myself, but all for him!’ so i am quite free.
 
“i could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but i could not see
 the usual anæmic signs, and by chance i was actually able to test the
 quality of her blood, for in opening window which was stiff cord
 gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass. it was a
 slight matter in itself, but it gave an evident chance, and i secured
 few drops of the blood and have analysed them. the qualitative
 analysis gives quite normal condition, and shows, i should infer, in
 itself vigorous state of health. in other physical matters i was quite
 satisfied that there is need for anxiety; but as there must be a
 cause somewhere, i have come to the conclusion that it must be something
 mental. she complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at
 times, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her, but
 regarding which she can remember nothing. she says that as child she
 used to walk in her sleep, and that when in whitby the habit came back,
 and that once she walked out in the night and went to east cliff, where
 miss murray found her; but she assures that of late the habit has not
 returned. i am in doubt, and so have done the best thing i know of; i
 have written to my old friend and master, professor helsing, of
 amsterdam, who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the
 world. i have asked him to come over, and as you told that all things
 were to be at your charge, i have mentioned to him who you are and your
 relations to miss westenra. this, my dear fellow, is in obedience to
 your wishes, for i am only too proud and happy to do anything i can for
 her. helsing would, i know, do anything for for personal
 reason, so, matter on what ground comes, we must accept his
 wishes. is seemingly arbitrary man, but this is because knows
 what is talking about better than any one else. is philosopher
 and metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day;
 and has, i believe, an absolutely open mind. this, with an iron
 nerve, temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,
 self-command, and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and the
 kindliest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for the
 noble work that is doing for mankind--work both in theory and
 practice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy. i
 tell you these facts that you may know why i have such confidence in
 him. i have asked him to come at once. i shall see miss westenra
 to-morrow again. she is to meet at the stores, so that i may not
 alarm her mother by too early repetition of my call.

“my good friend,--
 
“when i have received your letter i am already coming to you. by good
 fortune i can leave just at once, without wrong to any of those who have

 to hand, and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too
 late on to-morrow, for it is likely that i may have to return here that
 night. but if need be i shall come again in three days, and stay longer
 if it must. till then good-bye, my friend john.
 
“van helsing.”
 

_letter, dr. seward to hon. arthur holmwood._
 
“_3 september._
 
“my dear art,--
 
“van helsing has come and gone. came on with to hillingham, and
 found that, by lucy’s discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that
 we were alone with her. helsing made very careful examination of
 the patient. is to report to me, and i shall advise you, for of
 course i was not present all the time. is, i fear, much concerned,
 but says must think. when i told him of our friendship and how you
 trust to in the matter, said: ‘you must tell him all you think.
 tell him what i think, if you can guess it, if you will. nay, i am not
 jesting. this is jest, but life and death, perhaps more.’ i asked
 what meant by that, for was very serious. this was when we had
 come back to town, and was having cup of tea before starting on his
 return to amsterdam. would not give any further clue. you must not
 be angry with me, art, because his very reticence means that all his
 brains are working for her good. will speak plainly enough when the
 time comes, be sure. so i told him i would simply write an account of
 our visit, just as if i were doing descriptive special article for
 _the daily telegraph_. seemed not to notice, but remarked that the
 smuts in london were not quite so bad as they used to be when was a
 student here. i am to get his report to-morrow if can possibly make
 it. in any case i am to have letter.
 
“well, as to the visit. lucy was more cheerful than on the day i first
 saw her, and certainly looked better. she had lost something of the
 ghastly look that so upset you, and her breathing was normal. she was
 very sweet to the professor (as she always is), and tried to make him
 feel at ease; though i could see that the poor girl was making hard
 struggle for it. i believe helsing saw it, too, for i saw the quick
 look under his bushy brows that i knew of old. then began to chat of
 all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite
 geniality that i could see poor lucy’s pretense of animation merge into
 reality. then, without any seeming change, brought the conversation
 gently round to his visit, and suavely said:--
 
“‘my dear young miss, i have the so great pleasure because you are so
 much beloved. that is much, my dear, ever were there that which i do not
 see. they told you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a
 ghastly pale. to them i say: “pouf!”’ and snapped his fingers at me
 and went on: ‘but you and i shall show them how wrong they are. how can
 he’--and pointed at with the same look and gesture as that with
 which once pointed out to his class, on, or rather after, a
 particular occasion which never fails to remind of--‘know anything
 of young ladies? has his madmans to play with, and to bring them
 back to happiness, and to those that love them. it is much to do, and,
 oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. but the
 young ladies! has wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell
 themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many
 sorrows and the causes of them. so, my dear, we will send him away to
 smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and i have little talk all
 to ourselves.’ i took the hint, and strolled about, and presently the
 professor came to the window and called in. looked grave, but
 said: ‘i have made careful examination, but there is functional
 cause. with you i agree that there has been much blood lost; it has
 been, but is not. but the conditions of her are in way anæmic. i have
 asked her to send her maid, that i may ask just one or two question,
 that so i may not chance to miss nothing. i know well what she will say.
 and yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. i must go
 back home and think. you must send to the telegram every day; and if
 there be cause i shall come again. the disease--for not to be all well
 is disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me
 too. she charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, i come.’
 
“as i tell you, would not say word more, even when we were alone.
 and so now, art, you know all i know. i shall keep stern watch. i trust
 your poor father is rallying. it must be terrible thing to you, my
 dear old fellow, to be placed in such position between two people who
 are both so dear to you. i know your idea of duty to your father, and
 you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, i shall send you word to
 come at once to lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from
 me.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_4 september._--zoöphagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.
 had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. just
 before the stroke of noon began to grow restless. the attendant knew
 the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. fortunately the men came at a
 run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon became so
 violent that it took all their strength to hold him. in about five
 minutes, however, began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank
 into sort of melancholy, in which state has remained up to now. the
 attendant tells that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really
 appalling; i found my hands full when i got in, attending to some of the
 other patients who were frightened by him. indeed, i can quite
 understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though i was
 some distance away. it is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and
 as yet my patient sits in corner brooding, with dull, sullen,
 woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show
 something directly. i cannot quite understand it.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--another change in my patient. at five o’clock i looked in on
 him, and found him seemingly as happy and contented as used to be. he
 was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his capture
 by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of
 padding. when saw me, came over and apologised for his bad
 conduct, and asked in very humble, cringing way to be led back to
 his own room and to have his note-book again. i thought it well to
 humour him: so is back in his room with the window open. has the
 sugar of his tea spread out on the window-sill, and is reaping quite a
 harvest of flies. is not now eating them, but putting them into a
 box, as of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find
 spider. i tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any
 clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but would not
 rise. for moment or two looked very sad, and said in sort of
 far-away voice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--
 
“all over! all over! has deserted me. hope for now unless i do
 it for myself!” then suddenly turning to in resolute way, said:
 “doctor, won’t you be very good to and let have little more
 sugar? i think it would be good for me.”
 
“and the flies?” i said.
 
“yes! the flies like it, too, and i like the flies; therefore i like
 it.” and there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do
 not argue. i procured him double supply, and left him as happy man
 as, i suppose, any in the world. i wish i could fathom his mind.
 
* * * * *
 
_midnight._--another change in him. i had been to see miss westenra,
 whom i found much better, and had just returned, and was standing at our
 own gate looking at the sunset, when once more i heard him yelling. as
 his room is on this side of the house, i could hear it better than in
 the morning. it was shock to to turn from the wonderful smoky
 beauty of sunset over london, with its lurid lights and inky shadows
 and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul
 water, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone
 building, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart
 to endure it all. i reached him just as the sun was going down, and from
 his window saw the red disc sink. as it sank became less and less
 frenzied; and just as it dipped slid from the hands that held him, an
 inert mass, on the floor. it is wonderful, however, what intellectual
 recuperative power lunatics have, for within few minutes stood up
 quite calmly and looked around him. i signalled to the attendants not to
 hold him, for i was anxious to see what would do. went straight
 over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then took his
 fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then shut
 the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. all this surprised
 me, so i asked him: “are you not going to keep flies any more?”
 
“no,” said he; “i am sick of all that rubbish!” certainly is a
 wonderfully interesting study. i wish i could get some glimpse of his
 mind or of the cause of his sudden passion. stop; there may be clue
 after all, if we can find why to-day his paroxysms came on at high noon
 and at sunset. can it be that there is malign influence of the sun at
 periods which affects certain natures--as at times the moon does others?
 we shall see.

_letter, dr. seward to hon. arthur holmwood._
 
“_6 september._
 
“my dear art,--
 
“my news to-day is not so good. lucy this morning had gone back bit.
 there is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; mrs.
 westenra was naturally anxious concerning lucy, and has consulted me
 professionally about her. i took advantage of the opportunity, and told
 her that my old master, helsing, the great specialist, was coming to
 stay with me, and that i would put her in his charge conjointly with
 myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a
 shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in lucy’s weak
 condition, might be disastrous to her. we are hedged in with
 difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please god, we shall
 come through them all right. if any need i shall write, so that, if you
 do not hear from me, take it for granted that i am simply waiting for
 news. in haste
 
“yours ever,
 
“john seward.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_7 september._--the first thing helsing said to when we met at
 liverpool street was:--
 
“have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her?”
 
“no,” i said. “i waited till i had seen you, as i said in my telegram. i
 wrote him letter simply telling him that you were coming, as miss
 westenra was not so well, and that i should let him know if need be.”
 
“right, my friend,” said, “quite right! better not know as yet;
 perhaps shall never know. i pray so; but if it be needed, then he
 shall know all. and, my good friend john, let caution you. you deal
 with the madmen. all men are mad in some way or the other; and inasmuch
 as you deal discreetly with your madmen, so deal with god’s madmen,
 too--the rest of the world. you tell not your madmen what you do nor why
 you do it; you tell them not what you think. so you shall keep knowledge
 in its place, where it may rest--where it may gather its kind around it
 and breed. you and i shall keep as yet what we know here, and here.” he
 touched on the heart and on the forehead, and then touched himself
 the same way. “i have for myself thoughts at the present. later i shall
 unfold to you.”
 
“why not now?” i asked. “it may do some good; we may arrive at some
 decision.” stopped and looked at me, and said:--
 
“my friend john, when the corn is grown, even before it has
 ripened--while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine
 has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman pull the
 ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff,
 and say to you: ‘look! he’s good corn; will make good crop when the
 time comes.’” i did not see the application, and told him so. for reply
 reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully, as
 used long ago to do at lectures, and said: “the good husbandman tell
 you so then because knows, but not till then. but you do not find the
 good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if grow; that is for
 the children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of
 the work of their life. see you now, friend john? i have sown my corn,
 and nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if sprout at all,
 there’s some promise; and i wait till the ear begins to swell.” broke
 off, for evidently saw that i understood. then went on, and very
 gravely:--
 
“you were always careful student, and your case-book was ever more
 full than the rest. you were only student then; now you are master, and
 i trust that good habit have not fail. remember, my friend, that
 knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.
 even if you have not kept the good practise, let tell you that this
 case of our dear miss is one that may be--mind, i say _may be_--of such
 interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the
 beam, as your peoples say. take then good note of it. nothing is too
 small. i counsel you, put down in record even your doubts and surmises.
 hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess. we
 learn from failure, not from success!”
 
when i described lucy’s symptoms--the same as before, but infinitely
 more marked--he looked very grave, but said nothing. took with him a
 bag in which were many instruments and drugs, “the ghastly paraphernalia
 of our beneficial trade,” as once called, in one of his lectures, the
 equipment of professor of the healing craft. when we were shown in,
 mrs. westenra met us. she was alarmed, but not nearly so much as i
 expected to find her. nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained
 that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. here, in case
 where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some
 cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her
 daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. it is
 something like the way dame nature gathers round foreign body an
 envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that
 which it would otherwise harm by contact. if this be an ordered
 selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice
 of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have
 knowledge of.
 
i used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down
 rule that she should not be present with lucy or think of her illness
 more than was absolutely required. she assented readily, so readily that
 i saw again the hand of nature fighting for life. helsing and i were
 shown up to lucy’s room. if i was shocked when i saw her yesterday, i
 was horrified when i saw her to-day. she was ghastly, chalkily pale; the
 red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of
 her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or
 hear. helsing’s face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged
 till they almost touched over his nose. lucy lay motionless, and did not
 seem to have strength to speak, so for while we were all silent. then
 helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. the
 instant we had closed the door stepped quickly along the passage to
 the next door, which was open. then pulled quickly in with him and
 closed the door. “my god!” said; “this is dreadful. there is time
 to be lost. she will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart’s
 action as it should be. there must be transfusion of blood at once. is
 it you or me?”
 
“i am younger and stronger, professor. it must be me.”
 
“then get ready at once. i will bring up my bag. i am prepared.”
 
i went downstairs with him, and as we were going there was knock at
 the hall-door. when we reached the hall the maid had just opened the
 door, and arthur was stepping quickly in. rushed up to me, saying in
 an eager whisper:--
 
“jack, i was so anxious. i read between the lines of your letter, and
 have been in an agony. the dad was better, so i ran down here to see for
 myself. is not that gentleman dr. helsing? i am so thankful to you,
 sir, for coming.” when first the professor’s eye had lit upon him had
 been angry at his interruption at such time; but now, as took in
 his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which
 seemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed. without pause said to
 him gravely as held out his hand:--
 
“sir, you have come in time. you are the lover of our dear miss. she is
 bad, very, very bad. nay, my child, do not go like that.” for he
 suddenly grew pale and sat down in chair almost fainting. “you are to
 help her. you can do more than any that live, and your courage is your
 best help.”
 
“what can i do?” asked arthur hoarsely. “tell me, and i shall do it. my
 life is hers, and i would give the last drop of blood in my body for
 her.” the professor has strongly humorous side, and i could from old
 knowledge detect trace of its origin in his answer:--
 
“my young sir, i do not ask so much as that--not the last!”
 
“what shall i do?” there was fire in his eyes, and his open nostril
 quivered with intent. helsing slapped him on the shoulder. “come!”
 said. “you are man, and it is man we want. you are better than
 me, better than my friend john.” arthur looked bewildered, and the
 professor went on by explaining in kindly way:--
 
“young miss is bad, very bad. she wants blood, and blood she must have
 or die. my friend john and i have consulted; and we are about to perform
 what we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to
 the empty veins which pine for him. john was to give his blood, as is
 the more young and strong than me”--here arthur took my hand and wrung
 it hard in silence--“but, now you are here, you are more good than us,
 old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. our nerves are not
 so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!” arthur turned to him
 and said:--
 
“if you only knew how gladly i would die for her you would
 understand----”
 
stopped, with sort of choke in his voice.
 
“good boy!” said helsing. “in the not-so-far-off you will be happy
 that you have done all for her you love. come now and be silent. you
 shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you
 must leave at my sign. say word to madame; you know how it is with
 her! there must be shock; any knowledge of this would be one. come!”
 
we all went up to lucy’s room. arthur by direction remained outside.
 lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. she was not
 asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. her eyes spoke
 to us; that was all. helsing took some things from his bag and laid
 them on little table out of sight. then mixed narcotic, and
 coming over to the bed, said cheerily:--
 
“now, little miss, here is your medicine. drink it off, like good
 child. see, i lift you so that to swallow is easy. yes.” she had made
 the effort with success.
 
it astonished how long the drug took to act. this, in fact, marked
 the extent of her weakness. the time seemed endless until sleep began to
 flicker in her eyelids. at last, however, the narcotic began to manifest
 its potency; and she fell into deep sleep. when the professor was
 satisfied called arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his
 coat. then added: “you may take that one little kiss whiles i bring
 over the table. friend john, help to me!” so neither of us looked whilst
 bent over her.
 
helsing turning to me, said:
 
“he is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not
 defibrinate it.”
 
then with swiftness, but with absolute method, helsing performed the
 operation. as the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come
 back to poor lucy’s cheeks, and through arthur’s growing pallor the joy
 of his face seemed absolutely to shine. after bit i began to grow
 anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on arthur, strong man as he
 was. it gave an idea of what terrible strain lucy’s system must
 have undergone that what weakened arthur only partially restored her.
 but the professor’s face was set, and stood watch in hand and with
 his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on arthur. i could hear my own
 heart beat. presently said in soft voice: “do not stir an instant.
 it is enough. you attend him; i will look to her.” when all was over i
 could see how much arthur was weakened. i dressed the wound and took his
 arm to bring him away, when helsing spoke without turning round--the
 man seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--
 
“the brave lover, i think, deserve another kiss, which shall have
 presently.” and as had now finished his operation, adjusted the
 pillow to the patient’s head. as did so the narrow black velvet band
 which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old
 diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged little up,
 and showed red mark on her throat. arthur did not notice it, but i
 could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of helsing’s
 ways of betraying emotion. said nothing at the moment, but turned to
 me, saying: “now take down our brave young lover, give him of the port
 wine, and let him lie down while. must then go home and rest, sleep
 much and eat much, that may be recruited of what has so given to
 his love. must not stay here. hold! moment. i may take it, sir,
 that you are anxious of result. then bring it with you that in all ways
 the operation is successful. you have saved her life this time, and you
 can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is. i shall tell
 her all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you
 have done. good-bye.”
 
when arthur had gone i went back to the room. lucy was sleeping gently,
 but her breathing was stronger; i could see the counterpane move as her
 breast heaved. by the bedside sat helsing, looking at her intently.
 the velvet band again covered the red mark. i asked the professor in a
 whisper:--
 
“what do you make of that mark on her throat?”
 
“what do you make of it?”
 
“i have not examined it yet,” i answered, and then and there proceeded
 to loose the band. just over the external jugular vein there were two
 punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. there was sign of
 disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some
 trituration. it at once occurred to that this wound, or whatever it
 was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but i abandoned
 the idea as soon as formed, for such thing could not be. the whole bed
 would have been drenched to scarlet with the blood which the girl must
 have lost to leave such pallor as she had before the transfusion.
 
“well?” said helsing.
 
“well,” said i, “i can make nothing of it.” the professor stood up. “i
 must go back to amsterdam to-night,” said. “there are books and
 things there which i want. you must remain here all the night, and you
 must not let your sight pass from her.”
 
“shall i have nurse?” i asked.
 
“we are the best nurses, you and i. you keep watch all night; see that
 she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. you must not sleep all
 the night. later on we can sleep, you and i. i shall be back as soon as
 possible. and then we may begin.”
 
“may begin?” i said. “what on earth do you mean?”
 
“we shall see!” answered, as hurried out. came back moment
 later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held
 up:--
 
“remember, she is your charge. if you leave her, and harm befall, you
 shall not sleep easy hereafter!”
 

_dr. seward’s diary--continued._
 
_8 september._--i sat up all night with lucy. the opiate worked itself
 off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked different being
 from what she had been before the operation. her spirits even were good,
 and she was full of happy vivacity, but i could see evidences of the
 absolute prostration which she had undergone. when i told mrs. westenra
 that dr. helsing had directed that i should sit up with her she
 almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter’s renewed
 strength and excellent spirits. i was firm, however, and made
 preparations for my long vigil. when her maid had prepared her for the
 night i came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took seat by
 the bedside. she did not in any way make objection, but looked at me
 gratefully whenever i caught her eye. after long spell she seemed
 sinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together
 and shook it off. this was repeated several times, with greater effort
 and with shorter pauses as the time moved on. it was apparent that she
 did not want to sleep, so i tackled the subject at once:--
 
“you do not want to go to sleep?”
 
“no; i am afraid.”
 
“afraid to go to sleep! why so? it is the boon we all crave for.”
 
“ah, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you presage of horror!”
 
“a presage of horror! what on earth do you mean?”
 
“i don’t know; oh, i don’t know. and that is what is so terrible. all
 this weakness comes to in sleep; until i dread the very thought.”
 
“but, my dear girl, you may sleep to-night. i am here watching you, and
 i can promise that nothing will happen.”
 
“ah, i can trust you!” i seized the opportunity, and said: “i promise
 you that if i see any evidence of bad dreams i will wake you at once.”
 
“you will? oh, will you really? how good you are to me. then i will
 sleep!” and almost at the word she gave deep sigh of relief, and sank
 back, asleep.
 
all night long i watched by her. she never stirred, but slept on and on
 in deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. her lips were
 slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a
 pendulum. there was smile on her face, and it was evident that bad
 dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.
 
in the early morning her maid came, and i left her in her care and took
 myself back home, for i was anxious about many things. i sent short
 wire to helsing and to arthur, telling them of the excellent result
 of the operation. my own work, with its manifold arrears, took all
 day to clear off; it was dark when i was able to inquire about my
 zoöphagous patient. the report was good; had been quite quiet for the
 past day and night. telegram came from helsing at amsterdam whilst
 i was at dinner, suggesting that i should be at hillingham to-night, as
 it might be well to be at hand, and stating that was leaving by the
 night mail and would join early in the morning.
 
* * * * *
 
_9 september_.--i was pretty tired and worn out when i got to
 hillingham. for two nights i had hardly had wink of sleep, and my
 brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral
 exhaustion. lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. when she shook hands
 with she looked sharply in my face and said:--
 
“no sitting up to-night for you. you are worn out. i am quite well
 again; indeed, i am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is i who
 will sit up with you.” i would not argue the point, but went and had my
 supper. lucy came with me, and, enlivened by her charming presence, i
 made an excellent meal, and had couple of glasses of the more than
 excellent port. then lucy took upstairs, and showed room next
 her own, where cozy fire was burning. “now,” she said, “you must stay
 here. i shall leave this door open and my door too. you can lie on the
 sofa for i know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to
 bed whilst there is patient above the horizon. if i want anything i
 shall call out, and you can come to at once.” i could not but
 acquiesce, for i was “dog-tired,” and could not have sat up had i tried.
 so, on her renewing her promise to call if she should want anything,
 i lay on the sofa, and forgot all about everything.
 

_lucy westenra’s diary._
 
_9 september._--i feel so happy to-night. i have been so miserably weak,
 that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after
 long spell of east wind out of steel sky. somehow arthur feels very,
 very close to me. i seem to feel his presence warm about me. i suppose
 it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner
 eyes and sympathy on ourselves, whilst health and strength give love
 rein, and in thought and feeling can wander where wills. i know
 where my thoughts are. if arthur only knew! my dear, my dear, your ears
 must tingle as you sleep, as mine do waking. oh, the blissful rest of
 last night! how i slept, with that dear, good dr. seward watching me.
 and to-night i shall not fear to sleep, since is close at hand and
 within call. thank everybody for being so good to me! thank god!
 good-night, arthur.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_10 september._--i was conscious of the professor’s hand on my head, and
 started awake all in second. that is one of the things that we learn
 in an asylum, at any rate.
 
“and how is our patient?”
 
“well, when i left her, or rather when she left me,” i answered.
 
“come, let us see,” said. and together we went into the room.
 
the blind was down, and i went over to raise it gently, whilst van
 helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.
 
as i raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, i
 heard the professor’s low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a
 deadly fear shot through my heart. as i passed over moved back, and
 his exclamation of horror, “gott in himmel!” needed enforcement from
 his agonised face. raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his
 iron face was drawn and ashen white. i felt my knees begin to tremble.
 
there on the bed, seemingly in swoon, lay poor lucy, more horribly
 white and wan-looking than ever. even the lips were white, and the gums
 seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a
 corpse after prolonged illness. helsing raised his foot to stamp
 in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit
 stood to him, and put it down again softly. “quick!” said. “bring
 the brandy.” i flew to the dining-room, and returned with the decanter.
 wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and
 wrist and heart. felt her heart, and after few moments of agonising
 suspense said:--
 
“it is not too late. it beats, though but feebly. all our work is
 undone; we must begin again. there is young arthur here now; i have
 to call on you yourself this time, friend john.” as spoke, was
 dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; i
 had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. there was no
 possibility of an opiate just at present, and need of one; and so,
 without moment’s delay, we began the operation. after time--it did
 not seem short time either, for the draining away of one’s blood, no
 matter how willingly it be given, is terrible feeling--van helsing
 held up warning finger. “do not stir,” said, “but i fear that with
 growing strength she may wake; and that would make danger, oh, so much
 danger. but i shall precaution take. i shall give hypodermic injection
 of morphia.” proceeded then, swiftly and deftly, to carry out his
 intent. the effect on lucy was not bad, for the faint seemed to merge
 subtly into the narcotic sleep. it was with feeling of personal pride
 that i could see faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid
 cheeks and lips. man knows, till experiences it, what it is to
 feel his own life-blood drawn away into the veins of the woman loves.
 
the professor watched critically. “that will do,” said. “already?”
 i remonstrated. “you took great deal more from art.” to which he
 smiled sad sort of smile as replied:--
 
“he is her lover, her _fiancé_. you have work, much work, to do for her
 and for others; and the present will suffice.”
 
when we stopped the operation, attended to lucy, whilst i applied
 digital pressure to my own incision. i laid down, whilst i waited his
 leisure to attend to me, for i felt faint and little sick. by-and-by
 bound up my wound, and sent downstairs to get glass of wine for
 myself. as i was leaving the room, came after me, and half
 whispered:--
 
“mind, nothing must be said of this. if our young lover should turn up
 unexpected, as before, word to him. it would at once frighten him and
 enjealous him, too. there must be none. so!”
 
when i came back looked at carefully, and then said:--
 
“you are not much the worse. go into the room, and lie on your sofa, and
 rest awhile; then have much breakfast, and come here to me.”
 
i followed out his orders, for i knew how right and wise they were. i
 had done my part, and now my next duty was to keep up my strength. i
 felt very weak, and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at
 what had occurred. i fell asleep on the sofa, however, wondering over
 and over again how lucy had made such retrograde movement, and how
 she could have been drained of so much blood with sign anywhere to
 show for it. i think i must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,
 sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little
 punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their
 edges--tiny though they were.
 
lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and
 strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. when helsing
 had seen her, went out for walk, leaving in charge, with strict
 injunctions that i was not to leave her for moment. i could hear his
 voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.
 
lucy chatted with freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything
 had happened. i tried to keep her amused and interested. when her mother
 came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but
 said to gratefully:--
 
“we owe you so much, dr. seward, for all you have done, but you really
 must now take care not to overwork yourself. you are looking pale
 yourself. you want wife to nurse and look after you bit; that you
 do!” as she spoke, lucy turned crimson, though it was only momentarily,
 for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted
 drain to the head. the reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned
 imploring eyes on me. i smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my
 lips; with sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.
 
helsing returned in couple of hours, and presently said to me:
 “now you go home, and eat much and drink enough. make yourself strong. i
 stay here to-night, and i shall sit up with little miss myself. you and
 i must watch the case, and we must have none other to know. i have grave
 reasons. no, do not ask them; think what you will. do not fear to think
 even the most not-probable. good-night.”
 
in the hall two of the maids came to me, and asked if they or either of
 them might not sit up with miss lucy. they implored to let them; and
 when i said it was dr. helsing’s wish that either or i should sit
 up, they asked quite piteously to intercede with the “foreign
 gentleman.” i was much touched by their kindness. perhaps it is because
 i am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on lucy’s account, that
 their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have i seen
 similar instances of woman’s kindness. i got back here in time for a
 late dinner; went my rounds--all well; and set this down whilst waiting
 for sleep. it is coming.
 
* * * * *
 
_11 september._--this afternoon i went over to hillingham. found van
 helsing in excellent spirits, and lucy much better. shortly after i had
 arrived, big parcel from abroad came for the professor. opened it
 with much impressment--assumed, of course--and showed great bundle of
 white flowers.
 
“these are for you, miss lucy,” said.
 
“for me? oh, dr. helsing!”
 
“yes, my dear, but not for you to play with. these are medicines.” here
 lucy made wry face. “nay, but they are not to take in decoction or
 in nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or i shall
 point out to my friend arthur what woes may have to endure in seeing
 so much beauty that so loves so much distort. aha, my pretty miss,
 that bring the so nice nose all straight again. this is medicinal, but
 you do not know how. i put him in your window, i make pretty wreath, and
 hang him round your neck, so that you sleep well. oh yes! they, like the
 lotus flower, make your trouble forgotten. it smell so like the waters
 of lethe, and of that fountain of youth that the conquistadores sought
 for in the floridas, and find him all too late.”
 
whilst was speaking, lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling
 them. now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter, and
 half-disgust:--
 
“oh, professor, i believe you are only putting up joke on me. why,
 these flowers are only common garlic.”
 
to my surprise, helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his
 iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--
 
“no trifling with me! i never jest! there is grim purpose in all i do;
 and i warn you that you do not thwart me. take care, for the sake of
 others if not for your own.” then seeing poor lucy scared, as she might
 well be, went on more gently: “oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear
 me. i only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so
 common flowers. see, i place them myself in your room. i make myself the
 wreath that you are to wear. but hush! telling to others that make so
 inquisitive questions. we must obey, and silence is part of obedience;
 and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait
 for you. now sit still awhile. come with me, friend john, and you shall
 help deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from haarlem,
 where my friend vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.
 i had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.”
 
we went into the room, taking the flowers with us. the professor’s
 actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia
 that i ever heard of. first fastened up the windows and latched them
 securely; next, taking handful of the flowers, rubbed them all over
 the sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get
 in would be laden with the garlic smell. then with the wisp rubbed
 all over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and round
 the fireplace in the same way. it all seemed grotesque to me, and
 presently i said:--
 
“well, professor, i know you always have reason for what you do, but
 this certainly puzzles me. it is well we have sceptic here, or he
 would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.”
 
“perhaps i am!” answered quietly as began to make the wreath which
 lucy was to wear round her neck.
 
we then waited whilst lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she
 was in bed came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her
 neck. the last words said to her were:--
 
“take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do
 not to-night open the window or the door.”
 
“i promise,” said lucy, “and thank you both thousand times for all
 your kindness to me! oh, what have i done to be blessed with such
 friends?”
 
as we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, helsing said:--
 
“to-night i can sleep in peace, and sleep i want--two nights of travel,
 much reading in the day between, and much anxiety on the day to follow,
 and night to sit up, without to wink. to-morrow in the morning early
 you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much
 more strong for my ‘spell’ which i have work. ho! ho!”
 
seemed so confident that i, remembering my own confidence two nights
 before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. it must
 have been my weakness that made hesitate to tell it to my friend, but
 i felt it all the more, like unshed tears.
 



chapter xi
 
_lucy westenra’s diary._
 

_12 september._--how good they all are to me. i quite love that dear dr.
 helsing. i wonder why was so anxious about these flowers. he
 positively frightened me, was so fierce. and yet must have been
 right, for i feel comfort from them already. somehow, i do not dread
 being alone to-night, and i can go to sleep without fear. i shall not
 mind any flapping outside the window. oh, the terrible struggle that i
 have had against sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness,
 or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such unknown horrors as it has
 for me! how blessed are some people, whose lives have fears, no
 dreads; to whom sleep is blessing that comes nightly, and brings
 nothing but sweet dreams. well, here i am to-night, hoping for sleep,
 and lying like ophelia in the play, with “virgin crants and maiden
 strewments.” i never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful!
 there is peace in its smell; i feel sleep coming already. good-night,
 everybody.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_13 september._--called at the berkeley and found helsing, as usual,
 up to time. the carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. the
 professor took his bag, which always brings with him now.
 
let all be put down exactly. helsing and i arrived at hillingham at
 eight o’clock. it was lovely morning; the bright sunshine and all the
 fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature’s
 annual work. the leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours,
 but had not yet begun to drop from the trees. when we entered we met
 mrs. westenra coming out of the morning room. she is always an early
 riser. she greeted us warmly and said:--
 
“you will be glad to know that lucy is better. the dear child is still
 asleep. i looked into her room and saw her, but did not go in, lest i
 should disturb her.” the professor smiled, and looked quite jubilant. he
 rubbed his hands together, and said:--
 
“aha! i thought i had diagnosed the case. my treatment is working,” to
 which she answered:--
 
“you must not take all the credit to yourself, doctor. lucy’s state this
 morning is due in part to me.”
 
“how you do mean, ma’am?” asked the professor.
 
“well, i was anxious about the dear child in the night, and went into
 her room. she was sleeping soundly--so soundly that even my coming did
 not wake her. but the room was awfully stuffy. there were lot of those
 horrible, strong-smelling flowers about everywhere, and she had actually
 bunch of them round her neck. i feared that the heavy odour would be
 too much for the dear child in her weak state, so i took them all away
 and opened bit of the window to let in little fresh air. you will be
 pleased with her, i am sure.”
 
she moved off into her boudoir, where she usually breakfasted early. as
 she had spoken, i watched the professor’s face, and saw it turn ashen
 grey. had been able to retain his self-command whilst the poor lady
 was present, for knew her state and how mischievous shock would be;
 actually smiled on her as held open the door for her to pass into
 her room. but the instant she had disappeared pulled me, suddenly and
 forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.
 
then, for the first time in my life, i saw helsing break down. he
 raised his hands over his head in sort of mute despair, and then beat
 his palms together in helpless way; finally sat down on chair,
 and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs
 that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. then raised
 his arms again, as though appealing to the whole universe. “god! god!
 god!” said. “what have we done, what has this poor thing done, that
 we are so sore beset? is there fate amongst us still, sent down from the
 pagan world of old, that such things must be, and in such way? this poor
 mother, all unknowing, and all for the best as she think, does such
 thing as lose her daughter body and soul; and we must not tell her, we
 must not even warn her, or she die, and then both die. oh, how we are
 beset! how are all the powers of the devils against us!” suddenly he
 jumped to his feet. “come,” said, “come, we must see and act. devils
 or devils, or all the devils at once, it matters not; we fight him
 all the same.” went to the hall-door for his bag; and together we
 went up to lucy’s room.
 
once again i drew up the blind, whilst helsing went towards the bed.
 this time did not start as looked on the poor face with the same
 awful, waxen pallor as before. wore look of stern sadness and
 infinite pity.
 
“as i expected,” murmured, with that hissing inspiration of his which
 meant so much. without word went and locked the door, and then
 began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another
 operation of transfusion of blood. i had long ago recognised the
 necessity, and begun to take off my coat, but stopped with a
 warning hand. “no!” said. “to-day you must operate. i shall provide.
 you are weakened already.” as spoke took off his coat and rolled
 up his shirt-sleeve.
 
again the operation; again the narcotic; again some return of colour to
 the ashy cheeks, and the regular breathing of healthy sleep. this time i
 watched whilst helsing recruited himself and rested.
 
presently took an opportunity of telling mrs. westenra that she must
 not remove anything from lucy’s room without consulting him; that the
 flowers were of medicinal value, and that the breathing of their odour
 was part of the system of cure. then took over the care of the case
 himself, saying that would watch this night and the next and would
 send word when to come.
 
after another hour lucy waked from her sleep, fresh and bright and
 seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal.
 
what does it all mean? i am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life
 amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.
 

_lucy westenra’s diary._
 
_17 september._--four days and nights of peace. i am getting so strong
 again that i hardly know myself. it is as if i had passed through some
 long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and
 feel the fresh air of the morning around me. i have dim
 half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness
 in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress
 more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to
 life as diver coming up through great press of water. since,
 however, dr. helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems
 to have passed away; the noises that used to frighten out of my
 wits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed
 so close to me, the harsh sounds that came from i know not where and
 commanded to do i know not what--have all ceased. i go to bed now
 without any fear of sleep. i do not even try to keep awake. i have grown
 quite fond of the garlic, and boxful arrives for every day from
 haarlem. to-night dr. helsing is going away, as has to be for a
 day in amsterdam. but i need not be watched; i am well enough to be left
 alone. thank god for mother’s sake, and dear arthur’s, and for all our
 friends who have been so kind! i shall not even feel the change, for
 last night dr. helsing slept in his chair lot of the time. i found
 him asleep twice when i awoke; but i did not fear to go to sleep again,
 although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against
 the window-panes.
 

_“the pall mall gazette,” 18 september._
 
the escaped wolf.
 
perilous adventure of our interviewer.
 
_interview with the keeper in the zoölogical gardens._
 
after many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using
 the words “pall mall gazette” as sort of talisman, i managed to find
 the keeper of the section of the zoölogical gardens in which the wolf
 department is included. thomas bilder lives in one of the cottages in
 the enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to
 his tea when i found him. thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,
 elderly, and without children, and if the specimen i enjoyed of their
 hospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty
 comfortable. the keeper would not enter on what called “business”
 until the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. then when the
 table was cleared, and had lit his pipe, said:--
 
“now, sir, you can go on and arsk what you want. you’ll excoose me
 refoosin’ to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. i gives the
 wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore
 i begins to arsk them questions.”
 
“how do you mean, ask them questions?” i queried, wishful to get him
 into talkative humour.
 
“’ittin’ of them over the ’ead with pole is one way; scratchin’ of
 their hears is another, when gents as is flush wants bit of show-orf
 to their gals. i don’t so much mind the fust--the ’ittin’ with pole
 afore i chucks in their dinner; but i waits till they’ve ’ad their
 sherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore i tries on with the
 ear-scratchin’. mind you,” added philosophically, “there’s deal of
 the same nature in us as in them theer animiles. here’s you a-comin’ and
 arskin’ of questions about my business, and i that grumpy-like that
 only for your bloomin’ ’arf-quid i’d ’a’ seen you blowed fust ’fore i’d
 answer. not even when you arsked sarcastic-like if i’d like you to
 arsk the superintendent if you might arsk questions. without offence
 did i tell yer to go to ’ell?”
 
“you did.”
 
“an’ when you said you’d report for usin’ of obscene language that
 was ’ittin’ over the ’ead; but the ’arf-quid made that all right. i
 weren’t a-goin’ to fight, so i waited for the food, and did with my ’owl
 as the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. but, lor’ love yer ’art, now
 that the old ’ooman has stuck chunk of her tea-cake in me, an’ rinsed
 out with her bloomin’ old teapot, and i’ve lit hup, you may scratch
 my ears for all you’re worth, and won’t git even growl out of me.
 drive along with your questions. i know what yer a-comin’ at, that ’ere
 escaped wolf.”
 
“exactly. i want you to give your view of it. just tell how it
 happened; and when i know the facts i’ll get you to say what you
 consider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will
 end.”
 
“all right, guv’nor. this ’ere is about the ’ole story. that ’ere wolf
 what we called bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from
 norway to jamrach’s, which we bought off him four years ago. was a
 nice well-behaved wolf, that never gave trouble to talk of. i’m more
 surprised at ’im for wantin’ to get out nor any other animile in the
 place. but, there, you can’t trust wolves more nor women.”
 
“don’t you mind him, sir!” broke in mrs. tom, with cheery laugh. “’e’s
 got mindin’ the animiles so long that blest if ain’t like old wolf
 ’isself! but there ain’t ’arm in ’im.”
 
“well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin’ yesterday when i first
 hear my disturbance. i was makin’ up litter in the monkey-house for a
 young puma which is ill; but when i heard the yelpin’ and ’owlin’ i kem
 away straight. there was bersicker a-tearin’ like mad thing at the
 bars as if wanted to get out. there wasn’t much people about that
 day, and close at hand was only one man, tall, thin chap, with ’ook
 nose and pointed beard, with few white hairs runnin’ through it. he
 had ’ard, cold look and red eyes, and i took sort of mislike to him,
 for it seemed as if it was ’im as they was hirritated at. ’ad white
 kid gloves on ’is ’ands, and pointed out the animiles to and says:
 ‘keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.’
 
“‘maybe it’s you,’ says i, for i did not like the airs as give
 ’isself. didn’t git angry, as i ’oped would, but smiled kind
 of insolent smile, with mouth full of white, sharp teeth. ‘oh no, they
 wouldn’t like me,’ ’e says.
 
“‘ow yes, they would,’ says i, a-imitatin’ of him. ‘they always likes a
 bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you ’as a
 bagful.’
 
“well, it was odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin’ they
 lay down, and when i went over to bersicker let stroke his ears
 same as ever. that there man kem over, and blessed but if didn’t put
 in his hand and stroke the old wolf’s ears too!
 
“‘tyke care,’ says i. ‘bersicker is quick.’
 
“‘never mind,’ says. ‘i’m used to ’em!’
 
“‘are you in the business yourself?’ i says, tyking off my ’at, for a
 man what trades in wolves, anceterer, is good friend to keepers.
 
“‘no,’ says he, ‘not exactly in the business, but i ’ave made pets of
 several.’ and with that lifts his ’at as perlite as lord, and walks
 away. old bersicker kep’ a-lookin’ arter ’im till ’e was out of sight,
 and then went and lay down in corner and wouldn’t come hout the ’ole
 hevening. well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves
 here all began a-’owling. there warn’t nothing for them to ’owl at.
 there warn’t one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin’ a
 dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the park road. once or twice
 i went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the ’owling
 stopped. just before twelve o’clock i just took look round afore
 turnin’ in, an’, bust me, but when i kem opposite to old bersicker’s
 cage i see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. and
 that’s all i know for certing.”
 
“did any one else see anything?”
 
“one of our gard’ners was a-comin’ ’ome about that time from ’armony,
 when sees big grey dog comin’ out through the garding ’edges. at
 least, so says, but i don’t give much for it myself, for if did ’e
 never said word about it to his missis when ’e got ’ome, and it was
 only after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all
 night-a-huntin’ of the park for bersicker, that remembered seein’
 anything. my own belief was that the ’armony ’ad got into his ’ead.”
 
“now, mr. bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the
 wolf?”
 
“well, sir,” said, with suspicious sort of modesty, “i think i can;
 but i don’t know as ’ow you’d be satisfied with the theory.”
 
“certainly i shall. if man like you, who knows the animals from
 experience, can’t hazard good guess at any rate, who is even to try?”
 
“well then, sir, i accounts for it this way; it seems to that ’ere
 wolf escaped--simply because wanted to get out.”
 
from the hearty way that both thomas and his wife laughed at the joke i
 could see that it had done service before, and that the whole
 explanation was simply an elaborate sell. i couldn’t cope in badinage
 with the worthy thomas, but i thought i knew surer way to his heart,
 so i said:--
 
“now, mr. bilder, we’ll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,
 and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you’ve told me
 what you think will happen.”
 
“right y’are, sir,” said briskly. “ye’ll excoose me, i know, for
 a-chaffin’ of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much
 as telling to go on.”
 
“well, i never!” said the old lady.
 
“my opinion is this: that ’ere wolf is a-’idin’ of, somewheres. the
 gard’ner wot didn’t remember said was a-gallopin’ northward faster
 than horse could go; but i don’t believe him, for, yer see, sir,
 wolves don’t gallop more nor dogs does, they not bein’ built that
 way. wolves is fine things in storybook, and i dessay when they gets
 in packs and does be chivyin’ somethin’ that’s more afeared than they is
 they can make devil of noise and chop it up, whatever it is. but,
 lor’ bless you, in real life wolf is only low creature, not half so
 clever or bold as good dog; and not half quarter so much fight in
 ’im. this one ain’t been used to fightin’ or even to providin’ for
 hisself, and more like he’s somewhere round the park a-’idin’ an’
 a-shiverin’ of, and, if thinks at all, wonderin’ where is to get
 his breakfast from; or maybe he’s got down some area and is in a
 coal-cellar. my eye, won’t some cook get rum start when she sees his
 green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! if can’t get food he’s
 bound to look for it, and mayhap may chance to light on butcher’s
 shop in time. if doesn’t, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin’ orf with
 soldier, leavin’ of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then i
 shouldn’t be surprised if the census is one babby the less. that’s
 all.”
 
i was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up
 against the window, and mr. bilder’s face doubled its natural length
 with surprise.
 
“god bless me!” said. “if there ain’t old bersicker come back by
 ’isself!”
 
went to the door and opened it; most unnecessary proceeding it
 seemed to me. i have always thought that wild animal never looks so
 well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a
 personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.
 
after all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither bilder nor
 his wife thought any more of the wolf than i should of dog. the animal
 itself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all
 picture-wolves--red riding hood’s quondam friend, whilst moving her
 confidence in masquerade.
 
the whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. the
 wicked wolf that for half day had paralysed london and set all the
 children in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in sort of
 penitent mood, and was received and petted like sort of vulpine
 prodigal son. old bilder examined him all over with most tender
 solicitude, and when had finished with his penitent said:--
 
“there, i knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;
 didn’t i say it all along? here’s his head all cut and full of broken
 glass. ’e’s been a-gettin’ over some bloomin’ wall or other. it’s a
 shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.
 this ’ere’s what comes of it. come along, bersicker.”
 
took the wolf and locked him up in cage, with piece of meat that
 satisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the
 fatted calf, and went off to report.
 
i came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given
 to-day regarding the strange escapade at the zoo.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_17 september._--i was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my
 books, which, through press of other work and the many visits to lucy,
 had fallen sadly into arrear. suddenly the door was burst open, and in
 rushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. i was
 thunderstruck, for such thing as patient getting of his own accord
 into the superintendent’s study is almost unknown. without an instant’s
 pause made straight at me. had dinner-knife in his hand, and,
 as i saw was dangerous, i tried to keep the table between us. was
 too quick and too strong for me, however; for before i could get my
 balance had struck at and cut my left wrist rather severely.
 before could strike again, however, i got in my right and was
 sprawling on his back on the floor. my wrist bled freely, and quite a
 little pool trickled on to the carpet. i saw that my friend was not
 intent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,
 keeping wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. when the
 attendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment
 positively sickened me. was lying on his belly on the floor licking
 up, like dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. was
 easily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite
 placidly, simply repeating over and over again: “the blood is the life!
 the blood is the life!”
 
i cannot afford to lose blood just at present; i have lost too much of
 late for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of lucy’s
 illness and its horrible phases is telling on me. i am over-excited and
 weary, and i need rest, rest, rest. happily helsing has not summoned
 me, so i need not forego my sleep; to-night i could not well do without
 it.
 

_telegram, helsing, antwerp, to seward, carfax._
 
(sent to carfax, sussex, as county given; delivered late by
 twenty-two hours.)
 
“_17 september._--do not fail to be at hillingham to-night. if not
 watching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as
 placed; very important; do not fail. shall be with you as soon as
 possible after arrival.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_18 september._--just off for train to london. the arrival of van
 helsing’s telegram filled with dismay. whole night lost, and i know
 by bitter experience what may happen in night. of course it is
 possible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? surely
 there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident
 should thwart us in all we try to do. i shall take this cylinder with
 me, and then i can complete my entry on lucy’s phonograph.
 

_memorandum left by lucy westenra._
 
_17 september. night._--i write this and leave it to be seen, so that no
 one may by any chance get into trouble through me. this is an exact
 record of what took place to-night. i feel i am dying of weakness, and
 have barely strength to write, but it must be done if i die in the
 doing.
 
i went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as dr.
 helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.
 
i was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that
 sleep-walking on the cliff at whitby when mina saved me, and which now i
 know so well. i was not afraid, but i did wish that dr. seward was in
 the next room--as dr. helsing said would be--so that i might have
 called him. i tried to go to sleep, but could not. then there came to me
 the old fear of sleep, and i determined to keep awake. perversely sleep
 would try to come then when i did not want it; so, as i feared to be
 alone, i opened my door and called out: “is there anybody there?” there
 was answer. i was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.
 then outside in the shrubbery i heard sort of howl like dog’s, but
 more fierce and deeper. i went to the window and looked out, but could
 see nothing, except big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its
 wings against the window. so i went back to bed again, but determined
 not to go to sleep. presently the door opened, and mother looked in;
 seeing by my moving that i was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. she
 said to even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--
 
“i was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all
 right.”
 
i feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in
 and sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did
 not take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay while
 and then go back to her own bed. as she lay there in my arms, and i in
 hers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. she was
 startled and little frightened, and cried out: “what is that?” i tried
 to pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but i could
 hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. after while there was
 the low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a
 crash at the window, and lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.
 the window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the
 aperture of the broken panes there was the head of great, gaunt grey
 wolf. mother cried out in fright, and struggled up into sitting
 posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. amongst
 other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that dr. helsing
 insisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. for a
 second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was strange
 and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck
 with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made dizzy for a
 moment or two. the room and all round seemed to spin round. i kept my
 eyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and whole
 myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken
 window, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that
 travellers describe when there is simoon in the desert. i tried to
 stir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother’s poor body,
 which seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to
 beat--weighed down; and i remembered more for while.
 
the time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till i recovered
 consciousness again. somewhere near, passing bell was tolling; the
 dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,
 seemingly just outside, nightingale was singing. i was dazed and
 stupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the
 nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort
 me. the sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for i could hear
 their bare feet pattering outside my door. i called to them, and they
 came in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay
 over on the bed, they screamed out. the wind rushed in through the
 broken window, and the door slammed to. they lifted off the body of my
 dear mother, and laid her, covered up with sheet, on the bed after i
 had got up. they were all so frightened and nervous that i directed them
 to go to the dining-room and have each glass of wine. the door flew
 open for an instant and closed again. the maids shrieked, and then went
 in body to the dining-room; and i laid what flowers i had on my dear
 mother’s breast. when they were there i remembered what dr. helsing
 had told me, but i didn’t like to remove them, and, besides, i would
 have some of the servants to sit up with now. i was surprised that
 the maids did not come back. i called them, but got answer, so i went
 to the dining-room to look for them.
 
my heart sank when i saw what had happened. they all four lay helpless
 on the floor, breathing heavily. the decanter of sherry was on the table
 half full, but there was queer, acrid smell about. i was suspicious,
 and examined the decanter. it smelt of laudanum, and looking on the
 sideboard, i found that the bottle which mother’s doctor uses for
 her--oh! did use--was empty. what am i to do? what am i to do? i am back
 in the room with mother. i cannot leave her, and i am alone, save for
 the sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. alone with the dead! i
 dare not go out, for i can hear the low howl of the wolf through the
 broken window.
 
the air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from
 the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. what am i to do? god
 shield from harm this night! i shall hide this paper in my breast,
 where they shall find it when they come to lay out. my dear mother
 gone! it is time that i go too. good-bye, dear arthur, if i should not
 survive this night. god keep you, dear, and god help me!
 



chapter xii
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_18 september._--i drove at once to hillingham and arrived early.
 keeping my cab at the gate, i went up the avenue alone. i knocked gently
 and rang as quietly as possible, for i feared to disturb lucy or her
 mother, and hoped to only bring servant to the door. after while,
 finding response, i knocked and rang again; still answer. i cursed
 the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an
 hour--for it was now ten o’clock--and so rang and knocked again, but
 more impatiently, but still without response. hitherto i had blamed only
 the servants, but now terrible fear began to assail me. was this
 desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing
 tight around us? was it indeed house of death to which i had come, too
 late? i knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of
 danger to lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;
 and i went round the house to try if i could find by chance an entry
 anywhere.
 
i could find means of ingress. every window and door was fastened and
 locked, and i returned baffled to the porch. as i did so, i heard the
 rapid pit-pat of swiftly driven horse’s feet. they stopped at the
 gate, and few seconds later i met helsing running up the avenue.
 when saw me, gasped out:--
 
“then it was you, and just arrived. how is she? are we too late? did you
 not get my telegram?”
 
i answered as quickly and coherently as i could that i had only got his
 telegram early in the morning, and had not lost minute in coming here,
 and that i could not make any one in the house hear me. paused and
 raised his hat as said solemnly:--
 
“then i fear we are too late. god’s will be done!” with his usual
 recuperative energy, went on: “come. if there be way open to get
 in, we must make one. time is all in all to us now.”
 
we went round to the back of the house, where there was kitchen
 window. the professor took small surgical saw from his case, and
 handing it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. i
 attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. then
 with long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and
 opened the window. i helped the professor in, and followed him. there
 was one in the kitchen or in the servants’ rooms, which were close at
 hand. we tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,
 dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four
 servant-women lying on the floor. there was need to think them dead,
 for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the
 room left doubt as to their condition. helsing and i looked at
 each other, and as we moved away said: “we can attend to them later.”
 then we ascended to lucy’s room. for an instant or two we paused at the
 door to listen, but there was sound that we could hear. with white
 faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the
 room.
 
how shall i describe what we saw? on the bed lay two women, lucy and her
 mother. the latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with white
 sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the
 broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with look of terror
 fixed upon it. by her side lay lucy, with face white and still more
 drawn. the flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her
 mother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds
 which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.
 without word the professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching
 poor lucy’s breast; then gave quick turn of his head, as of one who
 listens, and leaping to his feet, cried out to me:--
 
“it is not yet too late! quick! quick! bring the brandy!”
 
i flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste
 it, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which i found
 on the table. the maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and i
 fancied that the narcotic was wearing off. i did not stay to make sure,
 but returned to helsing. rubbed the brandy, as on another
 occasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her
 hands. said to me:--
 
“i can do this, all that can be at the present. you go wake those maids.
 flick them in the face with wet towel, and flick them hard. make them
 get heat and fire and warm bath. this poor soul is nearly as cold as
 that beside her. she will need be heated before we can do anything
 more.”
 
i went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the
 women. the fourth was only young girl, and the drug had evidently
 affected her more strongly, so i lifted her on the sofa and let her
 sleep. the others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to
 them they cried and sobbed in hysterical manner. i was stern with
 them, however, and would not let them talk. i told them that one life
 was bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice
 miss lucy. so, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad
 as they were, and prepared fire and water. fortunately, the kitchen and
 boiler fires were still alive, and there was lack of hot water. we
 got bath and carried lucy out as she was and placed her in it. whilst
 we were busy chafing her limbs there was knock at the hall door. one
 of the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. then
 she returned and whispered to us that there was gentleman who had come
 with message from mr. holmwood. i bade her simply tell him that he
 must wait, for we could see one now. she went away with the message,
 and, engrossed with our work, i clean forgot all about him.
 
i never saw in all my experience the professor work in such deadly
 earnest. i knew--as knew--that it was stand-up fight with death,
 and in pause told him so. answered in way that i did not
 understand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--
 
“if that were all, i would stop here where we are now, and let her fade
 away into peace, for i see light in life over her horizon.” went
 on with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.
 
presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to
 be of some effect. lucy’s heart beat trifle more audibly to the
 stethoscope, and her lungs had perceptible movement. helsing’s
 face almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in
 hot sheet to dry her said to me:--
 
“the first gain is ours! check to the king!”
 
we took lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid
 her in bed and forced few drops of brandy down her throat. i noticed
 that helsing tied soft silk handkerchief round her throat. she was
 still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had
 ever seen her.
 
helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her
 and not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me
 out of the room.
 
“we must consult as to what is to be done,” said as we descended the
 stairs. in the hall opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he
 closing the door carefully behind him. the shutters had been opened, but
 the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of
 death which the british woman of the lower classes always rigidly
 observes. the room was, therefore, dimly dark. it was, however, light
 enough for our purposes. helsing’s sternness was somewhat relieved
 by look of perplexity. was evidently torturing his mind about
 something, so i waited for an instant, and spoke:--
 
“what are we to do now? where are we to turn for help? we must have
 another transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl’s life
 won’t be worth an hour’s purchase. you are exhausted already; i am
 exhausted too. i fear to trust those women, even if they would have
 courage to submit. what are we to do for some one who will open his
 veins for her?”
 
“what’s the matter with me, anyhow?”
 
the voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought
 relief and joy to my heart, for they were those of quincey morris. van
 helsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a
 glad look came into his eyes as i cried out: “quincey morris!” and
 rushed towards him with outstretched hands.
 
“what brought you here?” i cried as our hands met.
 
“i guess art is the cause.”
 
handed telegram:--
 
“have not heard from seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.
 cannot leave. father still in same condition. send word how lucy is.
 do not delay.--holmwood.”
 
“i think i came just in the nick of time. you know you have only to tell
 what to do.”
 
helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in
 the eyes as said:--
 
“a brave man’s blood is the best thing on this earth when woman is in
 trouble. you’re man and mistake. well, the devil may work against
 us for all he’s worth, but god sends us men when we want them.”
 
once again we went through that ghastly operation. i have not the heart
 to go through with the details. lucy had got terrible shock and it
 told on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her
 veins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other
 occasions. her struggle back into life was something frightful to see
 and hear. however, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and van
 helsing made subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with
 good effect. her faint became profound slumber. the professor watched
 whilst i went downstairs with quincey morris, and sent one of the maids
 to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. i left quincey lying down
 after having glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready good
 breakfast. then thought struck me, and i went back to the room where
 lucy now was. when i came softly in, i found helsing with sheet or
 two of note-paper in his hand. had evidently read it, and was
 thinking it over as sat with his hand to his brow. there was look
 of grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had doubt solved.
 handed the paper saying only: “it dropped from lucy’s breast when
 we carried her to the bath.”
 
when i had read it, i stood looking at the professor, and after pause
 asked him: “in god’s name, what does it all mean? was she, or is she,
 mad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?” i was so bewildered that i
 did not know what to say more. helsing put out his hand and took the
 paper, saying:--
 
“do not trouble about it now. forget it for the present. you shall know
 and understand it all in good time; but it will be later. and now what
 is it that you came to to say?” this brought back to fact, and i
 was all myself again.
 
“i came to speak about the certificate of death. if we do not act
 properly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have
 to be produced. i am in hopes that we need have inquest, for if we
 had it would surely kill poor lucy, if nothing else did. i know, and you
 know, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that mrs. westenra
 had disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. let us
 fill up the certificate at once, and i shall take it myself to the
 registrar and go on to the undertaker.”
 
“good, oh my friend john! well thought of! truly miss lucy, if she be
 sad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that
 love her. one, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old
 man. ah yes, i know, friend john; i am not blind! i love you all the
 more for it! now go.”
 
in the hall i met quincey morris, with telegram for arthur telling him
 that mrs. westenra was dead; that lucy also had been ill, but was now
 going on better; and that helsing and i were with her. i told him
 where i was going, and hurried out, but as i was going said:--
 
“when you come back, jack, may i have two words with you all to
 ourselves?” i nodded in reply and went out. i found difficulty about
 the registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in
 the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.
 
when i got back quincey was waiting for me. i told him i would see him
 as soon as i knew about lucy, and went up to her room. she was still
 sleeping, and the professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her
 side. from his putting his finger to his lips, i gathered that he
 expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.
 so i went down to quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where
 the blinds were not drawn down, and which was little more cheerful, or
 rather less cheerless, than the other rooms. when we were alone, said
 to me:--
 
“jack seward, i don’t want to shove myself in anywhere where i’ve no
 right to be; but this is ordinary case. you know i loved that girl
 and wanted to marry her; but, although that’s all past and gone, i can’t
 help feeling anxious about her all the same. what is it that’s wrong
 with her? the dutchman--and fine old fellow is; i can see
 that--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have
 _another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and were exhausted.
 now i know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that man
 must not expect to know what they consult about in private. but this is
 common matter, and, whatever it is, i have done my part. is not that
 so?”
 
“that’s so,” i said, and went on:--
 
“i take it that both you and helsing had done already what i did
 to-day. is not that so?”
 
“that’s so.”
 
“and i guess art was in it too. when i saw him four days ago down at his
 own place looked queer. i have not seen anything pulled down so quick
 since i was on the pampas and had mare that i was fond of go to grass
 all in night. one of those big bats that they call vampires had got at
 her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there
 wasn’t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and i had to put a
 bullet through her as she lay. jack, if you may tell without
 betraying confidence, arthur was the first, is not that so?” as spoke
 the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. was in torture of suspense
 regarding the woman loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible
 mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. his very
 heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a
 royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. i paused before
 answering, for i felt that i must not betray anything which the
 professor wished kept secret; but already knew so much, and guessed
 so much, that there could be reason for not answering, so i answered
 in the same phrase: “that’s so.”
 
“and how long has this been going on?”
 
“about ten days.”
 
“ten days! then i guess, jack seward, that that poor pretty creature
 that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood
 of four strong men. man alive, her whole body wouldn’t hold it.” then,
 coming close to me, spoke in fierce half-whisper: “what took it
 out?”
 
i shook my head. “that,” i said, “is the crux. helsing is simply
 frantic about it, and i am at my wits’ end. i can’t even hazard guess.
 there has been series of little circumstances which have thrown out
 all our calculations as to lucy being properly watched. but these shall
 not occur again. here we stay until all be well--or ill.” quincey held
 out his hand. “count in,” said. “you and the dutchman will tell me
 what to do, and i’ll do it.”
 
when she woke late in the afternoon, lucy’s first movement was to feel
 in her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which helsing
 had given to read. the careful professor had replaced it where it had
 come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. her eye then lit on van
 helsing and on too, and gladdened. then she looked around the room,
 and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave loud cry, and put her
 poor thin hands before her pale face. we both understood what that
 meant--that she had realised to the full her mother’s death; so we tried
 what we could to comfort her. doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but
 she was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for
 long time. we told her that either or both of us would now remain with
 her all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. towards dusk she fell
 into doze. here very odd thing occurred. whilst still asleep she
 took the paper from her breast and tore it in two. helsing stepped
 over and took the pieces from her. all the same, however, she went on
 with the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her
 hands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering
 the fragments. helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as
 if in thought, but said nothing.
 
* * * * *
 
_19 september._--all last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid
 to sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. the professor and
 i took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for moment
 unattended. quincey morris said nothing about his intention, but i knew
 that all night long patrolled round and round the house.
 
when the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor lucy’s
 strength. she was hardly able to turn her head, and the little
 nourishment which she could take seemed to do her good. at times she
 slept, and both helsing and i noticed the difference in her, between
 sleeping and waking. whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more
 haggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale
 gums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and
 sharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently
 changed the expression, for she looked her own self, although dying
 one. in the afternoon she asked for arthur, and we telegraphed for him.
 quincey went off to meet him at the station.
 
when arrived it was nearly six o’clock, and the sun was setting full
 and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more
 colour to the pale cheeks. when saw her, arthur was simply choking
 with emotion, and none of us could speak. in the hours that had passed,
 the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had
 grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible
 were shortened. arthur’s presence, however, seemed to act as a
 stimulant; she rallied little, and spoke to him more brightly than she
 had done since we arrived. too pulled himself together, and spoke as
 cheerily as could, so that the best was made of everything.
 
it was now nearly one o’clock, and and helsing are sitting with
 her. i am to relieve them in quarter of an hour, and i am entering
 this on lucy’s phonograph. until six o’clock they are to try to rest. i
 fear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too
 great; the poor child cannot rally. god help us all.
 

_letter, mina harker to lucy westenra._
 
(unopened by her.)
 
“_17 september._
 
“my dearest lucy,--
 
“it seems _an age_ since i heard from you, or indeed since i wrote. you
 will pardon me, i know, for all my faults when you have read all my
 budget of news. well, i got my husband back all right; when we arrived
 at exeter there was carriage waiting for us, and in it, though had
 an attack of gout, mr. hawkins. took us to his house, where there
 were rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. after
 dinner mr. hawkins said:--
 
“‘my dears, i want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every
 blessing attend you both. i know you both from children, and have, with
 love and pride, seen you grow up. now i want you to make your home here
 with me. i have left to neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in
 my will i have left you everything.’ i cried, lucy dear, as jonathan and
 the old man clasped hands. our evening was very, very happy one.
 
“so here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my
 bedroom and the drawing-room i can see the great elms of the cathedral
 close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow
 stone of the cathedral and i can hear the rooks overhead cawing and
 cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of
 rooks--and humans. i am busy, i need not tell you, arranging things and
 housekeeping. jonathan and mr. hawkins are busy all day; for, now that
 jonathan is partner, mr. hawkins wants to tell him all about the
 clients.
 
“how is your dear mother getting on? i wish i could run up to town for a
 day or two to see you, dear, but i dare not go yet, with so much on my
 shoulders; and jonathan wants looking after still. is beginning to
 put some flesh on his bones again, but was terribly weakened by the
 long illness; even now sometimes starts out of his sleep in sudden
 way and awakes all trembling until i can coax him back to his usual
 placidity. however, thank god, these occasions grow less frequent as the
 days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, i trust. and now
 i have told you my news, let ask yours. when are you to be married,
 and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,
 and is it to be public or private wedding? tell all about it,
 dear; tell all about everything, for there is nothing which interests
 you which will not be dear to me. jonathan asks to send his
 ‘respectful duty,’ but i do not think that is good enough from the
 junior partner of the important firm hawkins & harker; and so, as you
 love me, and loves me, and i love you with all the moods and tenses
 of the verb, i send you simply his ‘love’ instead. good-bye, my dearest
 lucy, and all blessings on you.
 
“yours,
 
“mina harker.”

“_20 september._
 
“my dear sir,--
 
“in accordance with your wishes, i enclose report of the conditions of
 everything left in my charge.... with regard to patient, renfield, there
 is more to say. has had another outbreak, which might have had a
 dreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended
 with any unhappy results. this afternoon carrier’s cart with two men
 made call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to
 which, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. the men stopped at
 our gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. i was
 myself looking out of the study window, having smoke after dinner, and
 saw one of them come up to the house. as passed the window of
 renfield’s room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called
 him all the foul names could lay his tongue to. the man, who seemed a
 decent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to “shut up for a
 foul-mouthed beggar,” whereon our man accused him of robbing him and
 wanting to murder him and said that would hinder him if were to
 swing for it. i opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,
 so contented himself after looking the place over and making up his
 mind as to what kind of place had got to by saying: ‘lor’ bless
 yer, sir, i wouldn’t mind what was said to in bloomin’ madhouse. i
 pity ye and the guv’nor for havin’ to live in the house with wild
 beast like that.’ then asked his way civilly enough, and i told him
 where the gate of the empty house was; went away, followed by threats
 and curses and revilings from our man. i went down to see if i could
 make out any cause for his anger, since is usually such a
 well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had
 ever occurred. i found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most
 genial in his manner. i tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he
 blandly asked questions as to what i meant, and led to believe
 that was completely oblivious of the affair. it was, i am sorry to
 say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an
 hour i heard of him again. this time had broken out through the
 window of his room, and was running down the avenue. i called to the
 attendants to follow me, and ran after him, for i feared was intent
 on some mischief. my fear was justified when i saw the same cart which
 had passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden
 boxes. the men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the
 face, as if with violent exercise. before i could get up to him the
 patient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to
 knock his head against the ground. if i had not seized him just at the
 moment i believe would have killed the man there and then. the other
 fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his
 heavy whip. it was terrible blow; but did not seem to mind it, but
 seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and
 fro as if we were kittens. you know i am light weight, and the others
 were both burly men. at first was silent in his fighting; but as we
 began to master him, and the attendants were putting strait-waistcoat
 on him, began to shout: ‘i’ll frustrate them! they shan’t rob me!
 they shan’t murder by inches! i’ll fight for my lord and master!’ and
 all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. it was with very considerable
 difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded
 room. one of the attendants, hardy, had finger broken. however, i set
 it all right; and is going on well.
 
“the two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for
 damages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. their
 threats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for
 the defeat of the two of them by feeble madman. they said that if it
 had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and
 raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of
 him. they gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary
 state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of
 their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their
 labours of any place of public entertainment. i quite understood their
 drift, and after stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and
 with each sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore
 that they would encounter worse madman any day for the pleasure of
 meeting so ‘bloomin’ good bloke’ as your correspondent. i took their
 names and addresses, in case they might be needed. they are as
 follows:--jack smollet, of dudding’s rents, king george’s road, great
 walworth, and thomas snelling, peter farley’s row, guide court, bethnal
 green. they are both in the employment of harris & sons, moving and
 shipment company, orange master’s yard, soho.
 
“i shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall
 wire you at once if there is anything of importance.

“_18 september._
 
“my dearest lucy,--
 
“such sad blow has befallen us. mr. hawkins has died very suddenly.
 some may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him
 that it really seems as though we had lost father. i never knew either
 father or mother, so that the dear old man’s death is real blow to me.
 jonathan is greatly distressed. it is not only that feels sorrow,
 deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,
 and now at the end has treated him like his own and left him a
 fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the
 dream of avarice, but jonathan feels it on another account. says the
 amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. he
 begins to doubt himself. i try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_
 helps him to have belief in himself. but it is here that the grave
 shock that experienced tells upon him the most. oh, it is too hard
 that sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which
 enabled him by our dear, good friend’s aid to rise from clerk to master
 in few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its
 strength is gone. forgive me, dear, if i worry you with my troubles in
 the midst of your own happiness; but, lucy dear, i must tell some one,
 for the strain of keeping up brave and cheerful appearance to jonathan
 tries me, and i have one here that i can confide in. i dread coming
 up to london, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor mr.
 hawkins left in his will that was to be buried in the grave with his
 father. as there are relations at all, jonathan will have to be chief
 mourner. i shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for few
 minutes. forgive for troubling you. with all blessings,
 
“your loving
 
“mina harker.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_20 september._--only resolution and habit can let make an entry
 to-night. i am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world
 and all in it, including life itself, that i would not care if i heard
 this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death. and has
 been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--lucy’s mother
 and arthur’s father, and now.... let get on with my work.
 
i duly relieved helsing in his watch over lucy. we wanted arthur to
 go to rest also, but refused at first. it was only when i told him
 that we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not
 all break down for want of rest, lest lucy should suffer, that agreed
 to go. helsing was very kind to him. “come, my child,” said;
 “come with me. you are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much
 mental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of. you
 must not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.
 come to the drawing-room, where there is big fire, and there are two
 sofas. you shall lie on one, and i on the other, and our sympathy will
 be comfort to each other, even though we do not speak, and even if we
 sleep.” arthur went off with him, casting back longing look on lucy’s
 face, which lay in her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn. she lay
 quite still, and i looked round the room to see that all was as it
 should be. i could see that the professor had carried out in this room,
 as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of the
 window-sashes reeked with it, and round lucy’s neck, over the silk
 handkerchief which helsing made her keep on, was rough chaplet of
 the same odorous flowers. lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and
 her face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums. her
 teeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they
 had been in the morning. in particular, by some trick of the light, the
 canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest. i sat down by her,
 and presently she moved uneasily. at the same moment there came sort
 of dull flapping or buffeting at the window. i went over to it softly,
 and peeped out by the corner of the blind. there was full moonlight,
 and i could see that the noise was made by great bat, which wheeled
 round--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every now
 and again struck the window with its wings. when i came back to my seat,
 i found that lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic
 flowers from her throat. i replaced them as well as i could, and sat
 watching her.
 
presently she woke, and i gave her food, as helsing had prescribed.
 she took but little, and that languidly. there did not seem to be with
 her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto
 so marked her illness. it struck as curious that the moment she
 became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her. it was
 certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the
 stertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she
 waked she clutched them close. there was possibility of making any
 mistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many
 spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times.
 
at six o’clock helsing came to relieve me. arthur had then fallen
 into doze, and mercifully let him sleep on. when saw lucy’s face
 i could hear the sissing indraw of his breath, and said to in a
 sharp whisper: “draw up the blind; i want light!” then bent down,
 and, with his face almost touching lucy’s, examined her carefully. he
 removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat. as
 did so started back, and i could hear his ejaculation, “mein
 gott!” as it was smothered in his throat. i bent over and looked, too,
 and as i noticed some queer chill came over me.
 
the wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.
 
for fully five minutes helsing stood looking at her, with his face
 at its sternest. then turned to and said calmly:--
 
“she is dying. it will not be long now. it will be much difference, mark
 me, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep. wake that poor boy, and
 let him come and see the last; trusts us, and we have promised him.”
 
i went to the dining-room and waked him. was dazed for moment, but
 when saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters
 thought was late, and expressed his fear. i assured him that lucy
 was still asleep, but told him as gently as i could that both van
 helsing and i feared that the end was near. covered his face with his
 hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where remained,
 perhaps minute, with his head buried, praying, whilst his shoulders
 shook with grief. i took him by the hand and raised him up. “come,” i
 said, “my dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude: it will be best
 and easiest for her.”
 
when we came into lucy’s room i could see that helsing had, with
 his usual forethought, been putting matters straight and making
 everything look as pleasing as possible. had even brushed lucy’s
 hair, so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples. when we
 came into the room she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered
 softly:--
 
“arthur! oh, my love, i am so glad you have come!” was stooping to
 kiss her, when helsing motioned him back. “no,” whispered, “not
 yet! hold her hand; it will comfort her more.”
 
so arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,
 with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes. then
 gradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep. for little bit her
 breast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like tired child’s.
 
and then insensibly there came the strange change which i had noticed in
 the night. her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale
 gums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever. in a
 sort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which
 were now dull and hard at once, and said in soft, voluptuous voice,
 such as i had never heard from her lips:--
 
“arthur! oh, my love, i am so glad you have come! kiss me!” arthur bent
 eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant helsing, who, like me,
 had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by
 the neck with both hands, dragged him back with fury of strength which
 i never thought could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost
 across the room.
 
“not for your life!” said; “not for your living soul and hers!” and
 stood between them like lion at bay.
 
arthur was so taken aback that did not for moment know what to do
 or say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him realised
 the place and the occasion, and stood silent, waiting.
 
i kept my eyes fixed on lucy, as did helsing, and we saw spasm as
 of rage flit like shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed
 together. then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.
 
very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and
 putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took helsing’s great brown
 one; drawing it to her, she kissed it. “my true friend,” she said, in a
 faint voice, but with untellable pathos, “my true friend, and his! oh,
 guard him, and give peace!”
 
“i swear it!” said solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his
 hand, as one who registers an oath. then turned to arthur, and said
 to him: “come, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the
 forehead, and only once.”
 
their eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.
 
lucy’s eyes closed; and helsing, who had been watching closely, took
 arthur’s arm, and drew him away.
 
and then lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it
 ceased.
 
“it is all over,” said helsing. “she is dead!”
 
i took arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where he
 sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in way that
 nearly broke down to see.
 
i went back to the room, and found helsing looking at poor lucy, and
 his face was sterner than ever. some change had come over her body.
 death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had
 recovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their
 deadly pallor. it was as if the blood, longer needed for the working
 of the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as
 might be.
 
“we thought her dying whilst she slept,
 and sleeping when she died.”
 
i stood beside helsing, and said:--
 
“ah, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last. it is the end!”
 
turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--
 
“not so; alas! not so. it is only the beginning!”
 
when i asked him what meant, only shook his head and answered:--
 
“we can do nothing as yet. wait and see.”
 



chapter xiii
 
dr. seward’s diary--_continued_.
 

the funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that lucy and
 her mother might be buried together. i attended to all the ghastly
 formalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were
 afflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.
 even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to
 me, in confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out
 from the death-chamber:--
 
“she makes very beautiful corpse, sir. it’s quite privilege to
 attend on her. it’s not too much to say that she will do credit to our
 establishment!”
 
i noticed that helsing never kept far away. this was possible from
 the disordered state of things in the household. there were relatives
 at hand; and as arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his
 father’s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should have been
 bidden. under the circumstances, helsing and i took it upon
 ourselves to examine papers, etc. insisted upon looking over lucy’s
 papers himself. i asked him why, for i feared that he, being a
 foreigner, might not be quite aware of english legal requirements, and
 so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble. answered me:--
 
“i know; i know. you forget that i am lawyer as well as doctor. but
 this is not altogether for the law. you knew that, when you avoided the
 coroner. i have more than him to avoid. there may be papers more--such
 as this.”
 
as spoke took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been
 in lucy’s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.
 
“when you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late mrs.
 westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night. for me, i watch
 here in the room and in miss lucy’s old room all night, and i myself
 search for what may be. it is not well that her very thoughts go into
 the hands of strangers.”
 
i went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found
 the name and address of mrs. westenra’s solicitor and had written to
 him. all the poor lady’s papers were in order; explicit directions
 regarding the place of burial were given. i had hardly sealed the
 letter, when, to my surprise, helsing walked into the room,
 saying:--
 
“can i help you, friend john? i am free, and if i may, my service is to
 you.”
 
“have you got what you looked for?” i asked, to which replied:--
 
“i did not look for any specific thing. i only hoped to find, and find i
 have, all that there was--only some letters and few memoranda, and a
 diary new begun. but i have them here, and we shall for the present say
 nothing of them. i shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
 his sanction, i shall use some.”
 
when we had finished the work in hand, said to me:--
 
“and now, friend john, i think we may to bed. we want sleep, both you
 and i, and rest to recuperate. to-morrow we shall have much to do, but
 for the to-night there is need of us. alas!”
 
before turning in we went to look at poor lucy. the undertaker had
 certainly done his work well, for the room was turned into small
 _chapelle ardente_. there was wilderness of beautiful white flowers,
 and death was made as little repulsive as might be. the end of the
 winding-sheet was laid over the face; when the professor bent over and
 turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us, the tall
 wax candles showing sufficient light to note it well. all lucy’s
 loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed,
 instead of leaving traces of “decay’s effacing fingers,” had but
 restored the beauty of life, till positively i could not believe my eyes
 that i was looking at corpse.
 
the professor looked sternly grave. had not loved her as i had, and
 there was need for tears in his eyes. said to me: “remain till i
 return,” and left the room. came back with handful of wild garlic
 from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and
 placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. then he
 took from his neck, inside his collar, little gold crucifix, and
 placed it over the mouth. restored the sheet to its place, and we
 came away.
 
i was undressing in my own room, when, with premonitory tap at the
 door, entered, and at once began to speak:--
 
“to-morrow i want you to bring me, before night, set of post-mortem
 knives.”
 
“must we make an autopsy?” i asked.
 
“yes and no. i want to operate, but not as you think. let tell you
 now, but not word to another. i want to cut off her head and take out
 her heart. ah! you surgeon, and so shocked! you, whom i have seen with
 tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that make
 the rest shudder. oh, but i must not forget, my dear friend john, that
 you loved her; and i have not forgotten it, for it is i that shall
 operate, and you must only help. i would like to do it to-night, but for
 arthur i must not; will be free after his father’s funeral to-morrow,
 and will want to see her--to see _it_. then, when she is coffined
 ready for the next day, you and i shall come when all sleep. we shall
 unscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation: and then replace
 all, so that none know, save we alone.”
 
“but why do it at all? the girl is dead. why mutilate her poor body
 without need? and if there is necessity for post-mortem and nothing
 to gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human
 knowledge--why do it? without such it is monstrous.”
 
for answer put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite
 tenderness:--
 
“friend john, i pity your poor bleeding heart; and i love you the more
 because it does so bleed. if i could, i would take on myself the burden
 that you do bear. but there are things that you know not, but that you
 shall know, and bless for knowing, though they are not pleasant
 things. john, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet
 did you ever know to do any without good cause? i may err--i am but
 man; but i believe in all i do. was it not for these causes that you
 send for when the great trouble came? yes! were you not amazed, nay
 horrified, when i would not let arthur kiss his love--though she was
 dying--and snatched him away by all my strength? yes! and yet you saw
 how she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so
 weak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me? yes! and did you not
 hear swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful? yes!
 
“well, i have good reason now for all i want to do. you have for many
 years trust me; you have believe weeks past, when there be things so
 strange that you might have well doubt. believe yet little, friend
 john. if you trust not, then i must tell what i think; and that is
 not perhaps well. and if i work--as work i shall, matter trust or no
 trust--without my friend trust in me, i work with heavy heart and feel,
 oh! so lonely when i want all help and courage that may be!” paused a
 moment and went on solemnly: “friend john, there are strange and
 terrible days before us. let us not be two, but one, that so we work to
 good end. will you not have faith in me?”
 
i took his hand, and promised him. i held my door open as went away,
 and watched him go into his room and close the door. as i stood without
 moving, i saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had
 her back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where lucy
 lay. the sight touched me. devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful
 to those who show it unasked to those we love. here was poor girl
 putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch
 alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay
 might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....
 
* * * * *
 
i must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when van
 helsing waked by coming into my room. came over to my bedside and
 said:--
 
“you need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.”
 
“why not?” i asked. for his solemnity of the night before had greatly
 impressed me.
 
“because,” said sternly, “it is too late--or too early. see!” here he
 held up the little golden crucifix. “this was stolen in the night.”
 
“how, stolen,” i asked in wonder, “since you have it now?”
 
“because i get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the
 woman who robbed the dead and the living. her punishment will surely
 come, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did and thus
 unknowing, she only stole. now we must wait.”
 
went away on the word, leaving with new mystery to think of, a
 new puzzle to grapple with.
 
the forenoon was dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: mr.
 marquand, of wholeman, sons, marquand & lidderdale. was very genial
 and very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all
 cares as to details. during lunch told us that mrs. westenra had for
 some time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs
 in absolute order; informed us that, with the exception of certain
 entailed property of lucy’s father’s which now, in default of direct
 issue, went back to distant branch of the family, the whole estate,
 real and personal, was left absolutely to arthur holmwood. when had
 told us so much went on:--
 
“frankly we did our best to prevent such testamentary disposition, and
 pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either
 penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding matrimonial
 alliance. indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into
 collision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out
 her wishes. of course, we had then alternative but to accept. we were
 right in principle, and ninety-nine times out of hundred we should
 have proved, by the logic of events, the accuracy of our judgment.
 frankly, however, i must admit that in this case any other form of
 disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her
 wishes. for by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come
 into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived her
 mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no
 will--and will was practical impossibility in such case--have been
 treated at her decease as under intestacy. in which case lord godalming,
 though so dear friend, would have had claim in the world; and the
 inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon their just
 rights, for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger. i assure
 you, my dear sirs, i am rejoiced at the result, perfectly rejoiced.”
 
was good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which
 was officially interested--of so great tragedy, was an
 object-lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding.
 
did not remain long, but said would look in later in the day and
 see lord godalming. his coming, however, had been certain comfort to
 us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile
 criticism as to any of our acts. arthur was expected at five o’clock, so
 little before that time we visited the death-chamber. it was so in
 very truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it. the undertaker,
 true to his craft, had made the best display could of his goods, and
 there was mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at
 once. helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,
 explaining that, as lord godalming was coming very soon, it would be
 less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fiancée_
 quite alone. the undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and
 exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them
 the night before, so that when arthur came such shocks to his feelings
 as we could avoid were saved.
 
poor fellow! looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart
 manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his
 much-tried emotions. had, i knew, been very genuinely and devotedly
 attached to his father; and to lose him, and at such time, was a
 bitter blow to him. with was warm as ever, and to helsing he
 was sweetly courteous; but i could not help seeing that there was some
 constraint with him. the professor noticed it, too, and motioned to
 bring him upstairs. i did so, and left him at the door of the room, as i
 felt would like to be quite alone with her, but took my arm and
 led in, saying huskily:--
 
“you loved her too, old fellow; she told all about it, and there was
 friend had closer place in her heart than you. i don’t know how to
 thank you for all you have done for her. i can’t think yet....”
 
here suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and
 laid his head on my breast, crying:--
 
“oh, jack! jack! what shall i do! the whole of life seems gone from me
 all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for to live for.”
 
i comforted him as well as i could. in such cases men do not need much
 expression. grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the
 shoulder, sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to man’s
 heart. i stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then i said
 softly to him:--
 
“come and look at her.”
 
together we moved over to the bed, and i lifted the lawn from her face.
 god! how beautiful she was. every hour seemed to be enhancing her
 loveliness. it frightened and amazed somewhat; and as for arthur, he
 fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. at
 last, after long pause, said to in faint whisper:--
 
“jack, is she really dead?”
 
i assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for i felt
 that such horrible doubt should not have life for moment longer than
 i could help--that it often happened that after death faces became
 softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was
 especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged
 suffering. it seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after
 kneeling beside the couch for while and looking at her lovingly and
 long, turned aside. i told him that that must be good-bye, as the
 coffin had to be prepared; so went back and took her dead hand in his
 and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead. came away,
 fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as came.
 
i left him in the drawing-room, and told helsing that had said
 good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker’s men
 to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. when he
 came out of the room again i told him of arthur’s question, and he
 replied:--
 
“i am not surprised. just now i doubted for moment myself!”
 
we all dined together, and i could see that poor art was trying to make
 the best of things. helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but
 when we had lit our cigars said--
 
“lord----”; but arthur interrupted him:--
 
“no, no, not that, for god’s sake! not yet at any rate. forgive me, sir:
 i did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so
 recent.”
 
the professor answered very sweetly:--
 
“i only used that name because i was in doubt. i must not call you
 ‘mr.,’ and i have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as
 arthur.”
 
arthur held out his hand, and took the old man’s warmly.
 
“call what you will,” said. “i hope i may always have the title of
 friend. and let say that i am at loss for words to thank you for
 your goodness to my poor dear.” paused moment, and went on: “i know
 that she understood your goodness even better than i do; and if i was
 rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember”--the
 professor nodded--“you must forgive me.”
 
answered with grave kindness:--
 
“i know it was hard for you to quite trust then, for to trust such
 violence needs to understand; and i take it that you do not--that you
 cannot--trust now, for you do not yet understand. and there may be
 more times when i shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may
 not--and must not yet understand. but the time will come when your trust
 shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as
 though the sunlight himself shone through. then you shall bless from
 first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her
 dear sake to whom i swore to protect.”
 
“and, indeed, indeed, sir,” said arthur warmly, “i shall in all ways
 trust you. i know and believe you have very noble heart, and you are
 jack’s friend, and you were hers. you shall do what you like.”
 
the professor cleared his throat couple of times, as though about to
 speak, and finally said:--
 
“may i ask you something now?”
 
“certainly.”
 
“you know that mrs. westenra left you all her property?”
 
“no, poor dear; i never thought of it.”
 
“and as it is all yours, you have right to deal with it as you will. i
 want you to give permission to read all miss lucy’s papers and
 letters. believe me, it is idle curiosity. i have motive of which,
 be sure, she would have approved. i have them all here. i took them
 before we knew that all was yours, so that strange hand might touch
 them--no strange eye look through words into her soul. i shall keep
 them, if i may; even you may not see them yet, but i shall keep them
 safe. word shall be lost; and in the good time i shall give them back
 to you. it’s hard thing i ask, but you will do it, will you not, for
 lucy’s sake?”
 
arthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--
 
“dr. helsing, you may do what you will. i feel that in saying this i
 am doing what my dear one would have approved. i shall not trouble you
 with questions till the time comes.”
 
the old professor stood up as said solemnly:--
 
“and you are right. there will be pain for us all; but it will not be
 all pain, nor will this pain be the last. we and you too--you most of
 all, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we
 reach the sweet. but we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our
 duty, and all will be well!”
 
i slept on sofa in arthur’s room that night. helsing did not go to
 bed at all. went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was
 never out of sight of the room where lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with
 the wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,
 heavy, overpowering smell into the night.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_22 september._--in the train to exeter. jonathan sleeping.
 
it seems only yesterday that the last entry was made, and yet how much
 between then, in whitby and all the world before me, jonathan away and
 news of him; and now, married to jonathan, jonathan solicitor, a
 partner, rich, master of his business, mr. hawkins dead and buried, and
 jonathan with another attack that may harm him. some day may ask me
 about it. down it all goes. i am rusty in my shorthand--see what
 unexpected prosperity does for us--so it may be as well to freshen it up
 again with an exercise anyhow....
 
the service was very simple and very solemn. there were only ourselves
 and the servants there, one or two old friends of his from exeter, his
 london agent, and gentleman representing sir john paxton, the
 president of the incorporated law society. jonathan and i stood hand in
 hand, and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us....
 
we came back to town quietly, taking ’bus to hyde park corner.
 jonathan thought it would interest to go into the row for while, so
 we sat down; but there were very few people there, and it was
 sad-looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs. it made us think
 of the empty chair at home; so we got up and walked down piccadilly.
 jonathan was holding by the arm, the way used to in old days
 before i went to school. i felt it very improper, for you can’t go on
 for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the
 pedantry of it biting into yourself bit; but it was jonathan, and he
 was my husband, and we didn’t know anybody who saw us--and we didn’t
 care if they did--so on we walked. i was looking at very beautiful
 girl, in big cart-wheel hat, sitting in victoria outside guiliano’s,
 when i felt jonathan clutch my arm so tight that hurt me, and said
 under his breath: “my god!” i am always anxious about jonathan, for i
 fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so i turned to him
 quickly, and asked him what it was that disturbed him.
 
was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and
 half in amazement, gazed at tall, thin man, with beaky nose and
 black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty
 girl. was looking at her so hard that did not see either of us,
 and so i had good view of him. his face was not good face; it was
 hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all
 the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal’s.
 jonathan kept staring at him, till i was afraid would notice. i
 feared might take it ill, looked so fierce and nasty. i asked
 jonathan why was disturbed, and answered, evidently thinking that
 i knew as much about it as did: “do you see who it is?”
 
“no, dear,” i said; “i don’t know him; who is it?” his answer seemed to
 shock and thrill me, for it was said as if did not know that it was
 to me, mina, to whom was speaking:--
 
“it is the man himself!”
 
the poor dear was evidently terrified at something--very greatly
 terrified; i do believe that if had not had to lean on and to
 support him would have sunk down. kept staring; man came out of
 the shop with small parcel, and gave it to the lady, who then drove
 off. the dark man kept his eyes fixed on her, and when the carriage
 moved up piccadilly followed in the same direction, and hailed a
 hansom. jonathan kept looking after him, and said, as if to himself:--
 
“i believe it is the count, but has grown young. my god, if this be
 so! oh, my god! my god! if i only knew! if i only knew!” was
 distressing himself so much that i feared to keep his mind on the
 subject by asking him any questions, so i remained silent. i drew him
 away quietly, and he, holding my arm, came easily. we walked little
 further, and then went in and sat for while in the green park. it was
 hot day for autumn, and there was comfortable seat in shady place.
 after few minutes’ staring at nothing, jonathan’s eyes closed, and he
 went quietly into sleep, with his head on my shoulder. i thought it
 was the best thing for him, so did not disturb him. in about twenty
 minutes woke up, and said to quite cheerfully:--
 
“why, mina, have i been asleep! oh, do forgive for being so rude.
 come, and we’ll have cup of tea somewhere.” had evidently forgotten
 all about the dark stranger, as in his illness had forgotten all that
 this episode had reminded him of. i don’t like this lapsing into
 forgetfulness; it may make or continue some injury to the brain. i must
 not ask him, for fear i shall do more harm than good; but i must somehow
 learn the facts of his journey abroad. the time is come, i fear, when i
 must open that parcel, and know what is written. oh, jonathan, you will,
 i know, forgive if i do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--a sad home-coming in every way--the house empty of the dear
 soul who was so good to us; jonathan still pale and dizzy under slight
 relapse of his malady; and now telegram from helsing, whoever he
 may be:--
 
“you will be grieved to hear that mrs. westenra died five days ago, and
 that lucy died the day before yesterday. they were both buried to-day.”
 
oh, what wealth of sorrow in few words! poor mrs. westenra! poor
 lucy! gone, gone, never to return to us! and poor, poor arthur, to have
 lost such sweetness out of his life! god help us all to bear our
 troubles.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_22 september._--it is all over. arthur has gone back to ring, and has
 taken quincey morris with him. what fine fellow is quincey! i believe
 in my heart of hearts that suffered as much about lucy’s death as any
 of us; but bore himself through it like moral viking. if america
 can go on breeding men like that, she will be power in the world
 indeed. helsing is lying down, having rest preparatory to his
 journey. goes over to amsterdam to-night, but says returns
 to-morrow night; that only wants to make some arrangements which can
 only be made personally. is to stop with then, if can; says
 has work to do in london which may take him some time. poor old
 fellow! i fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his
 iron strength. all the time of the burial was, i could see, putting
 some terrible restraint on himself. when it was all over, we were
 standing beside arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in
 the operation where his blood had been transfused to his lucy’s veins; i
 could see helsing’s face grow white and purple by turns. arthur was
 saying that felt since then as if they two had been really married
 and that she was his wife in the sight of god. none of us said word of
 the other operations, and none of us ever shall. arthur and quincey went
 away together to the station, and helsing and i came on here. the
 moment we were alone in the carriage gave way to regular fit of
 hysterics. has denied to since that it was hysterics, and insisted
 that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very
 terrible conditions. laughed till cried, and i had to draw down
 the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then cried,
 till laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as woman
 does. i tried to be stern with him, as one is to woman under the
 circumstances; but it had effect. men and women are so different in
 manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! then when his face grew
 grave and stern again i asked him why his mirth, and why at such time.
 his reply was in way characteristic of him, for it was logical and
 forceful and mysterious. said:--
 
“ah, you don’t comprehend, friend john. do not think that i am not sad,
 though i laugh. see, i have cried even when the laugh did choke me. but
 more think that i am all sorry when i cry, for the laugh come
 just the same. keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your
 door and say, ‘may i come in?’ is not the true laughter. no! is a
 king, and come when and how like. ask person; choose no
 time of suitability. say, ‘i am here.’ behold, in example i grieve my
 heart out for that so sweet young girl; i give my blood for her, though
 i am old and worn; i give my time, my skill, my sleep; i let my other
 sufferers want that so she may have all. and yet i can laugh at her very
 grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her
 coffin and say ‘thud! thud!’ to my heart, till it send back the blood
 from my cheek. my heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of
 the age of mine own boy had i been so blessed that live, and with his
 hair and eyes the same. there, you know now why i love him so. and yet
 when say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my
 father-heart yearn to him as to other man--not even to you, friend
 john, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even
 at such moment king laugh come to and shout and bellow in my ear,
 ‘here i am! here i am!’ till the blood come dance back and bring some of
 the sunshine that carry with him to my cheek. oh, friend john, it is
 strange world, sad world, world full of miseries, and woes, and
 troubles; and yet when king laugh come make them all dance to the
 tune play. bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and
 tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he
 make with that smileless mouth of him. and believe me, friend john, that
 is good to come, and kind. ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn
 tight with strain that pull us different ways. then tears come; and,
 like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain
 become too great, and we break. but king laugh come like the
 sunshine, and ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with
 our labour, what it may be.”
 
i did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as i
 did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, i asked him. as he
 answered his face grew stern, and said in quite different
 tone:--
 
“oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with
 flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she
 were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely
 churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother
 who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going ‘toll!
 toll! toll!’ so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white
 garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time
 their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. and all
 for what? she is dead; so! is it not?”
 
“well, for the life of me, professor,” i said, “i can’t see anything to
 laugh at in all that. why, your explanation makes it harder puzzle
 than before. but even if the burial service was comic, what about poor
 art and his trouble? why, his heart was simply breaking.”
 
“just so. said not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had
 made her truly his bride?”
 
“yes, and it was sweet and comforting idea for him.”
 
“quite so. but there was difficulty, friend john. if so that, then
 what about the others? ho, ho! then this so sweet maid is polyandrist,
 and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by church’s law, though
 wits, all gone--even i, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,
 am bigamist.”
 
“i don’t see where the joke comes in there either!” i said; and i did
 not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. laid
 his hand on my arm, and said:--
 
“friend john, forgive if i pain. i showed not my feeling to others
 when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom i can trust.
 if you could have looked into my very heart then when i want to laugh;
 if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so
 now, when king laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for
 go far, far away from me, and for long, long time--maybe you would
 perhaps pity the most of all.”
 
i was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.
 
“because i know!”
 
and now we are all scattered; and for many long day loneliness will
 sit over our roofs with brooding wings. lucy lies in the tomb of her
 kin, lordly death-house in lonely churchyard, away from teeming
 london; where the air is fresh, and the sun rises over hampstead hill,
 and where wild flowers grow of their own accord.
 
so i can finish this diary; and god only knows if i shall ever begin
 another. if i do, or if i even open this again, it will be to deal with
 different people and different themes; for here at the end, where the
 romance of my life is told, ere i go back to take up the thread of my
 life-work, i say sadly and without hope,
 
“finis.”
 

_“the westminster gazette,” 25 september._
 
hampstead mystery.
 

the neighbourhood of hampstead is just at present exercised with a
 series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what
 was known to the writers of headlines as “the kensington horror,” or
 “the stabbing woman,” or “the woman in black.” during the past two or
 three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from
 home or neglecting to return from their playing on the heath. in all
 these cases the children were too young to give any properly
 intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses
 is that they had been with “bloofer lady.” it has always been late in
 the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the
 children have not been found until early in the following morning. it is
 generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed
 gave as his reason for being away that “bloofer lady” had asked him to
 come for walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as
 occasion served. this is the more natural as the favourite game of the
 little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. a
 correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to
 be the “bloofer lady” is supremely funny. some of our caricaturists
 might, says, take lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the
 reality and the picture. it is only in accordance with general
 principles of human nature that the “bloofer lady” should be the popular
 rôle at these _al fresco_ performances. our correspondent naïvely says
 that even ellen terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of
 these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine
 themselves--to be.
 
there is, however, possibly serious side to the question, for some of
 the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been
 slightly torn or wounded in the throat. the wounds seem such as might be
 made by rat or small dog, and although of not much importance
 individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has
 system or method of its own. the police of the division have been
 instructed to keep sharp look-out for straying children, especially
 when very young, in and around hampstead heath, and for any stray dog
 which may be about.

the hampstead horror.
 
another child injured.
 
_the “bloofer lady.”_
 
we have just received intelligence that another child, missed last
 night, was only discovered late in the morning under furze bush at the
 shooter’s hill side of hampstead heath, which is, perhaps, less
 frequented than the other parts. it has the same tiny wound in the
 throat as has been noticed in other cases. it was terribly weak, and
 looked quite emaciated. it too, when partially restored, had the common
 story to tell of being lured away by the “bloofer lady.”
 



chapter xiv
 
mina harker’s journal
 

_23 september_.--jonathan is better after bad night. i am so glad that
 has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible
 things; and oh, i am rejoiced that is not now weighed down with the
 responsibility of his new position. i knew would be true to himself,
 and now how proud i am to see my jonathan rising to the height of his
 advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon
 him. will be away all day till late, for said could not lunch
 at home. my household work is done, so i shall take his foreign journal,
 and lock myself up in my room and read it....
 

_24 september_.--i hadn’t the heart to write last night; that terrible
 record of jonathan’s upset so. poor dear! how must have suffered,
 whether it be true or only imagination. i wonder if there is any truth
 in it at all. did get his brain fever, and then write all those
 terrible things, or had some cause for it all? i suppose i shall
 never know, for i dare not open the subject to him.... and yet that man
 we saw yesterday! seemed quite certain of him.... poor fellow! i
 suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some
 train of thought.... believes it all himself. i remember how on our
 wedding-day said: “unless some solemn duty come upon to go back to
 the bitter hours, asleep or awake, mad or sane.” there seems to be
 through it all some thread of continuity.... that fearful count was
 coming to london.... if it should be, and came to london, with his
 teeming millions.... there may be solemn duty; and if it come we must
 not shrink from it.... i shall be prepared. i shall get my typewriter
 this very hour and begin transcribing. then we shall be ready for other
 eyes if required. and if it be wanted; then, perhaps, if i am ready,
 poor jonathan may not be upset, for i can speak for him and never let
 him be troubled or worried with it at all. if ever jonathan quite gets
 over the nervousness may want to tell of it all, and i can ask him
 questions and find out things, and see how i may comfort him.
 

_letter, helsing to mrs. harker._
 
“_24 september._
 
(_confidence_)
 
“dear madam,--
 
“i pray you to pardon my writing, in that i am so far friend as that i
 sent to you sad news of miss lucy westenra’s death. by the kindness of
 lord godalming, i am empowered to read her letters and papers, for i am
 deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important. in them i find
 some letters from you, which show how great friends you were and how you
 love her. oh, madam mina, by that love, i implore you, help me. it is
 for others’ good that i ask--to redress great wrong, and to lift much
 and terrible troubles--that may be more great than you can know. may it
 be that i see you? you can trust me. i am friend of dr. john seward and
 of lord godalming (that was arthur of miss lucy). i must keep it private
 for the present from all. i should come to exeter to see you at once if
 you tell i am privilege to come, and where and when. i implore your
 pardon, madam. i have read your letters to poor lucy, and know how good
 you are and how your husband suffer; so i pray you, if it may be,
 enlighten him not, lest it may harm. again your pardon, and forgive me.
 
“van helsing.”
 

_telegram, mrs. harker to helsing._
 
“_25 september._--come to-day by quarter-past ten train if you can catch
 it. can see you any time you call.
 
“wilhelmina harker.”
 
mina harker’s journal.
 
_25 september._--i cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time
 draws near for the visit of dr. helsing, for somehow i expect that
 it will throw some light upon jonathan’s sad experience; and as he
 attended poor dear lucy in her last illness, can tell all about
 her. that is the reason of his coming; it is concerning lucy and her
 sleep-walking, and not about jonathan. then i shall never know the real
 truth now! how silly i am. that awful journal gets hold of my
 imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. of
 course it is about lucy. that habit came back to the poor dear, and that
 awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. i had almost forgotten
 in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. she must have told him
 of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that i knew all about
 it; and now wants to tell him what she knows, so that may
 understand. i hope i did right in not saying anything of it to mrs.
 westenra; i should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even
 negative one, brought harm on poor dear lucy. i hope, too, dr. van
 helsing will not blame me; i have had so much trouble and anxiety of
 late that i feel i cannot bear more just at present.
 
i suppose cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain
 does. perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and
 then jonathan went away this morning to stay away from whole day
 and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. i do
 hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
 occur to upset him. it is two o’clock, and the doctor will be here soon
 now. i shall say nothing of jonathan’s journal unless asks me. i am
 so glad i have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case asks
 about lucy, i can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--he has come and gone. oh, what strange meeting, and how it
 all makes my head whirl round! i feel like one in dream. can it be all
 possible, or even part of it? if i had not read jonathan’s journal
 first, i should never have accepted even possibility. poor, poor, dear
 jonathan! how must have suffered. please the good god, all this may
 not upset him again. i shall try to save him from it; but it may be even
 consolation and help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its
 consequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did
 not deceive him, and that it is all true. it may be that it is the doubt
 which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, matter
 which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, will be more
 satisfied and better able to bear the shock. dr. helsing must be a
 good man as well as clever one if is arthur’s friend and dr.
 seward’s, and if they brought him all the way from holland to look after
 lucy. i feel from having seen him that _is_ good and kind and of a
 noble nature. when comes to-morrow i shall ask him about jonathan;
 and then, please god, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to good
 end. i used to think i would like to practise interviewing; jonathan’s
 friend on “the exeter news” told him that memory was everything in such
 work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word
 spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. here was rare
 interview; i shall try to record it _verbatim_.
 
it was half-past two o’clock when the knock came. i took my courage _à
 deux mains_ and waited. in few minutes mary opened the door, and
 announced “dr. helsing.”
 
i rose and bowed, and came towards me; man of medium weight,
 strongly built, with his shoulders set back over broad, deep chest and
 neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. the poise
 of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the
 head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. the face,
 clean-shaven, shows hard, square chin, large, resolute, mobile
 mouth, good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive
 nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the
 mouth tightens. the forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost
 straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;
 such forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,
 but falls naturally back and to the sides. big, dark blue eyes are set
 widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man’s moods. he
 said to me:--
 
“mrs. harker, is it not?” i bowed assent.
 
“that was miss mina murray?” again i assented.
 
“it is mina murray that i came to see that was friend of that poor dear
 child lucy westenra. madam mina, it is on account of the dead i come.”
 
“sir,” i said, “you could have better claim on than that you were
 friend and helper of lucy westenra.” and i held out my hand. took
 it and said tenderly:--
 
“oh, madam mina, i knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be
 good, but i had yet to learn----” finished his speech with courtly
 bow. i asked him what it was that wanted to see about, so at
 once began:--
 
“i have read your letters to miss lucy. forgive me, but i had to begin
 to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. i know that you were
 with her at whitby. she sometimes kept diary--you need not look
 surprised, madam mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in
 imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain
 things to sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. in
 great perplexity then i come to you, and ask you out of your so much
 kindness to tell all of it that you can remember.”
 
“i can tell you, i think, dr. helsing, all about it.”
 
“ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? it is not always
 so with young ladies.”
 
“no, doctor, but i wrote it all down at the time. i can show it to you
 if you like.”
 
“oh, madam mina, i will be grateful; you will do much favour.” i
 could not resist the temptation of mystifying him bit--i suppose it is
 some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our
 mouths--so i handed him the shorthand diary. took it with grateful
 bow, and said:--
 
“may i read it?”
 
“if you wish,” i answered as demurely as i could. opened it, and for
 an instant his face fell. then stood up and bowed.
 
“oh, you so clever woman!” said. “i knew long that mr. jonathan was a
 man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.
 and will you not so much honour and so help as to read it for me?
 alas! i know not the shorthand.” by this time my little joke was over,
 and i was almost ashamed; so i took the typewritten copy from my
 workbasket and handed it to him.
 
“forgive me,” i said: “i could not help it; but i had been thinking that
 it was of dear lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not
 have time to wait--not on my account, but because i know your time must
 be precious--i have written it out on the typewriter for you.”
 
took it and his eyes glistened. “you are so good,” said. “and may
 i read it now? i may want to ask you some things when i have read.”
 
“by all means,” i said, “read it over whilst i order lunch; and then you
 can ask questions whilst we eat.” bowed and settled himself in a
 chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,
 whilst i went to see after lunch chiefly in order that might not be
 disturbed. when i came back, i found him walking hurriedly up and down
 the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. rushed up to and
 took by both hands.
 
“oh, madam mina,” said, “how can i say what i owe to you? this paper
 is as sunshine. it opens the gate to me. i am daze, i am dazzle, with so
 much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. but that
 you do not, cannot, comprehend. oh, but i am grateful to you, you so
 clever woman. madam”--he said this very solemnly--“if ever abraham van
 helsing can do anything for you or yours, i trust you will let know.
 it will be pleasure and delight if i may serve you as friend; as a
 friend, but all i have ever learned, all i can ever do, shall be for you
 and those you love. there are darknesses in life, and there are lights;
 you are one of the lights. you will have happy life and good life, and
 your husband will be blessed in you.”
 
“but, doctor, you praise too much, and--and you do not know me.”
 
“not know you--i, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and
 women; i, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to
 him and all that follow from him! and i have read your diary that you
 have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every
 line. i, who have read your so sweet letter to poor lucy of your
 marriage and your trust, not know you! oh, madam mina, good women tell
 all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that
 angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of
 angels’ eyes. your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for
 you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. and your
 husband--tell of him. is quite well? is all that fever gone, and
 is strong and hearty?” i saw here an opening to ask him about
 jonathan, so i said:--
 
“he was almost recovered, but has been greatly upset by mr. hawkins’s
 death.” interrupted:--
 
“oh, yes, i know, i know. i have read your last two letters.” i went
 on:--
 
“i suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on thursday last he
 had sort of shock.”
 
“a shock, and after brain fever so soon! that was not good. what kind of
 shock was it?”
 
“he thought saw some one who recalled something terrible, something
 which led to his brain fever.” and here the whole thing seemed to
 overwhelm in rush. the pity for jonathan, the horror which he
 experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that
 has been brooding over ever since, all came in tumult. i suppose i
 was hysterical, for i threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to
 him, and implored him to make my husband well again. took my hands
 and raised up, and made sit on the sofa, and sat by me; held my
 hand in his, and said to with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--
 
“my life is barren and lonely one, and so full of work that i have not
 had much time for friendships; but since i have been summoned to here by
 my friend john seward i have known so many good people and seen such
 nobility that i feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing
 years--the loneliness of my life. believe, me, then, that i come here
 full of respect for you, and you have given hope--hope, not in what i
 am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life
 happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for
 the children that are to be. i am glad, glad, that i may here be of some
 use to you; for if your husband suffer, suffer within the range of my
 study and experience. i promise you that i will gladly do _all_ for him
 that i can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life happy
 one. now you must eat. you are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.
 husband jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what like not
 where love, is not to his good. therefore for his sake you must eat
 and smile. you have told all about lucy, and so now we shall not
 speak of it, lest it distress. i shall stay in exeter to-night, for i
 want to think much over what you have told me, and when i have thought i
 will ask you questions, if i may. and then, too, you will tell of
 husband jonathan’s trouble so far as you can, but not yet. you must eat
 now; afterwards you shall tell all.”
 
after lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, said to me:--
 
“and now tell all about him.” when it came to speaking to this great
 learned man, i began to fear that would think weak fool, and
 jonathan madman--that journal is all so strange--and i hesitated to go
 on. but was so sweet and kind, and had promised to help, and i
 trusted him, so i said:--
 
“dr. helsing, what i have to tell you is so queer that you must not
 laugh at or at my husband. i have been since yesterday in sort of
 fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think foolish that i
 have even half believed some very strange things.” reassured by
 his manner as well as his words when said:--
 
“oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which
 i am here, it is you who would laugh. i have learned not to think little
 of any one’s belief, matter how strange it be. i have tried to keep
 an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close
 it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that
 make one doubt if they be mad or sane.”
 
“thank you, thank you, thousand times! you have taken weight off my
 mind. if you will let me, i shall give you paper to read. it is long,
 but i have typewritten it out. it will tell you my trouble and
 jonathan’s. it is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that
 happened. i dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and
 judge. and then when i see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell
 what you think.”
 
“i promise,” said as i gave him the papers; “i shall in the morning,
 so soon as i can, come to see you and your husband, if i may.”
 
“jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch
 with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which
 will leave you at paddington before eight.” was surprised at my
 knowledge of the trains off-hand, but does not know that i have made
 up all the trains to and from exeter, so that i may help jonathan in
 case is in hurry.
 
so took the papers with him and went away, and i sit here
 thinking--thinking i don’t know what.

_letter (by hand), helsing to mrs. harker._
 
“_25 september, 6 o’clock._
 
“dear madam mina,--
 
“i have read your husband’s so wonderful diary. you may sleep without
 doubt. strange and terrible as it is, it is _true_! i will pledge my
 life on it. it may be worse for others; but for him and you there is no
 dread. is noble fellow; and let tell you from experience of men,
 that one who would do as did in going down that wall and to that
 room--ay, and going second time--is not one to be injured in
 permanence by shock. his brain and his heart are all right; this i
 swear, before i have even seen him; so be at rest. i shall have much to
 ask him of other things. i am blessed that to-day i come to see you, for
 i have learn all at once so much that again i am dazzle--dazzle more
 than ever, and i must think.
 
“yours the most faithful,
 
“abraham helsing.”
 

_letter, mrs. harker to helsing._
 
“_25 september, 6:30 p. m._
 
“my dear dr. helsing,--
 
“a thousand thanks for your kind letter, which has taken great weight
 off my mind. and yet, if it be true, what terrible things there are in
 the world, and what an awful thing if that man, that monster, be really
 in london! i fear to think. i have this moment, whilst writing, had a
 wire from jonathan, saying that leaves by the 6:25 to-night from
 launceston and will be here at 10:18, so that i shall have fear
 to-night. will you, therefore, instead of lunching with us, please come
 to breakfast at eight o’clock, if this be not too early for you? you can
 get away, if you are in hurry, by the 10:30 train, which will bring
 you to paddington by 2:35. do not answer this, as i shall take it that,
 if i do not hear, you will come to breakfast.
 
“believe me,
 
“your faithful and grateful friend,
 
“mina harker.”
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_26 september._--i thought never to write in this diary again, but the
 time has come. when i got home last night mina had supper ready, and
 when we had supped she told of helsing’s visit, and of her having
 given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been
 about me. she showed in the doctor’s letter that all i wrote down was
 true. it seems to have made new man of me. it was the doubt as to the
 reality of the whole thing that knocked over. i felt impotent, and in
 the dark, and distrustful. but, now that i _know_, i am not afraid, even
 of the count. has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting
 to london, and it was i saw. has got younger, and how? helsing
 is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if is anything like what
 mina says. we sat late, and talked it all over. mina is dressing, and i
 shall call at the hotel in few minutes and bring him over....
 
was, i think, surprised to see me. when i came into the room where he
 was, and introduced myself, took by the shoulder, and turned my
 face round to the light, and said, after sharp scrutiny:--
 
“but madam mina told you were ill, that you had had shock.” it was
 so funny to hear my wife called “madam mina” by this kindly,
 strong-faced old man. i smiled, and said:--
 
“i _was_ ill, i _have_ had shock; but you have cured already.”
 
“and how?”
 
“by your letter to mina last night. i was in doubt, and then everything
 took hue of unreality, and i did not know what to trust, even the
 evidence of my own senses. not knowing what to trust, i did not know
 what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been
 the groove of my life. the groove ceased to avail me, and i mistrusted
 myself. doctor, you don’t know what it is to doubt everything, even
 yourself. no, you don’t; you couldn’t with eyebrows like yours.” he
 seemed pleased, and laughed as said:--
 
“so! you are physiognomist. i learn more here with each hour. i am with
 so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will
 pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.” i
 would listen to him go on praising mina for day, so i simply nodded
 and stood silent.
 
“she is one of god’s women, fashioned by his own hand to show us men and
 other women that there is heaven where we can enter, and that its
 light can be here on earth. so true, so sweet, so noble, so little an
 egoist--and that, let tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and
 selfish. and you, sir--i have read all the letters to poor miss lucy,
 and some of them speak of you, so i know you since some days from the
 knowing of others; but i have seen your true self since last night. you
 will give your hand, will you not? and let us be friends for all our
 lives.”
 
we shook hands, and was so earnest and so kind that it made quite
 choky.
 
“and now,” said, “may i ask you for some more help? i have great
 task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. you can help here.
 can you tell what went before your going to transylvania? later on i
 may ask more help, and of different kind; but at first this will do.”
 
“look here, sir,” i said, “does what you have to do concern the count?”
 
“it does,” said solemnly.
 
“then i am with you heart and soul. as you go by the 10:30 train, you
 will not have time to read them; but i shall get the bundle of papers.
 you can take them with you and read them in the train.”
 
after breakfast i saw him to the station. when we were parting he
 said:--
 
“perhaps you will come to town if i send to you, and take madam mina
 too.”
 
“we shall both come when you will,” i said.
 
i had got him the morning papers and the london papers of the previous
 night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the
 train to start, was turning them over. his eyes suddenly seemed to
 catch something in one of them, “the westminster gazette”--i knew it by
 the colour--and grew quite white. read something intently,
 groaning to himself: “mein gott! mein gott! so soon! so soon!” i do not
 think remembered at the moment. just then the whistle blew, and
 the train moved off. this recalled him to himself, and leaned out of
 the window and waved his hand, calling out: “love to madam mina; i shall
 write so soon as ever i can.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_26 september._--truly there is such thing as finality. not week
 since i said “finis,” and yet here i am starting fresh again, or rather
 going on with the same record. until this afternoon i had cause to
 think of what is done. renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as
 ever was. was already well ahead with his fly business; and had
 just started in the spider line also; so had not been of any trouble
 to me. i had letter from arthur, written on sunday, and from it i
 gather that is bearing up wonderfully well. quincey morris is with
 him, and that is much of help, for himself is bubbling well of
 good spirits. quincey wrote line too, and from him i hear that
 arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to
 them all my mind is at rest. as for myself, i was settling down to my
 work with the enthusiasm which i used to have for it, so that i might
 fairly have said that the wound which poor lucy left on was becoming
 cicatrised. everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the
 end god only knows. i have an idea that helsing thinks knows,
 too, but will only let out enough at time to whet curiosity. he
 went to exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. to-day came
 back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o’clock,
 and thrust last night’s “westminster gazette” into my hand.
 
“what do you think of that?” asked as stood back and folded his
 arms.
 
i looked over the paper, for i really did not know what meant; but he
 took it from and pointed out paragraph about children being decoyed
 away at hampstead. it did not convey much to me, until i reached a
 passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. an
 idea struck me, and i looked up. “well?” said.
 
“it is like poor lucy’s.”
 
“and what do you make of it?”
 
“simply that there is some cause in common. whatever it was that injured
 her has injured them.” i did not quite understand his answer:--
 
“that is true indirectly, but not directly.”
 
“how do you mean, professor?” i asked. i was little inclined to take
 his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom
 from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one’s spirits--but
 when i saw his face, it sobered me. never, even in the midst of our
 despair about poor lucy, had looked more stern.
 
“tell me!” i said. “i can hazard opinion. i do not know what to
 think, and i have data on which to found conjecture.”
 
“do you mean to tell me, friend john, that you have suspicion as to
 what poor lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by
 events, but by me?”
 
“of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.”
 
“and how the blood lost or waste?” i shook my head. stepped over and
 sat down beside me, and went on:--
 
“you are clever man, friend john; you reason well, and your wit is bold;
 but you are too prejudiced. you do not let your eyes see nor your ears
 hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to
 you. do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,
 and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? but
 there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men’s
 eyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men
 have told them. ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to
 explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to
 explain. but yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,
 which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend
 to be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. i suppose now you do not
 believe in corporeal transference. no? nor in materialisation. no? nor
 in astral bodies. no? nor in the reading of thought. no? nor in
 hypnotism----”
 
“yes,” i said. “charcot has proved that pretty well.” smiled as he
 went on: “then you are satisfied as to it. yes? and of course then you
 understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great
 charcot--alas that is more!--into the very soul of the patient
 that influence. no? then, friend john, am i to take it that you
 simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion
 be blank? no? then tell me--for i am student of the brain--how you
 accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. let tell you, my
 friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which
 would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered
 electricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned
 as wizards. there are always mysteries in life. why was it that
 methuselah lived nine hundred years, and ‘old parr’ one hundred and
 sixty-nine, and yet that poor lucy, with four men’s blood in her poor
 veins, could not live even one day? for, had she live one more day, we
 could have save her. do you know all the mystery of life and death? do
 you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the
 qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? can you tell me
 why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived
 for centuries in the tower of the old spanish church and grew and grew,
 till, on descending, could drink the oil of all the church lamps? can
 you tell why in the pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that
 come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their
 veins; how in some islands of the western seas there are bats which hang
 on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant
 nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that
 it is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are
 found dead men, white as even miss lucy was?”
 
“good god, professor!” i said, starting up. “do you mean to tell that
 lucy was bitten by such bat; and that such thing is here in london
 in the nineteenth century?” waved his hand for silence, and went
 on:--
 
“can you tell why the tortoise lives more long than generations of
 men; why the elephant goes on and on till have seen dynasties; and
 why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?
 can you tell why men believe in all ages and places that there are
 some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and
 women who cannot die? we all know--because science has vouched for the
 fact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of
 years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of
 the world. can you tell how the indian fakir can make himself to die
 and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the
 corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men
 come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the indian
 fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?” here
 i interrupted him. i was getting bewildered; so crowded on my mind
 his list of nature’s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my
 imagination was getting fired. i had dim idea that was teaching me
 some lesson, as long ago used to do in his study at amsterdam; but
 used then to tell the thing, so that i could have the object of
 thought in mind all the time. but now i was without this help, yet i
 wanted to follow him, so i said:--
 
“professor, let be your pet student again. tell the thesis, so
 that i may apply your knowledge as you go on. at present i am going in
 my mind from point to point as mad man, and not sane one, follows an
 idea. i feel like novice lumbering through bog in mist, jumping
 from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without
 knowing where i am going.”
 
“that is good image,” said. “well, i shall tell you. my thesis is
 this: i want you to believe.”
 
“to believe what?”
 
“to believe in things that you cannot. let illustrate. i heard once
 of an american who so defined faith: ‘that faculty which enables us to
 believe things which we know to be untrue.’ for one, i follow that man.
 meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let little bit of
 truth check the rush of big truth, like small rock does railway
 truck. we get the small truth first. good! we keep him, and we value
 him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in
 the universe.”
 
“then you want not to let some previous conviction injure the
 receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. do i read
 your lesson aright?”
 
“ah, you are my favourite pupil still. it is worth to teach you. now
 that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to
 understand. you think then that those so small holes in the children’s
 throats were made by the same that made the hole in miss lucy?”
 
“i suppose so.” stood up and said solemnly:--
 
“then you are wrong. oh, would it were so! but alas! no. it is worse,
 far, far worse.”
 
“in god’s name, professor helsing, what do you mean?” i cried.
 
threw himself with despairing gesture into chair, and placed his
 elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as spoke:--
 
“they were made by miss lucy!”
 



chapter xv
 
dr. seward’s diary--_continued_.
 

for while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if had during her life
 struck lucy on the face. i smote the table hard and rose up as i said to
 him:--
 
“dr. helsing, are you mad?” raised his head and looked at me, and
 somehow the tenderness of his face calmed at once. “would i were!” he
 said. “madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. oh, my
 friend, why, think you, did i go so far round, why take so long to tell
 you so simple thing? was it because i hate you and have hated you all
 my life? was it because i wished to give you pain? was it that i wanted,
 now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a
 fearful death? ah no!”
 
“forgive me,” said i. went on:--
 
“my friend, it was because i wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,
 for i know you have loved that so sweet lady. but even yet i do not
 expect you to believe. it is so hard to accept at once any abstract
 truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
 believed the ‘no’ of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a
 concrete truth, and of such one as miss lucy. to-night i go to prove
 it. dare you come with me?”
 
this staggered me. man does not like to prove such truth; byron
 excepted from the category, jealousy.
 
“and prove the very truth most abhorred.”
 
saw my hesitation, and spoke:--
 
“the logic is simple, madman’s logic this time, jumping from tussock
 to tussock in misty bog. if it be not true, then proof will be relief;
 at worst it will not harm. if it be true! ah, there is the dread; yet
 very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. come,
 i tell you what i propose: first, that we go off now and see that child
 in the hospital. dr. vincent, of the north hospital, where the papers
 say the child is, is friend of mine, and i think of yours since you were
 in class at amsterdam. will let two scientists see his case, if he
 will not let two friends. we shall tell him nothing, but only that we
 wish to learn. and then----”
 
“and then?” took key from his pocket and held it up. “and then we
 spend the night, you and i, in the churchyard where lucy lies. this is
 the key that lock the tomb. i had it from the coffin-man to give to
 arthur.” my heart sank within me, for i felt that there was some fearful
 ordeal before us. i could do nothing, however, so i plucked up what
 heart i could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was
 passing....
 
we found the child awake. it had had sleep and taken some food, and
 altogether was going on well. dr. vincent took the bandage from its
 throat, and showed us the punctures. there was mistaking the
 similarity to those which had been on lucy’s throat. they were smaller,
 and the edges looked fresher; that was all. we asked vincent to what he
 attributed them, and replied that it must have been bite of some
 animal, perhaps rat; but, for his own part, was inclined to think
 that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern
 heights of london. “out of so many harmless ones,” said, “there may
 be some wild specimen from the south of more malignant species. some
 sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from
 the zoölogical gardens young one may have got loose, or one be bred
 there from vampire. these things do occur, you know. only ten days ago
 wolf got out, and was, i believe, traced up in this direction. for a
 week after, the children were playing nothing but red riding hood on the
 heath and in every alley in the place until this ‘bloofer lady’ scare
 came along, since when it has been quite gala-time with them. even
 this poor little mite, when woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he
 might go away. when she asked him why wanted to go, said wanted
 to play with the ‘bloofer lady.’”
 
“i hope,” said helsing, “that when you are sending the child home
 you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. these fancies
 to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another
 night, it would probably be fatal. but in any case i suppose you will
 not let it away for some days?”
 
“certainly not, not for week at least; longer if the wound is not
 healed.”
 
our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and
 the sun had dipped before we came out. when helsing saw how dark it
 was, said:--
 
“there is hurry. it is more late than i thought. come, let us seek
 somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.”
 
we dined at “jack straw’s castle” along with little crowd of
 bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. about ten o’clock we
 started from the inn. it was then very dark, and the scattered lamps
 made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual
 radius. the professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he
 went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, i was in quite mixup as to
 locality. as we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at
 last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse
 police going their usual suburban round. at last we reached the wall of
 the churchyard, which we climbed over. with some little difficulty--for
 it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found
 the westenra tomb. the professor took the key, opened the creaky door,
 and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned to
 precede him. there was delicious irony in the offer, in the
 courtliness of giving preference on such ghastly occasion. my
 companion followed quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after
 carefully ascertaining that the lock was falling, and not spring,
 one. in the latter case we should have been in bad plight. then he
 fumbled in his bag, and taking out matchbox and piece of candle,
 proceeded to make light. the tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed
 with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some
 days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites
 turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the
 beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured
 stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished
 brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a
 candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been
 imagined. it conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was
 not the only thing which could pass away.
 
helsing went about his work systematically. holding his candle so
 that could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm
 dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he
 made assurance of lucy’s coffin. another search in his bag, and took
 out turnscrew.
 
“what are you going to do?” i asked.
 
“to open the coffin. you shall yet be convinced.” straightway began
 taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the
 casing of lead beneath. the sight was almost too much for me. it seemed
 to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have
 stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; i actually took
 hold of his hand to stop him. only said: “you shall see,” and again
 fumbling in his bag, took out tiny fret-saw. striking the turnscrew
 through the lead with swift downward stab, which made wince, he
 made small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of
 the saw. i had expected rush of gas from the week-old corpse. we
 doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to
 such things, and i drew back towards the door. but the professor never
 stopped for moment; sawed down couple of feet along one side of
 the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. taking the
 edge of the loose flange, bent it back towards the foot of the
 coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to to
 look.
 
i drew near and looked. the coffin was empty.
 
it was certainly surprise to me, and gave considerable shock, but
 helsing was unmoved. was now more sure than ever of his ground,
 and so emboldened to proceed in his task. “are you satisfied now, friend
 john?” asked.
 
i felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within as
 i answered him:--
 
“i am satisfied that lucy’s body is not in that coffin; but that only
 proves one thing.”
 
“and what is that, friend john?”
 
“that it is not there.”
 
“that is good logic,” said, “so far as it goes. but how do you--how
 can you--account for it not being there?”
 
“perhaps body-snatcher,” i suggested. “some of the undertaker’s people
 may have stolen it.” i felt that i was speaking folly, and yet it was
 the only real cause which i could suggest. the professor sighed. “ah
 well!” said, “we must have more proof. come with me.”
 
put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed
 them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the
 bag. we opened the door, and went out. behind us closed the door and
 locked it. handed the key, saying: “will you keep it? you had
 better be assured.” i laughed--it was not very cheerful laugh, i am
 bound to say--as i motioned him to keep it. “a key is nothing,” i said;
 “there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick lock
 of that kind.” said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. then he
 told to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst would watch at
 the other. i took up my place behind yew-tree, and i saw his dark
 figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my
 sight.
 
it was lonely vigil. just after i had taken my place i heard distant
 clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. i was chilled and
 unnerved, and angry with the professor for taking on such an errand
 and with myself for coming. i was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly
 observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether i had
 dreary, miserable time.
 
suddenly, as i turned round, i thought i saw something like white
 streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard
 farthest from the tomb; at the same time dark mass moved from the
 professor’s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. then i
 too moved; but i had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and i
 stumbled over graves. the sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an
 early cock crew. little way off, beyond line of scattered
 juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, white, dim
 figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. the tomb itself was hidden
 by trees, and i could not see where the figure disappeared. i heard the
 rustle of actual movement where i had first seen the white figure, and
 coming over, found the professor holding in his arms tiny child. when
 saw held it out to me, and said:--
 
“are you satisfied now?”
 
“no,” i said, in way that i felt was aggressive.
 
“do you not see the child?”
 
“yes, it is child, but who brought it here? and is it wounded?” i
 asked.
 
“we shall see,” said the professor, and with one impulse we took our way
 out of the churchyard, carrying the sleeping child.
 
when we had got some little distance away, we went into clump of
 trees, and struck match, and looked at the child’s throat. it was
 without scratch or scar of any kind.
 
“was i right?” i asked triumphantly.
 
“we were just in time,” said the professor thankfully.
 
we had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted
 about it. if we were to take it to police-station we should have to
 give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should
 have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.
 so finally we decided that we would take it to the heath, and when we
 heard policeman coming, would leave it where could not fail to find
 it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. all fell out
 well. at the edge of hampstead heath we heard policeman’s heavy
 tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until
 saw it as flashed his lantern to and fro. we heard his exclamation
 of astonishment, and then we went away silently. by good chance we got a
 cab near the “spaniards,” and drove to town.
 
i cannot sleep, so i make this entry. but i must try to get few hours’
 sleep, as helsing is to call for at noon. insists that i shall
 go with him on another expedition.
 
* * * * *
 
_27 september._--it was two o’clock before we found suitable
 opportunity for our attempt. the funeral held at noon was all completed,
 and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily
 away, when, looking carefully from behind clump of alder-trees, we saw
 the sexton lock the gate after him. we knew then that we were safe till
 morning did we desire it; but the professor told that we should not
 want more than an hour at most. again i felt that horrid sense of the
 reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of
 place; and i realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were
 incurring in our unhallowed work. besides, i felt it was all so useless.
 outrageous as it was to open leaden coffin, to see if woman dead
 nearly week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to
 open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own
 eyesight, that the coffin was empty. i shrugged my shoulders, however,
 and rested silent, for helsing had way of going on his own road,
 matter who remonstrated. took the key, opened the vault, and again
 courteously motioned to precede. the place was not so gruesome as
 last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine
 streamed in. helsing walked over to lucy’s coffin, and i followed.
 bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then shock
 of surprise and dismay shot through me.
 
there lay lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her
 funeral. she was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and i
 could not believe that she was dead. the lips were red, nay redder than
 before; and on the cheeks was delicate bloom.
 
“is this juggle?” i said to him.
 
“are you convinced now?” said the professor in response, and as spoke
 put over his hand, and in way that made shudder, pulled back the
 dead lips and showed the white teeth.
 
“see,” went on, “see, they are even sharper than before. with this
 and this”--and touched one of the canine teeth and that below
 it--“the little children can be bitten. are you of belief now, friend
 john?” once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. i _could_ not
 accept such an overwhelming idea as suggested; so, with an attempt to
 argue of which i was even at the moment ashamed, i said:--
 
“she may have been placed here since last night.”
 
“indeed? that is so, and by whom?”
 
“i do not know. some one has done it.”
 
“and yet she has been dead one week. most peoples in that time would not
 look so.” i had answer for this, so was silent. helsing did not
 seem to notice my silence; at any rate, showed neither chagrin nor
 triumph. was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising
 the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and
 examining the teeth. then turned to and said:--
 
“here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is
 some dual life that is not as the common. she was bitten by the vampire
 when she was in trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know
 that, friend john, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could
 best come to take more blood. in trance she died, and in trance she
 is un-dead, too. so it is that she differ from all other. usually when
 the un-dead sleep at home”--as spoke made comprehensive sweep of
 his arm to designate what to vampire was “home”--“their face show what
 they are, but this so sweet that was when she not un-dead she go back to
 the nothings of the common dead. there is malign there, see, and so
 it make hard that i must kill her in her sleep.” this turned my blood
 cold, and it began to dawn upon that i was accepting helsing’s
 theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the
 idea of killing her? looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in
 my face, for said almost joyously:--
 
“ah, you believe now?”
 
i answered: “do not press too hard all at once. i am willing to
 accept. how will you do this bloody work?”
 
“i shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and i shall
 drive stake through her body.” it made shudder to think of so
 mutilating the body of the woman whom i had loved. and yet the feeling
 was not so strong as i had expected. i was, in fact, beginning to
 shudder at the presence of this being, this un-dead, as helsing
 called it, and to loathe it. is it possible that love is all subjective,
 or all objective?
 
i waited considerable time for helsing to begin, but stood as
 if wrapped in thought. presently closed the catch of his bag with a
 snap, and said:--
 
“i have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. if i
 did simply follow my inclining i would do now, at this moment, what is
 to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are
 thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. this is
 simple. she have yet life taken, though that is of time; and to act
 now would be to take danger from her for ever. but then we may have to
 want arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? if you, who saw the
 wounds on lucy’s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child’s at
 the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full
 to-day with woman who have not change only to be more rose and more
 beautiful in whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know
 of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,
 and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can i expect
 arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? doubted when i
 took him from her kiss when she was dying. i know has forgiven me
 because in some mistaken idea i have done things that prevent him say
 good-bye as ought; and may think that in some more mistaken idea
 this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have
 killed her. will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that
 have killed her by our ideas; and so will be much unhappy always. yet
 never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. and will
 sometimes think that she loved was buried alive, and that will paint
 his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he
 will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,
 an un-dead. no! i told him once, and since then i learn much. now, since
 i know it is all true, hundred thousand times more do i know that he
 must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. he, poor fellow,
 must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to
 him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. my mind is
 made up. let us go. you return home for to-night to your asylum, and see
 that all be well. as for me, i shall spend the night here in this
 churchyard in my own way. to-morrow night you will come to to the
 berkeley hotel at ten of the clock. i shall send for arthur to come too,
 and also that so fine young man of america that gave his blood. later we
 shall all have work to do. i come with you so far as piccadilly and
 there dine, for i must be back here before the sun set.”
 
so we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the
 churchyard, which was not much of task, and drove back to piccadilly.

“_27 september._
 
“friend john,--
 
“i write this in case anything should happen. i go alone to watch in
 that churchyard. it pleases that the un-dead, miss lucy, shall not
 leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.
 therefore i shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a
 crucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. she is young as un-dead,
 and will heed. moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they
 may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the un-dead is
 desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may
 be. i shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,
 and if there be aught that may be learned i shall learn it. for miss
 lucy or from her, i have fear; but that other to whom is there that
 she is un-dead, have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.
 is cunning, as i know from mr. jonathan and from the way that all
 along have fooled us when played with us for miss lucy’s life, and
 we lost; and in many ways the un-dead are strong. have always the
 strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength
 to miss lucy it also is all to him. besides, can summon his wolf and
 i know not what. so if it be that come thither on this night shall
 find me; but none other shall--until it be too late. but it may be that
 will not attempt the place. there is reason why should; his
 hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the
 un-dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.
 
“therefore i write this in case.... take the papers that are with this,
 the diaries of harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this
 great un-dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive stake
 through it, so that the world may rest from him.
 
“if it be so, farewell.
 
“van helsing.”
 


_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_28 september._--it is wonderful what good night’s sleep will do for
 one. yesterday i was almost willing to accept helsing’s monstrous
 ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before as outrages on
 common sense. i have doubt that believes it all. i wonder if his
 mind can have become in any way unhinged. surely there must be _some_
 rational explanation of all these mysterious things. is it possible that
 the professor can have done it himself? is so abnormally clever that
 if went off his head would carry out his intent with regard to
 some fixed idea in wonderful way. i am loath to think it, and indeed
 it would be almost as great marvel as the other to find that van
 helsing was mad; but anyhow i shall watch him carefully. i may get some
 light on the mystery.
 
* * * * *
 
_29 september, morning._.... last night, at little before ten o’clock,
 arthur and quincey came into helsing’s room; told us all that he
 wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to arthur, as if all
 our wills were centred in his. began by saying that hoped we would
 all come with him too, “for,” said, “there is grave duty to be done
 there. you were doubtless surprised at my letter?” this query was
 directly addressed to lord godalming.
 
“i was. it rather upset for bit. there has been so much trouble
 around my house of late that i could do without any more. i have been
 curious, too, as to what you mean. quincey and i talked it over; but the
 more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now i can say for myself
 that i’m about up tree as to any meaning about anything.”
 
“me too,” said quincey morris laconically.
 
“oh,” said the professor, “then you are nearer the beginning, both of
 you, than friend john here, who has to go long way back before can
 even get so far as to begin.”
 
it was evident that recognised my return to my old doubting frame of
 mind without my saying word. then, turning to the other two, said
 with intense gravity:--
 
“i want your permission to do what i think good this night. it is, i
 know, much to ask; and when you know what it is i propose to do you will
 know, and only then, how much. therefore may i ask that you promise me
 in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with for a
 time--i must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may
 be--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.”
 
“that’s frank anyhow,” broke in quincey. “i’ll answer for the professor.
 i don’t quite see his drift, but i swear he’s honest; and that’s good
 enough for me.”
 
“i thank you, sir,” said helsing proudly. “i have done myself the
 honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear
 to me.” held out hand, which quincey took.
 
then arthur spoke out:--
 
“dr. helsing, i don’t quite like to ‘buy pig in poke,’ as they
 say in scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as gentleman
 or my faith as christian is concerned, i cannot make such promise.
 if you can assure that what you intend does not violate either of
 these two, then i give my consent at once; though for the life of me, i
 cannot understand what you are driving at.”
 
“i accept your limitation,” said helsing, “and all i ask of you is
 that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first
 consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your
 reservations.”
 
“agreed!” said arthur; “that is only fair. and now that the
 _pourparlers_ are over, may i ask what it is we are to do?”
 
“i want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at
 kingstead.”
 
arthur’s face fell as said in an amazed sort of way:--
 
“where poor lucy is buried?” the professor bowed. arthur went on: “and
 when there?”
 
“to enter the tomb!” arthur stood up.
 
“professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? pardon me,
 i see that you are in earnest.” sat down again, but i could see that
 sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. there was
 silence until asked again:--
 
“and when in the tomb?”
 
“to open the coffin.”
 
“this is too much!” said, angrily rising again. “i am willing to be
 patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration
 of the grave--of one who----” fairly choked with indignation. the
 professor looked pityingly at him.
 
“if i could spare you one pang, my poor friend,” said, “god knows i
 would. but this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and
 for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!”
 
arthur looked up with set white face and said:--
 
“take care, sir, take care!”
 
“would it not be well to hear what i have to say?” said helsing.
 “and then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. shall i go
 on?”
 
“that’s fair enough,” broke in morris.
 
after pause helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--
 
“miss lucy is dead; is it not so? yes! then there can be wrong to
 her. but if she be not dead----”
 
arthur jumped to his feet.
 
“good god!” cried. “what do you mean? has there been any mistake; has
 she been buried alive?” groaned in anguish that not even hope could
 soften.
 
“i did not say she was alive, my child; i did not think it. i go no
 further than to say that she might be un-dead.”
 
“un-dead! not alive! what do you mean? is this all nightmare, or what
 is it?”
 
“there are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they
 may solve only in part. believe me, we are now on the verge of one. but
 i have not done. may i cut off the head of dead miss lucy?”
 
“heavens and earth, no!” cried arthur in storm of passion. “not for
 the wide world will i consent to any mutilation of her dead body. dr.
 helsing, you try too far. what have i done to you that you should
 torture so? what did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to
 cast such dishonour on her grave? are you mad to speak such things, or
 am i mad to listen to them? don’t dare to think more of such a
 desecration; i shall not give my consent to anything you do. i have a
 duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by god, i shall do
 it!”
 
helsing rose up from where had all the time been seated, and
 said, gravely and sternly:--
 
“my lord godalming, i, too, have duty to do, duty to others, duty
 to you, duty to the dead; and, by god, i shall do it! all i ask you
 now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when
 later i make the same request you do not be more eager for its
 fulfilment even than i am, then--then i shall do my duty, whatever it
 may seem to me. and then, to follow of your lordship’s wishes i shall
 hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where
 you will.” his voice broke little, and went on with voice full of
 pity:--
 
“but, i beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. in long life of
 acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring
 my heart, i have never had so heavy task as now. believe that if
 the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from
 you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for i would do what man can
 to save you from sorrow. just think. for why should i give myself so
 much of labour and so much of sorrow? i have come here from my own land
 to do what i can of good; at the first to please my friend john, and
 then to help sweet young lady, whom, too, i came to love. for her--i
 am ashamed to say so much, but i say it in kindness--i gave what you
 gave; the blood of my veins; i gave it, i, who was not, like you, her
 lover, but only her physician and her friend. i gave to her my nights
 and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good
 even now, when she is the dead un-dead, she shall have it freely.” he
 said this with very grave, sweet pride, and arthur was much affected
 by it. took the old man’s hand and said in broken voice:--
 
“oh, it is hard to think of it, and i cannot understand; but at least i
 shall go with you and wait.”
 



chapter xvi
 
dr. seward’s diary--_continued_
 

it was just quarter before twelve o’clock when we got into the
 churchyard over the low wall. the night was dark with occasional gleams
 of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across
 the sky. we all kept somehow close together, with helsing slightly
 in front as led the way. when we had come close to the tomb i looked
 well at arthur, for i feared that the proximity to place laden with so
 sorrowful memory would upset him; but bore himself well. i took it
 that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way counteractant
 to his grief. the professor unlocked the door, and seeing natural
 hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by
 entering first himself. the rest of us followed, and closed the door.
 then lit dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. arthur stepped
 forward hesitatingly; helsing said to me:--
 
“you were with here yesterday. was the body of miss lucy in that
 coffin?”
 
“it was.” the professor turned to the rest saying:--
 
“you hear; and yet there is one who does not believe with me.” he
 took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. arthur
 looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed stepped
 forward. evidently did not know that there was leaden coffin, or,
 at any rate, had not thought of it. when saw the rent in the lead,
 the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away
 again, so that remained of ghastly whiteness; was still silent.
 helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and
 recoiled.
 
the coffin was empty!
 
for several minutes one spoke word. the silence was broken by
 quincey morris:--
 
“professor, i answered for you. your word is all i want. i wouldn’t ask
 such thing ordinarily--i wouldn’t so dishonour you as to imply a
 doubt; but this is mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.
 is this your doing?”
 
“i swear to you by all that i hold sacred that i have not removed nor
 touched her. what happened was this: two nights ago my friend seward and
 i came here--with good purpose, believe me. i opened that coffin, which
 was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. we then waited, and
 saw something white come through the trees. the next day we came here in
 day-time, and she lay there. did she not, friend john?”
 
“yes.”
 
“that night we were just in time. one more so small child was missing,
 and we find it, thank god, unharmed amongst the graves. yesterday i came
 here before sundown, for at sundown the un-dead can move. i waited here
 all the night till the sun rose, but i saw nothing. it was most probable
 that it was because i had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,
 which the un-dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. last
 night there was exodus, so to-night before the sundown i took away my
 garlic and other things. and so it is we find this coffin empty. but
 bear with me. so far there is much that is strange. wait you with me
 outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.
 so”--here shut the dark slide of his lantern--“now to the outside.”
 opened the door, and we filed out, coming last and locking the
 door behind him.
 
oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of
 that vault. how sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing
 gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and
 passing--like the gladness and sorrow of man’s life; how sweet it was
 to breathe the fresh air, that had taint of death and decay; how
 humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to
 hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of great city. each
 in his own way was solemn and overcome. arthur was silent, and was, i
 could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the
 mystery. i was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to
 throw aside doubt and to accept helsing’s conclusions. quincey
 morris was phlegmatic in the way of man who accepts all things, and
 accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all has to
 stake. not being able to smoke, cut himself good-sized plug of
 tobacco and began to chew. as to helsing, was employed in a
 definite way. first took from his bag mass of what looked like
 thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in white
 napkin; next took out double-handful of some whitish stuff, like
 dough or putty. crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the
 mass between his hands. this then took, and rolling it into thin
 strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its
 setting in the tomb. i was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,
 asked him what it was that was doing. arthur and quincey drew near
 also, as they too were curious. answered:--
 
“i am closing the tomb, so that the un-dead may not enter.”
 
“and is that stuff you have put there going to do it?” asked quincey.
 “great scott! is this game?”
 
“it is.”
 
“what is that which you are using?” this time the question was by
 arthur. helsing reverently lifted his hat as answered:--
 
“the host. i brought it from amsterdam. i have an indulgence.” it was an
 answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually
 that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the professor’s, a
 purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was
 impossible to distrust. in respectful silence we took the places
 assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any
 one approaching. i pitied the others, especially arthur. i had myself
 been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet i,
 who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink
 within me. never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or
 yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree
 or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so
 mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a
 woeful presage through the night.
 
there was long spell of silence, big, aching void, and then from the
 professor keen “s-s-s-s!” pointed; and far down the avenue of yews
 we saw white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something
 dark at its breast. the figure stopped, and at the moment ray of
 moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling
 prominence dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.
 we could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a
 fair-haired child. there was pause and sharp little cry, such as a
 child gives in sleep, or dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. we
 were starting forward, but the professor’s warning hand, seen by us as
 stood behind yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the
 white figure moved forwards again. it was now near enough for us to see
 clearly, and the moonlight still held. my own heart grew cold as ice,
 and i could hear the gasp of arthur, as we recognised the features of
 lucy westenra. lucy westenra, but yet how changed. the sweetness was
 turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous
 wantonness. helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we
 all advanced too; the four of us ranged in line before the door of the
 tomb. helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the
 concentrated light that fell on lucy’s face we could see that the lips
 were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her
 chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.
 
we shuddered with horror. i could see by the tremulous light that even
 helsing’s iron nerve had failed. arthur was next to me, and if i had
 not seized his arm and held him up, would have fallen.
 
when lucy--i call the thing that was before us lucy because it bore her
 shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as cat gives
 when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. lucy’s eyes in form
 and colour; but lucy’s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of
 the pure, gentle orbs we knew. at that moment the remnant of my love
 passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, i could have
 done it with savage delight. as she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy
 light, and the face became wreathed with voluptuous smile. oh, god,
 how it made shudder to see it! with careless motion, she flung to
 the ground, callous as devil, the child that up to now she had
 clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as dog growls
 over bone. the child gave sharp cry, and lay there moaning. there
 was cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung groan from arthur; when
 she advanced to him with outstretched arms and wanton smile fell
 back and hid his face in his hands.
 
she still advanced, however, and with languorous, voluptuous grace,
 said:--
 
“come to me, arthur. leave these others and come to me. my arms are
 hungry for you. come, and we can rest together. come, my husband, come!”
 
there was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the
 tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us
 who heard the words addressed to another. as for arthur, seemed under
 spell; moving his hands from his face, opened wide his arms. she
 was leaping for them, when helsing sprang forward and held between
 them his little golden crucifix. she recoiled from it, and, with a
 suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter
 the tomb.
 
when within foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if
 arrested by some irresistible force. then she turned, and her face was
 shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no
 quiver from helsing’s iron nerves. never did i see such baffled
 malice on face; and never, i trust, shall such ever be seen again by
 mortal eyes. the beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw
 out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of
 the flesh were the coils of medusa’s snakes, and the lovely,
 blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of
 the greeks and japanese. if ever face meant death--if looks could
 kill--we saw it at that moment.
 
and so for full half minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained
 between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of
 entry. helsing broke the silence by asking arthur:--
 
“answer me, oh my friend! am i to proceed in my work?”
 
arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he
 answered:--
 
“do as you will, friend; do as you will. there can be horror like
 this ever any more;” and groaned in spirit. quincey and i
 simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. we could hear the
 click of the closing lantern as helsing held it down; coming close
 to the tomb, began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred
 emblem which had placed there. we all looked on in horrified
 amazement as we saw, when stood back, the woman, with corporeal
 body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice
 where scarce knife-blade could have gone. we all felt glad sense of
 relief when we saw the professor calmly restoring the strings of putty
 to the edges of the door.
 
when this was done, lifted the child and said:
 
“come now, my friends; we can do more till to-morrow. there is a
 funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. the
 friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock
 the gate we shall remain. then there is more to do; but not like this of
 to-night. as for this little one, is not much harm, and by to-morrow
 night shall be well. we shall leave him where the police will find
 him, as on the other night; and then to home.” coming close to arthur,
 said:--
 
“my friend arthur, you have had sore trial; but after, when you look
 back, you will see how it was necessary. you are now in the bitter
 waters, my child. by this time to-morrow you will, please god, have
 passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn
 overmuch. till then i shall not ask you to forgive me.”
 
arthur and quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other
 on the way. we had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all
 slept with more or less reality of sleep.
 
* * * * *
 
_29 september, night._--a little before twelve o’clock we three--arthur,
 quincey morris, and myself--called for the professor. it was odd to
 notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. of
 course, arthur wore black, for was in deep mourning, but the rest of
 us wore it by instinct. we got to the churchyard by half-past one, and
 strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the
 gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief
 that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to
 ourselves. helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a
 long leather one, something like cricketing bag; it was manifestly of
 fair weight.
 
when we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up
 the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the
 professor to the tomb. unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it
 behind us. then took from his bag the lantern, which lit, and also
 two wax candles, which, when lighted, stuck, by melting their own
 ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work
 by. when again lifted the lid off lucy’s coffin we all looked--arthur
 trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its
 death-beauty. but there was love in my own heart, nothing but
 loathing for the foul thing which had taken lucy’s shape without her
 soul. i could see even arthur’s face grow hard as looked. presently
 said to helsing:--
 
“is this really lucy’s body, or only demon in her shape?”
 
“it is her body, and yet not it. but wait while, and you all see her
 as she was, and is.”
 
she seemed like nightmare of lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,
 the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to
 see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
 devilish mockery of lucy’s sweet purity. helsing, with his usual
 methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and
 placing them ready for use. first took out soldering iron and some
 plumbing solder, and then small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in
 corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with blue
 flame; then his operating knives, which placed to hand; and last a
 round wooden stake, some two and half or three inches thick and about
 three feet long. one end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and
 was sharpened to fine point. with this stake came heavy hammer, such
 as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. to
 me, doctor’s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and
 bracing, but the effect of these things on both arthur and quincey was
 to cause them sort of consternation. they both, however, kept their
 courage, and remained silent and quiet.
 
when all was ready, helsing said:--
 
“before we do anything, let tell you this; it is out of the lore and
 experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers
 of the un-dead. when they become such, there comes with the change the
 curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age
 adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that
 die from the preying of the un-dead becomes themselves un-dead, and prey
 on their kind. and so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the
 ripples from stone thrown in the water. friend arthur, if you had met
 that kiss which you know of before poor lucy die; or again, last night
 when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,
 have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in eastern europe, and would
 all time make more of those un-deads that so have fill us with horror.
 the career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. those
 children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if
 she live on, un-dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her
 power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that
 so wicked mouth. but if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny
 wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays
 unknowing ever of what has been. but of the most blessed of all, when
 this now un-dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor
 lady whom we love shall again be free. instead of working wickedness by
 night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she
 shall take her place with the other angels. so that, my friend, it will
 be blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.
 to this i am willing; but is there none amongst us who has better
 right? will it be joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the
 night when sleep is not: ‘it was my hand that sent her to the stars; it
 was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would
 herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?’ tell if there be
 such one amongst us?”
 
we all looked at arthur. saw, too, what we all did, the infinite
 kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore
 lucy to us as holy, and not an unholy, memory; stepped forward and
 said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as
 snow:--
 
“my true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart i thank you. tell me
 what i am to do, and i shall not falter!” helsing laid hand on his
 shoulder, and said:--
 
“brave lad! moment’s courage, and it is done. this stake must be
 driven through her. it will be fearful ordeal--be not deceived in
 that--but it will be only short time, and you will then rejoice more
 than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though
 you tread on air. but you must not falter when once you have begun. only
 think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for
 you all the time.”
 
“go on,” said arthur hoarsely. “tell what i am to do.”
 
“take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the
 heart, and the hammer in your right. then when we begin our prayer for
 the dead--i shall read him, i have here the book, and the others shall
 follow--strike in god’s name, that so all may be well with the dead that
 we love and that the un-dead pass away.”
 
arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on
 action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. helsing opened
 his missal and began to read, and quincey and i followed as well as we
 could. arthur placed the point over the heart, and as i looked i could
 see its dint in the white flesh. then struck with all his might.
 
the thing in the coffin writhed; and hideous, blood-curdling screech
 came from the opened red lips. the body shook and quivered and twisted
 in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the
 lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with crimson foam. but arthur
 never faltered. looked like figure of thor as his untrembling arm
 rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst
 the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. his
 face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it
 gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little
 vault.
 
and then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the
 teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. finally it lay still. the
 terrible task was over.
 
the hammer fell from arthur’s hand. reeled and would have fallen had
 we not caught him. the great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,
 and his breath came in broken gasps. it had indeed been an awful strain
 on him; and had not been forced to his task by more than human
 considerations could never have gone through with it. for few
 minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the
 coffin. when we did, however, murmur of startled surprise ran from one
 to the other of us. we gazed so eagerly that arthur rose, for had
 been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then glad,
 strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of
 horror that lay upon it.
 
there, in the coffin lay longer the foul thing that we had so dreaded
 and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a
 privilege to the one best entitled to it, but lucy as we had seen her in
 her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. true that
 there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and
 pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth
 to what we knew. one and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like
 sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and
 symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.
 
helsing came and laid his hand on arthur’s shoulder, and said to
 him:--
 
“and now, arthur my friend, dear lad, am i not forgiven?”
 
the reaction of the terrible strain came as took the old man’s hand
 in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--
 
“forgiven! god bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,
 and peace.” put his hands on the professor’s shoulder, and laying
 his head on his breast, cried for while silently, whilst we stood
 unmoving. when raised his head helsing said to him:--
 
“and now, my child, you may kiss her. kiss her dead lips if you will, as
 she would have you to, if for her to choose. for she is not grinning
 devil now--not any more foul thing for all eternity. longer she is
 the devil’s un-dead. she is god’s true dead, whose soul is with him!”
 
arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and quincey out of the
 tomb; the professor and i sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point
 of it in the body. then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with
 garlic. we soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,
 and gathering up our belongings, came away. when the professor locked
 the door gave the key to arthur.
 
outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it
 seemed as if all nature were tuned to different pitch. there was
 gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves
 on one account, and we were glad, though it was with tempered joy.
 
before we moved away helsing said:--
 
“now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing
 to ourselves. but there remains greater task: to find out the author
 of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. i have clues which we can
 follow; but it is long task, and difficult, and there is danger in
 it, and pain. shall you not all help me? we have learned to believe, all
 of us--is it not so? and since so, do we not see our duty? yes! and do
 we not promise to go on to the bitter end?”
 
each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. then said the
 professor as we moved off:--
 
“two nights hence you shall meet with and dine together at seven of
 the clock with friend john. i shall entreat two others, two that you
 know not as yet; and i shall be ready to all our work show and our plans
 unfold. friend john, you come with home, for i have much to consult
 about, and you can help me. to-night i leave for amsterdam, but shall
 return to-morrow night. and then begins our great quest. but first i
 shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.
 then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a
 terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we
 must not draw back.”
 



chapter xvii
 
dr. seward’s diary--_continued_
 

when we arrived at the berkeley hotel, helsing found telegram
 waiting for him:--
 
“am coming up by train. jonathan at whitby. important news.--mina
 harker.”
 
the professor was delighted. “ah, that wonderful madam mina,” said,
 “pearl among women! she arrive, but i cannot stay. she must go to your
 house, friend john. you must meet her at the station. telegraph her _en
 route_, so that she may be prepared.”
 
when the wire was despatched had cup of tea; over it told of
 diary kept by jonathan harker when abroad, and gave typewritten
 copy of it, as also of mrs. harker’s diary at whitby. “take these,” he
 said, “and study them well. when i have returned you will be master of
 all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. keep
 them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. you will need all your
 faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. what
 is here told,” laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of
 papers as spoke, “may be the beginning of the end to you and and
 many another; or it may sound the knell of the un-dead who walk the
 earth. read all, i pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in
 any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. you have
 kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? yes! then we
 shall go through all these together when we meet.” then made ready
 for his departure, and shortly after drove off to liverpool street. i
 took my way to paddington, where i arrived about fifteen minutes before
 the train came in.
 
the crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival
 platforms; and i was beginning to feel uneasy, lest i might miss my
 guest, when sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,
 after quick glance, said: “dr. seward, is it not?”
 
“and you are mrs. harker!” i answered at once; whereupon she held out
 her hand.
 
“i knew you from the description of poor dear lucy; but----” she stopped
 suddenly, and quick blush overspread her face.
 
the blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it
 was tacit answer to her own. i got her luggage, which included a
 typewriter, and we took the underground to fenchurch street, after i had
 sent wire to my housekeeper to have sitting-room and bedroom
 prepared at once for mrs. harker.
 
in due time we arrived. she knew, of course, that the place was a
 lunatic asylum, but i could see that she was unable to repress shudder
 when we entered.
 
she told that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as
 she had much to say. so here i am finishing my entry in my phonograph
 diary whilst i await her. as yet i have not had the chance of looking at
 the papers which helsing left with me, though they lie open before
 me. i must get her interested in something, so that i may have an
 opportunity of reading them. she does not know how precious time is, or
 what task we have in hand. i must be careful not to frighten her. here
 she is!
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_29 september._--after i had tidied myself, i went down to dr. seward’s
 study. at the door i paused moment, for i thought i heard him talking
 with some one. as, however, had pressed to be quick, i knocked at
 the door, and on his calling out, “come in,” i entered.
 
to my intense surprise, there was one with him. was quite alone,
 and on the table opposite him was what i knew at once from the
 description to be phonograph. i had never seen one, and was much
 interested.
 
“i hope i did not keep you waiting,” i said; “but i stayed at the door
 as i heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.”
 
“oh,” replied with smile, “i was only entering my diary.”
 
“your diary?” i asked him in surprise.
 
“yes,” answered. “i keep it in this.” as spoke laid his hand on
 the phonograph. i felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--
 
“why, this beats even shorthand! may i hear it say something?”
 
“certainly,” replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train
 for speaking. then paused, and troubled look overspread his face.
 
“the fact is,” began awkwardly, “i only keep my diary in it; and as
 it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that
 is, i mean----” stopped, and i tried to help him out of his
 embarrassment:--
 
“you helped to attend dear lucy at the end. let hear how she died;
 for all that i know of her, i shall be very grateful. she was very, very
 dear to me.”
 
to my surprise, answered, with horrorstruck look in his face:--
 
“tell you of her death? not for the wide world!”
 
“why not?” i asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.
 again paused, and i could see that was trying to invent an excuse.
 at length stammered out:--
 
“you see, i do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
 diary.” even while was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and said
 with unconscious simplicity, in different voice, and with the naïveté
 of child: “that’s quite true, upon my honour. honest indian!” i could
 not but smile, at which grimaced. “i gave myself away that time!” he
 said. “but do you know that, although i have kept the diary for months
 past, it never once struck how i was going to find any particular
 part of it in case i wanted to look it up?” by this time my mind was
 made up that the diary of doctor who attended lucy might have
 something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible being, and
 i said boldly:--
 
“then, dr. seward, you had better let copy it out for you on my
 typewriter.” grew to positively deathly pallor as said:--
 
“no! no! no! for all the world, i wouldn’t let you know that terrible
 story!”
 
then it was terrible; my intuition was right! for moment i thought,
 and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or
 some opportunity to aid me, they lit on great batch of typewriting on
 the table. his eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,
 followed their direction. as they saw the parcel realised my meaning.
 
“you do not know me,” i said. “when you have read those papers--my own
 diary and my husband’s also, which i have typed--you will know me
 better. i have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in
 this cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and i must not
 expect you to trust so far.”
 
is certainly man of noble nature; poor dear lucy was right about
 him. stood up and opened large drawer, in which were arranged in
 order number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and
 said:--
 
“you are quite right. i did not trust you because i did not know you.
 but i know you now; and let say that i should have known you long
 ago. i know that lucy told you of me; she told of you too. may i make
 the only atonement in my power? take the cylinders and hear them--the
 first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify
 you; then you will know better. dinner will by then be ready. in the
 meantime i shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better
 able to understand certain things.” carried the phonograph himself up
 to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. now i shall learn something
 pleasant, i am sure; for it will tell the other side of true love
 episode of which i know one side already....
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_29 september._--i was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of jonathan
 harker and that other of his wife that i let the time run on without
 thinking. mrs. harker was not down when the maid came to announce
 dinner, so i said: “she is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour,” and
 i went on with my work. i had just finished mrs. harker’s diary, when
 she came in. she looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were
 flushed with crying. this somehow moved much. of late i have had
 cause for tears, god knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and
 now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went
 straight to my heart. so i said as gently as i could:--
 
“i greatly fear i have distressed you.”
 
“oh, no, not distressed me,” she replied, “but i have been more touched
 than i can say by your grief. that is wonderful machine, but it is
 cruelly true. it told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.
 it was like soul crying out to almighty god. one must hear them
 spoken ever again! see, i have tried to be useful. i have copied out the
 words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as
 i did.”
 
“no one need ever know, shall ever know,” i said in low voice. she
 laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--
 
“ah, but they must!”
 
“must! but why?” i asked.
 
“because it is part of the terrible story, part of poor dear lucy’s
 death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have
 before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all
 the knowledge and all the help which we can get. i think that the
 cylinders which you gave contained more than you intended to know;
 but i can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark
 mystery. you will let help, will you not? i know all up to certain
 point; and i see already, though your diary only took to 7 september,
 how poor lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought
 out. jonathan and i have been working day and night since professor van
 helsing saw us. is gone to whitby to get more information, and he
 will be here to-morrow to help us. we need have secrets amongst us;
 working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than
 if some of us were in the dark.” she looked at so appealingly, and at
 the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,
 that i gave in at once to her wishes. “you shall,” i said, “do as you
 like in the matter. god forgive if i do wrong! there are terrible
 things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to
 poor lucy’s death, you will not be content, i know, to remain in the
 dark. nay, the end--the very end--may give you gleam of peace. come,
 there is dinner. we must keep one another strong for what is before us;
 we have cruel and dreadful task. when you have eaten you shall learn
 the rest, and i shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything
 which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were
 present.”
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_29 september._--after dinner i came with dr. seward to his study. he
 brought back the phonograph from my room, and i took my typewriter. he
 placed in comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that i
 could touch it without getting up, and showed how to stop it in case
 i should want to pause. then very thoughtfully took chair, with his
 back to me, so that i might be as free as possible, and began to read. i
 put the forked metal to my ears and listened.
 
when the terrible story of lucy’s death, and--and all that followed, was
 done, i lay back in my chair powerless. fortunately i am not of a
 fainting disposition. when dr. seward saw jumped up with a
 horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking case-bottle from a
 cupboard, gave some brandy, which in few minutes somewhat restored
 me. my brain was all in whirl, and only that there came through all
 the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear lucy
 was at last at peace, i do not think i could have borne it without
 making scene. it is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if i
 had not known jonathan’s experience in transylvania i could not have
 believed. as it was, i didn’t know what to believe, and so got out of my
 difficulty by attending to something else. i took the cover off my
 typewriter, and said to dr. seward:--
 
“let write this all out now. we must be ready for dr. helsing
 when comes. i have sent telegram to jonathan to come on here when
 arrives in london from whitby. in this matter dates are everything,
 and i think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item
 put in chronological order, we shall have done much. you tell that
 lord godalming and mr. morris are coming too. let us be able to tell him
 when they come.” accordingly set the phonograph at slow pace, and i
 began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. i used
 manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as i had done with
 all the rest. it was late when i got through, but dr. seward went about
 his work of going his round of the patients; when had finished he
 came back and sat near me, reading, so that i did not feel too lonely
 whilst i worked. how good and thoughtful is; the world seems full of
 good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. before i left him i
 remembered what jonathan put in his diary of the professor’s
 perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at
 exeter; so, seeing that dr. seward keeps his newspapers, i borrowed the
 files of “the westminster gazette” and “the pall mall gazette,” and took
 them to my room. i remember how much “the dailygraph” and “the whitby
 gazette,” of which i had made cuttings, helped us to understand the
 terrible events at whitby when count dracula landed, so i shall look
 through the evening papers since then, and perhaps i shall get some new
 light. i am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep quiet.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_30 september._--mr. harker arrived at nine o’clock. had got his
 wife’s wire just before starting. is uncommonly clever, if one can
 judge from his face, and full of energy. if this journal be true--and
 judging by one’s own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also man
 of great nerve. that going down to the vault second time was a
 remarkable piece of daring. after reading his account of it i was
 prepared to meet good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,
 business-like gentleman who came here to-day.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--after lunch harker and his wife went back to their own room,
 and as i passed while ago i heard the click of the typewriter. they
 are hard at it. mrs. harker says that they are knitting together in
 chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. harker has got
 the letters between the consignee of the boxes at whitby and the
 carriers in london who took charge of them. is now reading his wife’s
 typescript of my diary. i wonder what they make out of it. here it
 is....
 
strange that it never struck that the very next house might be
 the count’s hiding-place! goodness knows that we had enough clues
 from the conduct of the patient renfield! the bundle of letters
 relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. oh,
 if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor lucy!
 stop; that way madness lies! harker has gone back, and is again
 collating his material. says that by dinner-time they will be
 able to show whole connected narrative. thinks that in the
 meantime i should see renfield, as hitherto has been sort of
 index to the coming and going of the count. i hardly see this yet,
 but when i get at the dates i suppose i shall. what good thing
 that mrs. harker put my cylinders into type! we never could have
 found the dates otherwise....
 
i found renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands
 folded, smiling benignly. at the moment seemed as sane as any
 one i ever saw. i sat down and talked with him on lot of
 subjects, all of which treated naturally. then, of his own
 accord, spoke of going home, subject has never mentioned to my
 knowledge during his sojourn here. in fact, spoke quite
 confidently of getting his discharge at once. i believe that, had i
 not had the chat with harker and read the letters and the dates of
 his outbursts, i should have been prepared to sign for him after a
 brief time of observation. as it is, i am darkly suspicious. all
 those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the
 count. what then does this absolute content mean? can it be that
 his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire’s ultimate triumph?
 stay; is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the
 chapel door of the deserted house always spoke of “master.” this
 all seems confirmation of our idea. however, after while i came
 away; my friend is just little too sane at present to make it
 safe to probe him too deep with questions. might begin to think,
 and then--! so i came away. i mistrust these quiet moods of his; so
 i have given the attendant hint to look closely after him, and to
 have strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_29 september, in train to london._--when i received mr. billington’s
 courteous message that would give any information in his power i
 thought it best to go down to whitby and make, on the spot, such
 inquiries as i wanted. it was now my object to trace that horrid cargo
 of the count’s to its place in london. later, we may be able to deal
 with it. billington junior, nice lad, met at the station, and
 brought to his father’s house, where they had decided that i must
 stay the night. they are hospitable, with true yorkshire hospitality:
 give guest everything, and leave him free to do as likes. they all
 knew that i was busy, and that my stay was short, and mr. billington had
 ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.
 it gave almost turn to see again one of the letters which i had
 seen on the count’s table before i knew of his diabolical plans.
 everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and
 with precision. seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which
 might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried
 out. to use an americanism, had “taken chances,” and the absolute
 accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the
 logical result of his care. i saw the invoice, and took note of it:
 “fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes.”
 also the copy of letter to carter paterson, and their reply; of both of
 these i got copies. this was all the information mr. billington could
 give me, so i went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the customs
 officers and the harbour-master. they had all something to say of the
 strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local
 tradition; but one could add to the simple description “fifty cases
 of common earth.” i then saw the station-master, who kindly put in
 communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. their
 tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that
 the boxes were “main and mortal heavy,” and that shifting them was dry
 work. one of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn’t any
 gentleman “such-like as yourself, squire,” to show some sort of
 appreciation of their efforts in liquid form; another put in rider
 that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had
 elapsed had not completely allayed it. needless to add, i took care
 before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of
 reproach.
 
* * * * *
 
_30 september._--the station-master was good enough to give line to
 his old companion the station-master at king’s cross, so that when i
 arrived there in the morning i was able to ask him about the arrival of
 the boxes. he, too, put at once in communication with the proper
 officials, and i saw that their tally was correct with the original
 invoice. the opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here
 limited; noble use of them had, however, been made, and again i was
 compelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.
 
from thence i went on to carter paterson’s central office, where i met
 with the utmost courtesy. they looked up the transaction in their
 day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their king’s cross
 office for more details. by good fortune, the men who did the teaming
 were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending
 also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the
 delivery of the boxes at carfax. here again i found the tally agreeing
 exactly; the carriers’ men were able to supplement the paucity of the
 written words with few details. these were, i shortly found, connected
 almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent
 thirst engendered in the operators. on my affording an opportunity,
 through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a
 later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--
 
“that ’ere ’ouse, guv’nor, is the rummiest i ever was in. blyme! but it
 ain’t been touched sence hundred years. there was dust that thick in
 the place that you might have slep’ on it without ’urtin’ of yer bones;
 an’ the place was that neglected that yer might ’ave smelled ole
 jerusalem in it. but the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! me
 and my mate, we thort we wouldn’t never git out quick enough. lor’, i
 wouldn’t take less nor quid moment to stay there arter dark.”
 
having been in the house, i could well believe him; but if knew what
 i know, would, i think, have raised his terms.
 
of one thing i am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at
 whitby from varna in the _demeter_ were safely deposited in the old
 chapel at carfax. there should be fifty of them there, unless any have
 since been removed--as from dr. seward’s diary i fear.
 
i shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from carfax when
 renfield attacked them. by following up this clue we may learn good
 deal.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--mina and i have worked all day, and we have put all the papers
 into order.
 

_mina harker’s journal_
 
_30 september._--i am so glad that i hardly know how to contain myself.
 it is, i suppose, the reaction from the haunting fear which i have had:
 that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act
 detrimentally on jonathan. i saw him leave for whitby with as brave a
 face as i could, but i was sick with apprehension. the effort has,
 however, done him good. was never so resolute, never so strong, never
 so full of volcanic energy, as at present. it is just as that dear, good
 professor helsing said: is true grit, and improves under
 strain that would kill weaker nature. came back full of life and
 hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. i
 feel myself quite wild with excitement. i suppose one ought to pity any
 thing so hunted as is the count. that is just it: this thing is not
 human--not even beast. to read dr. seward’s account of poor lucy’s
 death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in
 one’s heart.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--lord godalming and mr. morris arrived earlier than we
 expected. dr. seward was out on business, and had taken jonathan with
 him, so i had to see them. it was to painful meeting, for it
 brought back all poor dear lucy’s hopes of only few months ago. of
 course they had heard lucy speak of me, and it seemed that dr. van
 helsing, too, has been quite “blowing my trumpet,” as mr. morris
 expressed it. poor fellows, neither of them is aware that i know all
 about the proposals they made to lucy. they did not quite know what to
 say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they
 had to keep on neutral subjects. however, i thought the matter over, and
 came to the conclusion that the best thing i could do would be to post
 them in affairs right up to date. i knew from dr. seward’s diary that
 they had been at lucy’s death--her real death--and that i need not fear
 to betray any secret before the time. so i told them, as well as i
 could, that i had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband
 and i, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.
 i gave them each copy to read in the library. when lord godalming got
 his and turned it over--it does make pretty good pile--he said:--
 
“did you write all this, mrs. harker?”
 
i nodded, and went on:--
 
“i don’t quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and
 kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all
 i can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. i have
 had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make man humble
 to the last hour of his life. besides, i know you loved my poor lucy--”
 here turned away and covered his face with his hands. i could hear
 the tears in his voice. mr. morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid
 hand for moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the
 room. i suppose there is something in woman’s nature that makes man
 free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or
 emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when
 lord godalming found himself alone with sat down on the sofa and
 gave way utterly and openly. i sat down beside him and took his hand. i
 hope didn’t think it forward of me, and that if ever thinks of it
 afterwards never will have such thought. there i wrong him; i
 _know_ never will--he is too true gentleman. i said to him, for i
 could see that his heart was breaking:--
 
“i loved dear lucy, and i know what she was to you, and what you were to
 her. she and i were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let
 be like sister to you in your trouble? i know what sorrows you have
 had, though i cannot measure the depth of them. if sympathy and pity can
 help in your affliction, won’t you let be of some little service--for
 lucy’s sake?”
 
in an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. it seemed
 to that all that had of late been suffering in silence found a
 vent at once. grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat
 his palms together in perfect agony of grief. stood up and then sat
 down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. i felt an infinite
 pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. with sob laid his
 head on my shoulder and cried like wearied child, whilst shook with
 emotion.
 
we women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above
 smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; i felt this big
 sorrowing man’s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby
 that some day may lie on my bosom, and i stroked his hair as though he
 were my own child. i never thought at the time how strange it all was.
 
after little bit his sobs ceased, and raised himself with an
 apology, though made disguise of his emotion. told that for
 days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been
 unable to speak with any one, as man must speak in his time of
 sorrow. there was woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with
 whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was
 surrounded, could speak freely. “i know now how i suffered,” said,
 as dried his eyes, “but i do not know even yet--and none other can
 ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to to-day. i shall
 know better in time; and believe that, though i am not ungrateful
 now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. you will let be
 like brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear lucy’s sake?”
 
“for dear lucy’s sake,” i said as we clasped hands. “ay, and for your
 own sake,” added, “for if man’s esteem and gratitude are ever worth
 the winning, you have won mine to-day. if ever the future should bring
 to you time when you need man’s help, believe me, you will not call
 in vain. god grant that such time may ever come to you to break the
 sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise that you
 will let know.” was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that
 i felt it would comfort him, so i said:--
 
“i promise.”
 
as i came along the corridor i saw mr. morris looking out of window.
 turned as heard my footsteps. “how is art?” said. then noticing
 my red eyes, went on: “ah, i see you have been comforting him. poor
 old fellow! needs it. one but woman can help man when is in
 trouble of the heart; and had one to comfort him.”
 
bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. i saw the
 manuscript in his hand, and i knew that when read it would realise
 how much i knew; so i said to him:--
 
“i wish i could comfort all who suffer from the heart. will you let me
 be your friend, and will you come to for comfort if you need it? you
 will know, later on, why i speak.” saw that i was in earnest, and
 stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. it seemed
 but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish soul, and impulsively i
 bent over and kissed him. the tears rose in his eyes, and there was a
 momentary choking in his throat; said quite calmly:--
 
“little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long
 as ever you live!” then went into the study to his friend.
 
“little girl!”--the very words had used to lucy, and oh, but he
 proved himself friend!
 



chapter xviii
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_30 september._--i got home at five o’clock, and found that godalming
 and morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript
 of the various diaries and letters which harker and his wonderful wife
 had made and arranged. harker had not yet returned from his visit to the
 carriers’ men, of whom dr. hennessey had written to me. mrs. harker gave
 us cup of tea, and i can honestly say that, for the first time since i
 have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. when we had
 finished, mrs. harker said:--
 
“dr. seward, may i ask favour? i want to see your patient, mr.
 renfield. do let see him. what you have said of him in your diary
 interests so much!” she looked so appealing and so pretty that i
 could not refuse her, and there was possible reason why i should; so
 i took her with me. when i went into the room, i told the man that a
 lady would like to see him; to which simply answered: “why?”
 
“she is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,” i
 answered. “oh, very well,” said; “let her come in, by all means; but
 just wait minute till i tidy up the place.” his method of tidying was
 peculiar: simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes
 before i could stop him. it was quite evident that feared, or was
 jealous of, some interference. when had got through his disgusting
 task, said cheerfully: “let the lady come in,” and sat down on the
 edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that
 could see her as she entered. for moment i thought that might
 have some homicidal intent; i remembered how quiet had been just
 before attacked in my own study, and i took care to stand where i
 could seize him at once if attempted to make spring at her. she
 came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command
 the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad
 people most respect. she walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and
 held out her hand.
 
“good-evening, mr. renfield,” said she. “you see, i know you, for dr.
 seward has told of you.” made immediate reply, but eyed her all
 over intently with set frown on his face. this look gave way to one
 of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he
 said:--
 
“you’re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? you can’t be,
 you know, for she’s dead.” mrs. harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--
 
“oh no! i have husband of my own, to whom i was married before i ever
 saw dr. seward, or me. i am mrs. harker.”
 
“then what are you doing here?”
 
“my husband and i are staying on visit with dr. seward.”
 
“then don’t stay.”
 
“but why not?” i thought that this style of conversation might not be
 pleasant to mrs. harker, any more than it was to me, so i joined in:--
 
“how did you know i wanted to marry any one?” his reply was simply
 contemptuous, given in pause in which turned his eyes from mrs.
 harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--
 
“what an asinine question!”
 
“i don’t see that at all, mr. renfield,” said mrs. harker, at once
 championing me. replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as
 had shown contempt to me:--
 
“you will, of course, understand, mrs. harker, that when man is so
 loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of
 interest in our little community. dr. seward is loved not only by his
 household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of
 them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and
 effects. since i myself have been an inmate of lunatic asylum, i
 cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates
 lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.” i
 positively opened my eyes at this new development. here was my own pet
 lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that i had ever met
 with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of polished
 gentleman. i wonder if it was mrs. harker’s presence which had touched
 some chord in his memory. if this new phase was spontaneous, or in any
 way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or
 power.
 
we continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that was seemingly
 quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at questioningly as she
 began, to lead him to his favourite topic. i was again astonished, for
 addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the
 completest sanity; even took himself as an example when mentioned
 certain things.
 
“why, i myself am an instance of man who had strange belief. indeed,
 it was wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being
 put under control. i used to fancy that life was positive and
 perpetual entity, and that by consuming multitude of live things, no
 matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong
 life. at times i held the belief so strongly that i actually tried to
 take human life. the doctor here will bear out that on one occasion i
 tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by
 the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his
 blood--relying, of course, upon the scriptural phrase, ‘for the blood is
 the life.’ though, indeed, the vendor of certain nostrum has
 vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. isn’t that true,
 doctor?” i nodded assent, for i was so amazed that i hardly knew what to
 either think or say; it was hard to imagine that i had seen him eat up
 his spiders and flies not five minutes before. looking at my watch, i
 saw that i should go to the station to meet helsing, so i told mrs.
 harker that it was time to leave. she came at once, after saying
 pleasantly to mr. renfield: “good-bye, and i hope i may see you often,
 under auspices pleasanter to yourself,” to which, to my astonishment, he
 replied:--
 
“good-bye, my dear. i pray god i may never see your sweet face again.
 may bless and keep you!”
 
when i went to the station to meet helsing i left the boys behind
 me. poor art seemed more cheerful than has been since lucy first took
 ill, and quincey is more like his own bright self than has been for
 many long day.
 
helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
 boy. saw at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--
 
“ah, friend john, how goes all? well? so! i have been busy, for i come
 here to stay if need be. all affairs are settled with me, and i have
 much to tell. madam mina is with you? yes. and her so fine husband? and
 arthur and my friend quincey, they are with you, too? good!”
 
as i drove to the house i told him of what had passed, and of how my own
 diary had come to be of some use through mrs. harker’s suggestion; at
 which the professor interrupted me:--
 
“ah, that wonderful madam mina! she has man’s brain--a brain that man
 should have were much gifted--and woman’s heart. the good god
 fashioned her for purpose, believe me, when made that so good
 combination. friend john, up to now fortune has made that woman of help
 to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible
 affair. it is not good that she run risk so great. we men are
 determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is
 part for woman. even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her
 in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in
 waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. and, besides,
 she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to
 think of some time, if not now. you tell she has wrote all, then she
 must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and
 we go alone.” i agreed heartily with him, and then i told him what we
 had found in his absence: that the house which dracula had bought was
 the very next one to my own. was amazed, and great concern seemed
 to come on him. “oh that we had known it before!” said, “for then we
 might have reached him in time to save poor lucy. however, ‘the milk
 that is spilt cries not out afterwards,’ as you say. we shall not think
 of that, but go on our way to the end.” then fell into silence that
 lasted till we entered my own gateway. before we went to prepare for
 dinner said to mrs. harker:--
 
“i am told, madam mina, by my friend john that you and your husband have
 put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.”
 
“not up to this moment, professor,” she said impulsively, “but up to
 this morning.”
 
“but why not up to now? we have seen hitherto how good light all the
 little things have made. we have told our secrets, and yet one who
 has told is the worse for it.”
 
mrs. harker began to blush, and taking paper from her pockets, she
 said:--
 
“dr. helsing, will you read this, and tell if it must go in. it
 is my record of to-day. i too have seen the need of putting down at
 present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except
 what is personal. must it go in?” the professor read it over gravely,
 and handed it back, saying:--
 
“it need not go in if you do not wish it; but i pray that it may. it can
 but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more
 honour you--as well as more esteem and love.” she took it back with
 another blush and bright smile.
 
and so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete
 and in order. the professor took away one copy to study after dinner,
 and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o’clock. the rest of us
 have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all
 be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this
 terrible and mysterious enemy.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_30 september._--when we met in dr. seward’s study two hours after
 dinner, which had been at six o’clock, we unconsciously formed sort of
 board or committee. professor helsing took the head of the table, to
 which dr. seward motioned him as came into the room. made sit
 next to him on his right, and asked to act as secretary; jonathan sat
 next to me. opposite us were lord godalming, dr. seward, and mr.
 morris--lord godalming being next the professor, and dr. seward in the
 centre. the professor said:--
 
“i may, i suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts
 that are in these papers.” we all expressed assent, and went on:--
 
“then it were, i think good that i tell you something of the kind of
 enemy with which we have to deal. i shall then make known to you
 something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.
 so we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure
 according.
 
“there are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they
 exist. even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the
 teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane
 peoples. i admit that at the first i was sceptic. were it not that
 through long years i have train myself to keep an open mind, i could not
 have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. ‘see! see!
 i prove; i prove.’ alas! had i known at the first what now i know--nay,
 had i even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of
 us who did love her. but that is gone; and we must so work, that other
 poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. the _nosferatu_ do not die
 like the bee when sting once. is only stronger; and being
 stronger, have yet more power to work evil. this vampire which is
 amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; is of
 cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; have
 still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the
 divination by the dead, and all the dead that can come nigh to are
 for him at command; is brute, and more than brute; is devil in
 callous, and the heart of him is not; can, within limitations, appear
 at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he
 can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the
 thunder; can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and
 the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; can grow and become
 small; and can at times vanish and come unknown. how then are we to
 begin our strike to destroy him? how shall we find his where; and having
 found it, how can we destroy? my friends, this is much; it is terrible
 task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave
 shudder. for if we fail in this our fight must surely win; and then
 where end we? life is nothings; i heed him not. but to fail here, is not
 mere life or death. it is that we become as him; that we henceforward
 become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,
 preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. to us for
 ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?
 we go on for all time abhorred by all; blot on the face of god’s
 sunshine; an arrow in the side of him who died for man. but we are face
 to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? for me, i say, no;
 but then i am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his
 song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. you others are
 young. some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. what
 say you?”
 
whilst was speaking, jonathan had taken my hand. i feared, oh so
 much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when i
 saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to to feel its touch--so
 strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. brave man’s hand can speak for
 itself; it does not even need woman’s love to hear its music.
 
when the professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and i
 in his; there was need for speaking between us.
 
“i answer for mina and myself,” said.
 
“count in, professor,” said mr. quincey morris, laconically as usual.
 
“i am with you,” said lord godalming, “for lucy’s sake, if for other
 reason.”
 
dr. seward simply nodded. the professor stood up and, after laying his
 golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. i took
 his right hand, and lord godalming his left; jonathan held my right with
 his left and stretched across to mr. morris. so as we all took hands our
 solemn compact was made. i felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even
 occur to to draw back. we resumed our places, and dr. helsing
 went on with sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work
 had begun. it was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike way,
 as any other transaction of life:--
 
“well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not
 without strength. we have on our side power of combination--a power
 denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to
 act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.
 in fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are
 free to use them. we have self-devotion in cause, and an end to
 achieve which is not selfish one. these things are much.
 
“now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are
 restrict, and how the individual cannot. in fine, let us consider the
 limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.
 
“all we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. these do not
 at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay
 of more than either life or death. yet must we be satisfied; in the
 first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and
 secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and
 superstition--are everything. does not the belief in vampires rest for
 others--though not, alas! for us--on them? year ago which of us would
 have received such possibility, in the midst of our scientific,
 sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? we even scouted belief
 that we saw justified under our very eyes. take it, then, that the
 vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the
 moment on the same base. for, let tell you, is known everywhere
 that men have been. in old greece, in old rome; flourish in germany
 all over, in france, in india, even in the chernosese; and in china, so
 far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at
 this day. have follow the wake of the berserker icelander, the
 devil-begotten hun, the slav, the saxon, the magyar. so far, then, we
 have all we may act upon; and let tell you that very much of the
 beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy
 experience. the vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the
 time; can flourish when that can fatten on the blood of the
 living. even more, we have seen amongst us that can even grow
 younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though
 they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. but he
 cannot flourish without this diet; eat not as others. even friend
 jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!
 throws shadow; make in the mirror reflect, as again
 jonathan observe. has the strength of many of his hand--witness again
 jonathan when shut the door against the wolfs, and when help him
 from the diligence too. can transform himself to wolf, as we gather
 from the ship arrival in whitby, when tear open the dog; can be as
 bat, as madam mina saw him on the window at whitby, and as friend john
 saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend quincey saw him at
 the window of miss lucy. can come in mist which create--that noble
 ship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance
 can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. he
 come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again jonathan saw those
 sisters in the castle of dracula. become so small--we ourselves saw
 miss lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through hairbreadth space at the
 tomb door. can, when once find his way, come out from anything or
 into anything, matter how close it be bound or even fused up with
 fire--solder you call it. can see in the dark--no small power this,
 in world which is one half shut from the light. ah, but hear me
 through. can do all these things, yet is not free. nay; is even
 more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.
 cannot go where lists; who is not of nature has yet to obey
 some of nature’s laws--why we know not. may not enter anywhere at the
 first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;
 though afterwards can come as please. his power ceases, as does
 that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. only at certain times
 can have limited freedom. if be not at the place whither is
 bound, can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.
 these things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by
 inference. thus, whereas can do as will within his limit, when he
 have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place
 unhallowed, as we saw when went to the grave of the suicide at
 whitby; still at other time can only change when the time come. it is
 said, too, that can only pass running water at the slack or the flood
 of the tide. then there are things which so afflict him that has no
 power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this
 symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to
 them is nothing, but in their presence take his place far off and
 silent with respect. there are others, too, which i shall tell you of,
 lest in our seeking we may need them. the branch of wild rose on his
 coffin keep him that move not from it; sacred bullet fired into the
 coffin kill him so that be true dead; and as for the stake through
 him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.
 we have seen it with our eyes.
 
“thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine
 him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. but is
 clever. i have asked my friend arminius, of buda-pesth university, to
 make his record; and, from all the means that are, tell of what he
 has been. must, indeed, have been that voivode dracula who won his
 name against the turk, over the great river on the very frontier of
 turkey-land. if it be so, then was common man; for in that time,
 and for centuries after, was spoken of as the cleverest and the most
 cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the ‘land beyond the
 forest.’ that mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his
 grave, and are even now arrayed against us. the draculas were, says
 arminius, great and noble race, though now and again were scions who
 were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the evil one. they
 learned his secrets in the scholomance, amongst the mountains over lake
 hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. in the
 records are such words as ‘stregoica’--witch, ‘ordog,’ and
 ‘pokol’--satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very dracula is
 spoken of as ‘wampyr,’ which we all understand too well. there have been
 from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their
 graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. for it
 is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in
 all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.”
 
whilst they were talking mr. morris was looking steadily at the window,
 and now got up quietly, and went out of the room. there was little
 pause, and then the professor went on:--
 
“and now we must settle what we do. we have here much data, and we must
 proceed to lay out our campaign. we know from the inquiry of jonathan
 that from the castle to whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which
 were delivered at carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes
 have been removed. it seems to me, that our first step should be to
 ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall
 where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. if the
 latter, we must trace----”
 
here we were interrupted in very startling way. outside the house came
 the sound of pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a
 bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the
 far wall of the room. i am afraid i am at heart coward, for i shrieked
 out. the men all jumped to their feet; lord godalming flew over to the
 window and threw up the sash. as did so we heard mr. morris’s voice
 without:--
 
“sorry! i fear i have alarmed you. i shall come in and tell you about
 it.” minute later came in and said:--
 
“it was an idiotic thing of to do, and i ask your pardon, mrs.
 harker, most sincerely; i fear i must have frightened you terribly. but
 the fact is that whilst the professor was talking there came big bat
 and sat on the window-sill. i have got such horror of the damned
 brutes from recent events that i cannot stand them, and i went out to
 have shot, as i have been doing of late of evenings, whenever i have
 seen one. you used to laugh at for it then, art.”
 
“did you hit it?” asked dr. helsing.
 
“i don’t know; i fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.” without
 saying any more took his seat, and the professor began to resume his
 statement:--
 
“we must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must
 either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to
 speak, sterilise the earth, so that more can seek safety in it.
 thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of
 noon and sunset, and so engage with him when is at his most weak.
 
“and now for you, madam mina, this night is the end until all be well.
 you are too precious to us to have such risk. when we part to-night, you
 more must question. we shall tell you all in good time. we are men
 and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we
 shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we
 are.”
 
all the men, even jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me
 good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their
 safety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their
 minds were made up, and, though it was bitter pill for to swallow,
 i could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.
 
mr. morris resumed the discussion:--
 
“as there is time to lose, i vote we have look at his house right
 now. time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save
 another victim.”
 
i own that my heart began to fail when the time for action came so
 close, but i did not say anything, for i had greater fear that if i
 appeared as drag or hindrance to their work, they might even leave
 out of their counsels altogether. they have now gone off to carfax,
 with means to get into the house.
 
manlike, they had told to go to bed and sleep; as if woman can
 sleep when those she loves are in danger! i shall lie down and pretend
 to sleep, lest jonathan have added anxiety about when returns.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_1 october, 4 a. m._--just as we were about to leave the house, an
 urgent message was brought to from renfield to know if i would see
 him at once, as had something of the utmost importance to say to me.
 i told the messenger to say that i would attend to his wishes in the
 morning; i was busy just at the moment. the attendant added:--
 
“he seems very importunate, sir. i have never seen him so eager. i don’t
 know but what, if you don’t see him soon, will have one of his
 violent fits.” i knew the man would not have said this without some
 cause, so i said: “all right; i’ll go now”; and i asked the others to
 wait few minutes for me, as i had to go and see my “patient.”
 
“take with you, friend john,” said the professor. “his case in your
 diary interest much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_
 case. i should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is
 disturbed.”
 
“may i come also?” asked lord godalming.
 
“me too?” said quincey morris. “may i come?” said harker. i nodded, and
 we all went down the passage together.
 
we found him in state of considerable excitement, but far more
 rational in his speech and manner than i had ever seen him. there was an
 unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything i had ever
 met with in lunatic; and took it for granted that his reasons would
 prevail with others entirely sane. we all four went into the room, but
 none of the others at first said anything. his request was that i would
 at once release him from the asylum and send him home. this backed up
 with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own
 existing sanity. “i appeal to your friends,” said, “they will,
 perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. by the way, you have
 not introduced me.” i was so much astonished, that the oddness of
 introducing madman in an asylum did not strike at the moment; and,
 besides, there was certain dignity in the man’s manner, so much of
 the habit of equality, that i at once made the introduction: “lord
 godalming; professor helsing; mr. quincey morris, of texas; mr.
 renfield.” shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--
 
“lord godalming, i had the honour of seconding your father at the
 windham; i grieve to know, by your holding the title, that is no
 more. was man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his
 youth was, i have heard, the inventor of burnt rum punch, much
 patronised on derby night. mr. morris, you should be proud of your great
 state. its reception into the union was precedent which may have
 far-reaching effects hereafter, when the pole and the tropics may hold
 alliance to the stars and stripes. the power of treaty may yet prove a
 vast engine of enlargement, when the monroe doctrine takes its true
 place as political fable. what shall any man say of his pleasure at
 meeting helsing? sir, i make apology for dropping all forms of
 conventional prefix. when an individual has revolutionised therapeutics
 by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,
 conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to
 one of class. you, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by
 the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective
 places in the moving world, i take to witness that i am as sane as at
 least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.
 and i am sure that you, dr. seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as
 well as scientist, will deem it moral duty to deal with as one to
 be considered as under exceptional circumstances.” made this last
 appeal with courtly air of conviction which was not without its own
 charm.
 
i think we were all staggered. for my own part, i was under the
 conviction, despite my knowledge of the man’s character and history,
 that his reason had been restored; and i felt under strong impulse to
 tell him that i was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the
 necessary formalities for his release in the morning. i thought it
 better to wait, however, before making so grave statement, for of old
 i knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.
 so i contented myself with making general statement that appeared
 to be improving very rapidly; that i would have longer chat with him
 in the morning, and would then see what i could do in the direction of
 meeting his wishes. this did not at all satisfy him, for said
 quickly:--
 
“but i fear, dr. seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. i desire to
 go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if i may. time
 presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of
 the essence of the contract. i am sure it is only necessary to put
 before so admirable practitioner as dr. seward so simple, yet so
 momentous wish, to ensure its fulfilment.” looked at keenly, and
 seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised
 them closely. not meeting any sufficient response, went on:--
 
“is it possible that i have erred in my supposition?”
 
“you have,” i said frankly, but at the same time, as i felt, brutally.
 there was considerable pause, and then said slowly:--
 
“then i suppose i must only shift my ground of request. let ask for
 this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. i am content to implore
 in such case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. i
 am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, i
 assure you, take it from that they are good ones, sound and
 unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. could you look,
 sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which
 animate me. nay, more, you would count amongst the best and truest of
 your friends.” again looked at us all keenly. i had growing
 conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was
 but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let
 him go on little longer, knowing from experience that would, like
 all lunatics, give himself away in the end. helsing was gazing at
 him with look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting
 with the fixed concentration of his look. said to renfield in tone
 which did not surprise at the time, but only when i thought of it
 afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--
 
“can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free
 to-night? i will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,
 without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--dr.
 seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the
 privilege you seek.” shook his head sadly, and with look of
 poignant regret on his face. the professor went on:--
 
“come, sir, bethink yourself. you claim the privilege of reason in the
 highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete
 reasonableness. you do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since
 you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. if
 you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can
 we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? be wise, and help
 us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.” still shook
 his head as said:--
 
“dr. helsing, i have nothing to say. your argument is complete, and
 if i were free to speak i should not hesitate moment; but i am not my
 own master in the matter. i can only ask you to trust me. if i am
 refused, the responsibility does not rest with me.” i thought it was now
 time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so i went
 towards the door, simply saying:--
 
“come, my friends, we have work to do. good-night.”
 
as, however, i got near the door, new change came over the patient. he
 moved towards so quickly that for the moment i feared that was
 about to make another homicidal attack. my fears, however, were
 groundless, for held up his two hands imploringly, and made his
 petition in moving manner. as saw that the very excess of his
 emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old
 relations, became still more demonstrative. i glanced at helsing,
 and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so i became little more
 fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his
 efforts were unavailing. i had previously seen something of the same
 constantly growing excitement in him when had to make some request of
 which at the time had thought much, such, for instance, as when he
 wanted cat; and i was prepared to see the collapse into the same
 sullen acquiescence on this occasion. my expectation was not realised,
 for, when found that his appeal would not be successful, got into
 quite frantic condition. threw himself on his knees, and held up
 his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a
 torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his
 whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--
 
“let entreat you, dr. seward, oh, let implore you, to let out
 of this house at once. send away how you will and where you will;
 send keepers with with whips and chains; let them take in a
 strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to gaol; but let go
 out of this. you don’t know what you do by keeping here. i am
 speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. you don’t know
 whom you wrong, or how; and i may not tell. woe is me! i may not tell.
 by all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is
 lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the almighty, take out
 of this and save my soul from guilt! can’t you hear me, man? can’t you
 understand? will you never learn? don’t you know that i am sane and
 earnest now; that i am lunatic in mad fit, but sane man fighting
 for his soul? oh, hear me! hear me! let go! let go! let go!”
 
i thought that the longer this went on the wilder would get, and so
 would bring on fit; so i took him by the hand and raised him up.
 
“come,” i said sternly, “no more of this; we have had quite enough
 already. get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.”
 
suddenly stopped and looked at intently for several moments. then,
 without word, rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the
 bed. the collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as i had
 expected.
 
when i was leaving the room, last of our party, said to in a
 quiet, well-bred voice:--
 
“you will, i trust, dr. seward, do the justice to bear in mind, later
 on, that i did what i could to convince you to-night.”
 



chapter xix
 
jonathan harker’s journal
 

_1 october, 5 a. m._--i went with the party to the search with an easy
 mind, for i think i never saw mina so absolutely strong and well. i am
 so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.
 somehow, it was dread to that she was in this fearful business at
 all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and
 brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such way
 that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and
 that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. we were, i think, all a
 little upset by the scene with mr. renfield. when we came away from his
 room we were silent till we got back to the study. then mr. morris said
 to dr. seward:--
 
“say, jack, if that man wasn’t attempting bluff, is about the
 sanest lunatic i ever saw. i’m not sure, but i believe that had some
 serious purpose, and if had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a
 chance.” lord godalming and i were silent, but dr. helsing added:--
 
“friend john, you know more of lunatics than i do, and i’m glad of it,
 for i fear that if it had been to to decide i would before that last
 hysterical outburst have given him free. but we live and learn, and in
 our present task we must take chance, as my friend quincey would say.
 all is best as they are.” dr. seward seemed to answer them both in a
 dreamy kind of way:--
 
“i don’t know but that i agree with you. if that man had been an
 ordinary lunatic i would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he
 seems so mixed up with the count in an indexy kind of way that i am
 afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. i can’t forget how
 prayed with almost equal fervour for cat, and then tried to tear my
 throat out with his teeth. besides, called the count ‘lord and
 master,’ and may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.
 that horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help
 him, so i suppose isn’t above trying to use respectable lunatic. he
 certainly did seem earnest, though. i only hope we have done what is
 best. these things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,
 help to unnerve man.” the professor stepped over, and laying his hand
 on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--
 
“friend john, have fear. we are trying to do our duty in very sad
 and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. what else have we to
 hope for, except the pity of the good god?” lord godalming had slipped
 away for few minutes, but now returned. held up little silver
 whistle, as remarked:--
 
“that old place may be full of rats, and if so, i’ve got an antidote on
 call.” having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care
 to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone
 out. when we got to the porch the professor opened his bag and took out
 lot of things, which laid on the step, sorting them into four
 little groups, evidently one for each. then spoke:--
 
“my friends, we are going into terrible danger, and we need arms of
 many kinds. our enemy is not merely spiritual. remember that has the
 strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are
 of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not
 amenable to mere strength. stronger man, or body of men more strong
 in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him
 as we can be hurt by him. we must, therefore, guard ourselves from his
 touch. keep this near your heart”--as spoke lifted little silver
 crucifix and held it out to me, i being nearest to him--“put these
 flowers round your neck”--here handed to wreath of withered
 garlic blossoms--“for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this
 knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can
 fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,
 which we must not desecrate needless.” this was portion of sacred
 wafer, which put in an envelope and handed to me. each of the others
 was similarly equipped. “now,” said, “friend john, where are the
 skeleton keys? if so that we can open the door, we need not break house
 by the window, as before at miss lucy’s.”
 
dr. seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a
 surgeon standing him in good stead. presently got one to suit; after
 little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with rusty
 clang, shot back. we pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and
 it slowly opened. it was startlingly like the image conveyed to in
 dr. seward’s diary of the opening of miss westenra’s tomb; i fancy that
 the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they
 shrank back. the professor was the first to move forward, and stepped
 into the open door.
 
“_in manus tuas, domine!_” said, crossing himself as passed over
 the threshold. we closed the door behind us, lest when we should have
 lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. the
 professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it
 from within should we be in hurry making our exit. then we all lit our
 lamps and proceeded on our search.
 
the light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the
 rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great
 shadows. i could not for my life get away from the feeling that there
 was some one else amongst us. i suppose it was the recollection, so
 powerfully brought home to by the grim surroundings, of that terrible
 experience in transylvania. i think the feeling was common to us all,
 for i noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every
 sound and every new shadow, just as i felt myself doing.
 
the whole place was thick with dust. the floor was seemingly inches
 deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down
 my lamp i could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. the
 walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of
 spider’s webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old
 tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. on table in the
 hall was great bunch of keys, with time-yellowed label on each. they
 had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents
 in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the professor
 lifted them. turned to and said:--
 
“you know this place, jonathan. you have copied maps of it, and you know
 it at least more than we do. which is the way to the chapel?” i had an
 idea of its direction, though on my former visit i had not been able to
 get admission to it; so i led the way, and after few wrong turnings
 found myself opposite low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.
 “this is the spot,” said the professor as turned his lamp on small
 map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence
 regarding the purchase. with little trouble we found the key on the
 bunch and opened the door. we were prepared for some unpleasantness, for
 as we were opening the door faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale
 through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we
 encountered. none of the others had met the count at all at close
 quarters, and when i had seen him was either in the fasting stage of
 his existence in his rooms or, when was gloated with fresh blood, in
 ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and
 close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. there was
 an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler
 air. but as to the odour itself, how shall i describe it? it was not
 alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the
 pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had
 become itself corrupt. faugh! it sickens to think of it. every breath
 exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and
 intensified its loathsomeness.
 
under ordinary circumstances such stench would have brought our
 enterprise to an end; but this was ordinary case, and the high and
 terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us strength which rose
 above merely physical considerations. after the involuntary shrinking
 consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our
 work as though that loathsome place were garden of roses.
 
we made an accurate examination of the place, the professor saying as we
 began:--
 
“the first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then
 examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some
 clue as to what has become of the rest.” glance was sufficient to show
 how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was
 mistaking them.
 
there were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! once i got fright,
 for, seeing lord godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted
 door into the dark passage beyond, i looked too, and for an instant my
 heart stood still. somewhere, looking out from the shadow, i seemed to
 see the high lights of the count’s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the
 red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. it was only for moment, for,
 as lord godalming said, “i thought i saw face, but it was only the
 shadows,” and resumed his inquiry, i turned my lamp in the direction,
 and stepped into the passage. there was sign of any one; and as there
 were corners, doors, aperture of any kind, but only the solid
 walls of the passage, there could be hiding-place even for _him_. i
 took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.
 
few minutes later i saw morris step suddenly back from corner, which
 was examining. we all followed his movements with our eyes, for
 undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw whole mass
 of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. we all instinctively drew
 back. the whole place was becoming alive with rats.
 
for moment or two we stood appalled, all save lord godalming, who was
 seemingly prepared for such an emergency. rushing over to the great
 iron-bound oaken door, which dr. seward had described from the outside,
 and which i had seen myself, turned the key in the lock, drew the
 huge bolts, and swung the door open. then, taking his little silver
 whistle from his pocket, blew low, shrill call. it was answered
 from behind dr. seward’s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a
 minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.
 unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved i
 noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been
 taken out had been brought this way. but even in the minute that had
 elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. they seemed to
 swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their
 moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look
 like bank of earth set with fireflies. the dogs dashed on, but at the
 threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting
 their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. the rats were
 multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.
 
lord godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him
 on the floor. the instant his feet touched the ground seemed to
 recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. they fled before
 him so fast that before had shaken the life out of score, the other
 dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey
 ere the whole mass had vanished.
 
with their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for
 the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at
 their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in
 the air with vicious shakes. we all seemed to find our spirits rise.
 whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
 the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves
 in the open i know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to
 slip from us like robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something
 of its grim significance, though we did not slacken whit in our
 resolution. we closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and
 bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. we found
 nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all
 untouched save for my own footsteps when i had made my first visit.
 never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when
 we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been
 rabbit-hunting in summer wood.
 
the morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.
 dr. helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and
 locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket
 when had done.
 
“so far,” said, “our night has been eminently successful. harm has
 come to us such as i feared might be and yet we have ascertained how
 many boxes are missing. more than all do i rejoice that this, our
 first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been
 accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet madam mina or
 troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and
 smells of horror which she might never forget. one lesson, too, we have
 learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute
 beasts which are to the count’s command are yet themselves not amenable
 to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his
 call, just as from his castle top summon the wolves to your going and
 to that poor mother’s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell
 from the so little dogs of my friend arthur. we have other matters
 before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used
 his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.
 so be it that has gone elsewhere. good! it has given us opportunity
 to cry ‘check’ in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the
 stake of human souls. and now let us go home. the dawn is close at hand,
 and we have reason to be content with our first night’s work. it may be
 ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;
 but we must go on, and from danger shall we shrink.”
 
the house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who
 was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and low, moaning sound
 from renfield’s room. the poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,
 after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.
 
i came tiptoe into our own room, and found mina asleep, breathing so
 softly that i had to put my ear down to hear it. she looks paler than
 usual. i hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. i am truly
 thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our
 deliberations. it is too great strain for woman to bear. i did not
 think so at first, but i know better now. therefore i am glad that it is
 settled. there may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet
 to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she
 suspected that there was any concealment. henceforth our work is to be a
 sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all
 is finished, and the earth free from monster of the nether world. i
 daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such
 confidence as ours; but i must be resolute, and to-morrow i shall keep
 dark over to-night’s doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that
 has happened. i rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.
 
* * * * *
 
_1 october, later._--i suppose it was natural that we should have all
 overslept ourselves, for the day was busy one, and the night had no
 rest at all. even mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though i slept
 till the sun was high, i was awake before her, and had to call two or
 three times before she awoke. indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a
 few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at with sort of
 blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of bad dream. she
 complained little of being tired, and i let her rest till later in the
 day. we now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be
 that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace
 them all. such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the
 sooner the matter is attended to the better. i shall look up thomas
 snelling to-day.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_1 october._--it was towards noon when i was awakened by the professor
 walking into my room. was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it
 is quite evident that last night’s work has helped to take some of the
 brooding weight off his mind. after going over the adventure of the
 night suddenly said:--
 
“your patient interests much. may it be that with you i visit him
 this morning? or if that you are too occupy, i can go alone if it may
 be. it is new experience to to find lunatic who talk philosophy,
 and reason so sound.” i had some work to do which pressed, so i told him
 that if would go alone i would be glad, as then i should not have to
 keep him waiting; so i called an attendant and gave him the necessary
 instructions. before the professor left the room i cautioned him against
 getting any false impression from my patient. “but,” answered, “i
 want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live
 things. said to madam mina, as i see in your diary of yesterday, that
 had once had such belief. why do you smile, friend john?”
 
“excuse me,” i said, “but the answer is here.” i laid my hand on the
 type-written matter. “when our sane and learned lunatic made that very
 statement of how _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually
 nauseous with the flies and spiders which had eaten just before mrs.
 harker entered the room.” helsing smiled in turn. “good!” said.
 “your memory is true, friend john. i should have remembered. and yet it
 is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease
 such fascinating study. perhaps i may gain more knowledge out of the
 folly of this madman than i shall from the teaching of the most wise.
 who knows?” i went on with my work, and before long was through that in
 hand. it seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was
 helsing back in the study. “do i interrupt?” asked politely as he
 stood at the door.
 
“not at all,” i answered. “come in. my work is finished, and i am free.
 i can go with you now, if you like.
 
“it is needless; i have seen him!”
 
“well?”
 
“i fear that does not appraise at much. our interview was short.
 when i entered his room was sitting on stool in the centre, with
 his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen
 discontent. i spoke to him as cheerfully as i could, and with such a
 measure of respect as i could assume. made reply whatever. “don’t
 you know me?” i asked. his answer was not reassuring: “i know you well
 enough; you are the old fool helsing. i wish you would take yourself
 and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. damn all thick-headed
 dutchmen!” not word more would say, but sat in his implacable
 sullenness as indifferent to as though i had not been in the room at
 all. thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so
 clever lunatic; so i shall go, if i may, and cheer myself with few
 happy words with that sweet soul madam mina. friend john, it does
 rejoice unspeakable that she is more to be pained, more to be
 worried with our terrible things. though we shall much miss her help, it
 is better so.”
 
“i agree with you with all my heart,” i answered earnestly, for i did
 not want him to weaken in this matter. “mrs. harker is better out of it.
 things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have
 been in many tight places in our time; but it is place for woman,
 and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time
 infallibly have wrecked her.”
 
so helsing has gone to confer with mrs. harker and harker; quincey
 and art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. i
 shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_1 october._--it is strange to to be kept in the dark as i am to-day;
 after jonathan’s full confidence for so many years, to see him
 manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. this
 morning i slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though
 jonathan was late too, was the earlier. spoke to before went
 out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but never mentioned word of
 what had happened in the visit to the count’s house. and yet must
 have known how terribly anxious i was. poor dear fellow! i suppose it
 must have distressed him even more than it did me. they all agreed that
 it was best that i should not be drawn further into this awful work, and
 i acquiesced. but to think that keeps anything from me! and now i am
 crying like silly fool, when i _know_ it comes from my husband’s great
 love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.
 
that has done good. well, some day jonathan will tell all; and
 lest it should ever be that should think for moment that i kept
 anything from him, i still keep my journal as usual. then if has
 feared of my trust i shall show it to him, with every thought of my
 heart put down for his dear eyes to read. i feel strangely sad and
 low-spirited to-day. i suppose it is the reaction from the terrible
 excitement.
 
last night i went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told
 to. i didn’t feel sleepy, and i did feel full of devouring anxiety. i
 kept thinking over everything that has been ever since jonathan came to
 see in london, and it all seems like horrible tragedy, with fate
 pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. everything that one does
 seems, matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which
 is most to be deplored. if i hadn’t gone to whitby, perhaps poor dear
 lucy would be with us now. she hadn’t taken to visiting the churchyard
 till i came, and if she hadn’t come there in the day-time with she
 wouldn’t have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn’t gone there at
 night and asleep, that monster couldn’t have destroyed her as did.
 oh, why did i ever go to whitby? there now, crying again! i wonder what
 has come over to-day. i must hide it from jonathan, for if knew
 that i had been crying twice in one morning--i, who never cried on my
 own account, and whom has never caused to shed tear--the dear
 fellow would fret his heart out. i shall put bold face on, and if i do
 feel weepy, shall never see it. i suppose it is one of the lessons
 that we poor women have to learn....
 
i can’t quite remember how i fell asleep last night. i remember hearing
 the sudden barking of the dogs and lot of queer sounds, like praying
 on very tumultuous scale, from mr. renfield’s room, which is somewhere
 under this. and then there was silence over everything, silence so
 profound that it startled me, and i got up and looked out of the window.
 all was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight
 seeming full of silent mystery of their own. not thing seemed to be
 stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that thin
 streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness
 across the grass towards the house, seemed to have sentience and a
 vitality of its own. i think that the digression of my thoughts must
 have done good, for when i got back to bed i found lethargy
 creeping over me. i lay while, but could not quite sleep, so i got out
 and looked out of the window again. the mist was spreading, and was now
 close up to the house, so that i could see it lying thick against the
 wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. the poor man was
 more loud than ever, and though i could not distinguish word said,
 i could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on
 his part. then there was the sound of struggle, and i knew that the
 attendants were dealing with him. i was so frightened that i crept into
 bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.
 i was not then bit sleepy, at least so i thought; but i must have
 fallen asleep, for, except dreams, i do not remember anything until the
 morning, when jonathan woke me. i think that it took an effort and a
 little time to realise where i was, and that it was jonathan who was
 bending over me. my dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of
 the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.
 
i thought that i was asleep, and waiting for jonathan to come back. i
 was very anxious about him, and i was powerless to act; my feet, and my
 hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the
 usual pace. and so i slept uneasily and thought. then it began to dawn
 upon that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. i put back the
 clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim
 around. the gaslight which i had left lit for jonathan, but turned down,
 came only like tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently
 grown thicker and poured into the room. then it occurred to that i
 had shut the window before i had come to bed. i would have got out to
 make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my
 limbs and even my will. i lay still and endured; that was all. i closed
 my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (it is wonderful what
 tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) the
 mist grew thicker and thicker and i could see now how it came in, for i
 could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling
 water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of
 the door. it got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became
 concentrated into sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top
 of which i could see the light of the gas shining like red eye. things
 began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now
 whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words “a
 pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.” was it indeed some such
 spiritual guidance that was coming to in my sleep? but the pillar was
 composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the
 red eye, which at the thought got new fascination for me; till, as i
 looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on through the fog like
 two red eyes, such as lucy told of in her momentary mental wandering
 when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of st. mary’s
 church. suddenly the horror burst upon that it was thus that jonathan
 had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist
 in the moonlight, and in my dream i must have fainted, for all became
 black darkness. the last conscious effort which imagination made was to
 show livid white face bending over out of the mist. i must be
 careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one’s reason if there were
 too much of them. i would get dr. helsing or dr. seward to prescribe
 something for which would make sleep, only that i fear to alarm
 them. such dream at the present time would become woven into their
 fears for me. to-night i shall strive hard to sleep naturally. if i do
 not, i shall to-morrow night get them to give dose of chloral; that
 cannot hurt for once, and it will give good night’s sleep. last
 night tired more than if i had not slept at all.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 october 10 p. m._--last night i slept, but did not dream. i must have
 slept soundly, for i was not waked by jonathan coming to bed; but the
 sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day i feel terribly weak and
 spiritless. i spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.
 in the afternoon mr. renfield asked if might see me. poor man, was
 very gentle, and when i came away kissed my hand and bade god bless
 me. some way it affected much; i am crying when i think of him. this
 is new weakness, of which i must be careful. jonathan would be
 miserable if knew i had been crying. and the others were out till
 dinner-time, and they all came in tired. i did what i could to brighten
 them up, and i suppose that the effort did good, for i forgot how
 tired i was. after dinner they sent to bed, and all went off to smoke
 together, as they said, but i knew that they wanted to tell each other
 of what had occurred to each during the day; i could see from jonathan’s
 manner that had something important to communicate. i was not so
 sleepy as i should have been; so before they went i asked dr. seward to
 give little opiate of some kind, as i had not slept well the night
 before. very kindly made up sleeping draught, which gave to
 me, telling that it would do harm, as it was very mild.... i
 have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. i hope
 i have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, new fear
 comes: that i may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the
 power of waking. i might want it. here comes sleep. good-night.
 



chapter xx
 
jonathan harker’s journal
 

_1 october, evening._--i found thomas snelling in his house at bethnal
 green, but unhappily was not in condition to remember anything. the
 very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had
 proved too much, and had begun too early on his expected debauch. i
 learned, however, from his wife, who seemed decent, poor soul, that he
 was only the assistant to smollet, who of the two mates was the
 responsible person. so off i drove to walworth, and found mr. joseph
 smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking late tea out of a
 saucer. is decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly good, reliable
 type of workman, and with headpiece of his own. remembered all
 about the incident of the boxes, and from wonderful dog’s-eared
 notebook, which produced from some mysterious receptacle about the
 seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,
 half-obliterated pencil, gave the destinations of the boxes. there
 were, said, six in the cartload which took from carfax and left at
 197, chicksand street, mile end new town, and another six which he
 deposited at jamaica lane, bermondsey. if then the count meant to
 scatter these ghastly refuges of his over london, these places were
 chosen as the first of delivery, so that later might distribute more
 fully. the systematic manner in which this was done made think that
 could not mean to confine himself to two sides of london. was now
 fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern
 shore, and on the south. the north and west were surely never meant to
 be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the city itself and the
 very heart of fashionable london in the south-west and west. i went back
 to smollet, and asked him if could tell us if any other boxes had
 been taken from carfax.
 
replied:--
 
“well, guv’nor, you’ve treated wery ’an’some”--i had given him half a
 sovereign--“an’ i’ll tell yer all i know. i heard man by the name of
 bloxam say four nights ago in the ’are an’ ’ounds, in pincher’s alley,
 as ’ow an’ his mate ’ad ’ad rare dusty job in old ’ouse at
 purfect. there ain’t a-many such jobs as this ’ere, an’ i’m thinkin’
 that maybe sam bloxam could tell ye summut.” i asked if could tell me
 where to find him. i told him that if could get the address it
 would be worth another half-sovereign to him. so gulped down the rest
 of his tea and stood up, saying that was going to begin the search
 then and there. at the door stopped, and said:--
 
“look ’ere, guv’nor, there ain’t sense in a-keepin’ you ’ere. i
 may find sam soon, or i mayn’t; but anyhow ain’t like to be in way
 to tell ye much to-night. sam is rare one when starts on the booze.
 if you can give envelope with stamp on it, and put yer address on
 it, i’ll find out where sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. but
 ye’d better be up arter ’im soon in the mornin’, or maybe ye won’t ketch
 ’im; for sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore.”
 
this was all practical, so one of the children went off with penny to
 buy an envelope and sheet of paper, and to keep the change. when she
 came back, i addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when smollet had
 again faithfully promised to post the address when found, i took my way
 to home. we’re on the track anyhow. i am tired to-night, and want sleep.
 mina is fast asleep, and looks little too pale; her eyes look as
 though she had been crying. poor dear, i’ve doubt it frets her to be
 kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about and the
 others. but it is best as it is. it is better to be disappointed and
 worried in such way now than to have her nerve broken. the doctors
 were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful
 business. i must be firm, for on this particular burden of silence
 must rest. i shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any
 circumstances. indeed, it may not be hard task, after all, for she
 herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the
 count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 october, evening._--a long and trying and exciting day. by the first
 post i got my directed envelope with dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on
 which was written with carpenter’s pencil in sprawling hand:--
 
“sam bloxam, korkrans, 4, poters cort, bartel street, walworth. arsk for
 the depite.”
 
i got the letter in bed, and rose without waking mina. she looked heavy
 and sleepy and pale, and far from well. i determined not to wake her,
 but that, when i should return from this new search, i would arrange for
 her going back to exeter. i think she would be happier in our own home,
 with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and
 in ignorance. i only saw dr. seward for moment, and told him where i
 was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as i should
 have found out anything. i drove to walworth and found, with some
 difficulty, potter’s court. mr. smollet’s spelling misled me, as i asked
 for poter’s court instead of potter’s court. however, when i had found
 the court, i had difficulty in discovering corcoran’s lodging-house.
 when i asked the man who came to the door for the “depite,” shook his
 head, and said: “i dunno ’im. there ain’t such person ’ere; i never
 ’eard of ’im in all my bloomin’ days. don’t believe there ain’t nobody
 of that kind livin’ ere or anywheres.” i took out smollet’s letter, and
 as i read it it seemed to that the lesson of the spelling of the name
 of the court might guide me. “what are you?” i asked.
 
“i’m the depity,” answered. i saw at once that i was on the right
 track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. half-crown tip put the
 deputy’s knowledge at my disposal, and i learned that mr. bloxam, who
 had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at
 corcoran’s, had left for his work at poplar at five o’clock that
 morning. could not tell where the place of work was situated, but
 had vague idea that it was some kind of “new-fangled ware’us”;
 and with this slender clue i had to start for poplar. it was twelve
 o’clock before i got any satisfactory hint of such building, and this
 i got at coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. one
 of these suggested that there was being erected at cross angel street a
 new “cold storage” building; and as this suited the condition of a
 “new-fangled ware’us,” i at once drove to it. an interview with surly
 gatekeeper and surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the
 coin of the realm, put on the track of bloxam; was sent for on my
 suggesting that i was willing to pay his day’s wages to his foreman for
 the privilege of asking him few questions on private matter. was
 smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. when i had
 promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, told me
 that had made two journeys between carfax and house in piccadilly,
 and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--“main
 heavy ones”--with horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. i
 asked him if could tell the number of the house in piccadilly, to
 which replied:--
 
“well, guv’nor, i forgits the number, but it was only few doors from a
 big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. it was a
 dusty old ’ouse, too, though nothin’ to the dustiness of the ’ouse we
 tooked the bloomin’ boxes from.”
 
“how did you get into the houses if they were both empty?”
 
“there was the old party what engaged a-waitin’ in the ’ouse at
 purfleet. ’elped to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. curse
 me, but was the strongest chap i ever struck, an’ him old feller,
 with white moustache, one that thin you would think couldn’t throw
 shadder.”
 
how this phrase thrilled through me!
 
“why, ’e took up ’is end o’ the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and
 a-puffin’ an’ a-blowin’ afore i could up-end mine anyhow--an’ i’m no
 chicken, neither.”
 
“how did you get into the house in piccadilly?” i asked.
 
“he was there too. must ’a’ started off and got there afore me, for
 when i rung of the bell kem an’ opened the door ’isself an’ ’elped me
 to carry the boxes into the ’all.”
 
“the whole nine?” i asked.
 
“yus; there was five in the first load an’ four in the second. it was
 main dry work, an’ i don’t so well remember ’ow i got ’ome.” i
 interrupted him:--
 
“were the boxes left in the hall?”
 
“yus; it was big ’all, an’ there was nothin’ else in it.” i made one
 more attempt to further matters:--
 
“you didn’t have any key?”
 
“never used key nor nothink. the old gent, opened the door ’isself
 an’ shut it again when i druv off. i don’t remember the last time--but
 that was the beer.”
 
“and you can’t remember the number of the house?”
 
“no, sir. but ye needn’t have difficulty about that. it’s ’igh ’un
 with stone front with bow on it, an’ ’igh steps up to the door. i
 know them steps, ’avin’ ’ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers
 what come round to earn copper. the old gent give them shillin’s, an’
 they seein’ they got so much, they wanted more; but ’e took one of them
 by the shoulder and was like to throw ’im down the steps, till the lot
 of them went away cussin’.” i thought that with this description i could
 find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, i started
 off for piccadilly. i had gained new painful experience; the count
 could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. if so, time was
 precious; for, now that had achieved certain amount of
 distribution, could, by choosing his own time, complete the task
 unobserved. at piccadilly circus i discharged my cab, and walked
 westward; beyond the junior constitutional i came across the house
 described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs
 arranged by dracula. the house looked as though it had been long
 untenanted. the windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were
 up. all the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint
 had mostly scaled away. it was evident that up to lately there had been
 large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been
 roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.
 behind the rails of the balcony i saw there were some loose boards,
 whose raw edges looked white. i would have given good deal to have
 been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have
 given some clue to the ownership of the house. i remembered my
 experience of the investigation and purchase of carfax, and i could not
 but feel that if i could find the former owner there might be some means
 discovered of gaining access to the house.
 
there was at present nothing to be learned from the piccadilly side, and
 nothing could be done; so i went round to the back to see if anything
 could be gathered from this quarter. the mews were active, the
 piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. i asked one or two of the
 grooms and helpers whom i saw around if they could tell anything
 about the empty house. one of them said that heard it had lately been
 taken, but couldn’t say from whom. told me, however, that up to
 very lately there had been notice-board of “for sale” up, and that
 perhaps mitchell, sons, & candy, the house agents, could tell me
 something, as thought remembered seeing the name of that firm on
 the board. i did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know
 or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, i strolled
 away. it was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so i
 did not lose any time. having learned the address of mitchell, sons, &
 candy from directory at the berkeley, i was soon at their office in
 sackville street.
 
the gentleman who saw was particularly suave in manner, but
 uncommunicative in equal proportion. having once told that the
 piccadilly house--which throughout our interview called a
 “mansion”--was sold, considered my business as concluded. when i
 asked who had purchased it, opened his eyes thought wider, and
 paused few seconds before replying:--
 
“it is sold, sir.”
 
“pardon me,” i said, with equal politeness, “but i have special reason
 for wishing to know who purchased it.”
 
again paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. “it is sold,
 sir,” was again his laconic reply.
 
“surely,” i said, “you do not mind letting know so much.”
 
“but i do mind,” answered. “the affairs of their clients are
 absolutely safe in the hands of mitchell, sons, & candy.” this was
 manifestly prig of the first water, and there was use arguing with
 him. i thought i had best meet him on his own ground, so i said:--
 
“your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute guardian of their
 confidence. i am myself professional man.” here i handed him my card.
 “in this instance i am not prompted by curiosity; i act on the part of
 lord godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,
 understood, lately for sale.” these words put different complexion
 on affairs. said:--
 
“i would like to oblige you if i could, mr. harker, and especially would
 i like to oblige his lordship. we once carried out small matter of
 renting some chambers for him when was the honourable arthur
 holmwood. if you will let have his lordship’s address i will consult
 the house on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his
 lordship by to-night’s post. it will be pleasure if we can so far
 deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his
 lordship.”
 
i wanted to secure friend, and not to make an enemy, so i thanked him,
 gave the address at dr. seward’s and came away. it was now dark, and i
 was tired and hungry. i got cup of tea at the aërated bread company
 and came down to purfleet by the next train.
 
i found all the others at home. mina was looking tired and pale, but she
 made gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to
 think that i had had to keep anything from her and so caused her
 inquietude. thank god, this will be the last night of her looking on at
 our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our
 confidence. it took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of
 keeping her out of our grim task. she seems somehow more reconciled; or
 else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when
 any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. i am glad we
 made our resolution in time, as with such feeling as this, our growing
 knowledge would be torture to her.
 
i could not tell the others of the day’s discovery till we were alone;
 so after dinner--followed by little music to save appearances even
 amongst ourselves--i took mina to her room and left her to go to bed.
 the dear girl was more affectionate with than ever, and clung to me
 as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and i
 came away. thank god, the ceasing of telling things has made no
 difference between us.
 
when i came down again i found the others all gathered round the fire in
 the study. in the train i had written my diary so far, and simply read
 it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own
 information; when i had finished helsing said:--
 
“this has been great day’s work, friend jonathan. doubtless we are on
 the track of the missing boxes. if we find them all in that house, then
 our work is near the end. but if there be some missing, we must search
 until we find them. then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the
 wretch to his real death.” we all sat silent awhile and all at once mr.
 morris spoke:--
 
“say! how are we going to get into that house?”
 
“we got into the other,” answered lord godalming quickly.
 
“but, art, this is different. we broke house at carfax, but we had night
 and walled park to protect us. it will be mighty different thing to
 commit burglary in piccadilly, either by day or night. i confess i don’t
 see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us key
 of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the
 morning.” lord godalming’s brows contracted, and stood up and walked
 about the room. by-and-by stopped and said, turning from one to
 another of us:--
 
“quincey’s head is level. this burglary business is getting serious; we
 got off once all right; but we have now rare job on hand--unless we
 can find the count’s key basket.”
 
as nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at
 least advisable to wait till lord godalming should hear from mitchell’s,
 we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. for good
 while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and
 bearings; i took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the
 moment. i am very sleepy and shall go to bed....
 
just line. mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. her
 forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even
 in her sleep. she is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she
 did this morning. to-morrow will, i hope, mend all this; she will be
 herself at home in exeter. oh, but i am sleepy!
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_1 october._--i am puzzled afresh about renfield. his moods change so
 rapidly that i find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they
 always mean something more than his own well-being, they form more
 than interesting study. this morning, when i went to see him after his
 repulse of helsing, his manner was that of man commanding destiny.
 was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. did not really
 care for any of the things of mere earth; was in the clouds and
 looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. i
 thought i would improve the occasion and learn something, so i asked
 him:--
 
“what about the flies these times?” smiled on in quite superior
 sort of way--such smile as would have become the face of malvolio--as
 answered me:--
 
“the fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical
 of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. the ancients did well
 when they typified the soul as butterfly!”
 
i thought i would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so i said
 quickly:--
 
“oh, it is soul you are after now, is it?” his madness foiled his
 reason, and puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head
 with decision which i had but seldom seen in him, said:--
 
“oh, no, oh no! i want souls. life is all i want.” here brightened
 up; “i am pretty indifferent about it at present. life is all right; i
 have all i want. you must get new patient, doctor, if you wish to
 study zoöphagy!”
 
this puzzled little, so i drew him on:--
 
“then you command life; you are god, i suppose?” smiled with an
 ineffably benign superiority.
 
“oh no! far be it from to arrogate to myself the attributes of the
 deity. i am not even concerned in his especially spiritual doings. if i
 may state my intellectual position i am, so far as concerns things
 purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which enoch occupied
 spiritually!” this was poser to me. i could not at the moment recall
 enoch’s appositeness; so i had to ask simple question, though i felt
 that by so doing i was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--
 
“and why with enoch?”
 
“because walked with god.” i could not see the analogy, but did not
 like to admit it; so i harked back to what had denied:--
 
“so you don’t care about life and you don’t want souls. why not?” i put
 my question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.
 the effort succeeded; for an instant unconsciously relapsed into his
 old servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon as
 replied:--
 
“i don’t want any souls, indeed, indeed! i don’t. i couldn’t use them if
 i had them; they would be manner of use to me. i couldn’t eat them
 or----” suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his
 face, like wind-sweep on the surface of the water. “and doctor, as to
 life, what is it after all? when you’ve got all you require, and you
 know that you will never want, that is all. i have friends--good
 friends--like you, dr. seward”; this was said with leer of
 inexpressible cunning. “i know that i shall never lack the means of
 life!”
 
i think that through the cloudiness of his insanity saw some
 antagonism in me, for at once fell back on the last refuge of such as
 he--a dogged silence. after short time i saw that for the present it
 was useless to speak to him. was sulky, and so i came away.
 
later in the day sent for me. ordinarily i would not have come
 without special reason, but just at present i am so interested in him
 that i would gladly make an effort. besides, i am glad to have anything
 to help to pass the time. harker is out, following up clues; and so are
 lord godalming and quincey. helsing sits in my study poring over the
 record prepared by the harkers; seems to think that by accurate
 knowledge of all details will light upon some clue. does not wish
 to be disturbed in the work, without cause. i would have taken him with
 to see the patient, only i thought that after his last repulse he
 might not care to go again. there was also another reason: renfield
 might not speak so freely before third person as when and i were
 alone.
 
i found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, pose
 which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. when i
 came in, said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his
 lips:--
 
“what about souls?” it was evident then that my surmise had been
 correct. unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the
 lunatic. i determined to have the matter out. “what about them
 yourself?” i asked. did not reply for moment but looked all round
 him, and up and down, as though expected to find some inspiration for
 an answer.
 
“i don’t want any souls!” said in feeble, apologetic way. the
 matter seemed preying on his mind, and so i determined to use it--to “be
 cruel only to be kind.” so i said:--
 
“you like life, and you want life?”
 
“oh yes! but that is all right; you needn’t worry about that!”
 
“but,” i asked, “how are we to get the life without getting the soul
 also?” this seemed to puzzle him, so i followed it up:--
 
“a nice time you’ll have some time when you’re flying out there, with
 the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing
 and twittering and miauing all round you. you’ve got their lives, you
 know, and you must put up with their souls!” something seemed to affect
 his imagination, for put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,
 screwing them up tightly just as small boy does when his face is being
 soaped. there was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave
 lesson, for it seemed that before was child--only child,
 though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. it
 was evident that was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,
 and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign
 to himself, i thought i would enter into his mind as well as i could and
 go with him. the first step was to restore confidence, so i asked him,
 speaking pretty loud so that would hear through his closed ears:--
 
“would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?” seemed to
 wake up all at once, and shook his head. with laugh replied:--
 
“not much! flies are poor things, after all!” after pause added,
 “but i don’t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.”
 
“or spiders?” i went on.
 
“blow spiders! what’s the use of spiders? there isn’t anything in them
 to eat or”--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of forbidden
 topic.
 
“so, so!” i thought to myself, “this is the second time has suddenly
 stopped at the word ‘drink’; what does it mean?” renfield seemed himself
 aware of having made lapse, for hurried on, as though to distract
 my attention from it:--
 
“i don’t take any stock at all in such matters. ‘rats and mice and such
 small deer,’ as shakespeare has it, ‘chicken-feed of the larder’ they
 might be called. i’m past all that sort of nonsense. you might as well
 ask man to eat molecules with pair of chop-sticks, as to try to
 interest about the lesser carnivora, when i know of what is before
 me.”
 
“i see,” i said. “you want big things that you can make your teeth meet
 in? how would you like to breakfast on elephant?”
 
“what ridiculous nonsense you are talking!” was getting too wide
 awake, so i thought i would press him hard. “i wonder,” i said
 reflectively, “what an elephant’s soul is like!”
 
the effect i desired was obtained, for at once fell from his
 high-horse and became child again.
 
“i don’t want an elephant’s soul, or any soul at all!” said. for a
 few moments sat despondently. suddenly jumped to his feet, with
 his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. “to
 hell with you and your souls!” shouted. “why do you plague about
 souls? haven’t i got enough to worry, and pain, and distract already,
 without thinking of souls!” looked so hostile that i thought was
 in for another homicidal fit, so i blew my whistle. the instant,
 however, that i did so became calm, and said apologetically:--
 
“forgive me, doctor; i forgot myself. you do not need any help. i am so
 worried in my mind that i am apt to be irritable. if you only knew the
 problem i have to face, and that i am working out, you would pity, and
 tolerate, and pardon me. pray do not put in strait-waistcoat. i
 want to think and i cannot think freely when my body is confined. i am
 sure you will understand!” had evidently self-control; so when the
 attendants came i told them not to mind, and they withdrew. renfield
 watched them go; when the door was closed said, with considerable
 dignity and sweetness:--
 
“dr. seward, you have been very considerate towards me. believe that
 i am very, very grateful to you!” i thought it well to leave him in this
 mood, and so i came away. there is certainly something to ponder over in
 this man’s state. several points seem to make what the american
 interviewer calls “a story,” if one could only get them in proper order.
 here they are:--
 
will not mention “drinking.”
 
fears the thought of being burdened with the “soul” of anything.
 
has dread of wanting “life” in the future.
 
despises the meaner forms of life altogether, though dreads being
 haunted by their souls.
 
logically all these things point one way! has assurance of some kind
 that will acquire some higher life. dreads the consequence--the
 burden of soul. then it is human life looks to!
 
and the assurance--?
 
merciful god! the count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of
 terror afoot!
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--i went after my round to helsing and told him my
 suspicion. grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a
 while asked to take him to renfield. i did so. as we came to the door
 we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as used to do in the time
 which now seems so long ago. when we entered we saw with amazement that
 had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the
 autumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. we tried to make him talk
 of the subject of our previous conversation, but would not attend. he
 went on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. had
 got scrap of paper and was folding it into note-book. we had to come
 away as ignorant as we went in.
 
his is curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.
 

_letter, mitchell, sons and candy to lord godalming._
 
_“1 october._
 
“my lord,
 
“we are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. we beg, with
 regard to the desire of your lordship, expressed by mr. harker on your
 behalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and
 purchase of no. 347, piccadilly. the original vendors are the executors
 of the late mr. archibald winter-suffield. the purchaser is foreign
 nobleman, count ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the
 purchase money in notes ‘over the counter,’ if your lordship will pardon
 us using so vulgar an expression. beyond this we know nothing whatever
 of him.
 
“we are, my lord,
 
“your lordship’s humble servants,
 
“mitchell, sons & candy.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_2 october._--i placed man in the corridor last night, and told him to
 make an accurate note of any sound might hear from renfield’s room,
 and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he
 was to call me. after dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire
 in the study--mrs. harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts
 and discoveries of the day. harker was the only one who had any result,
 and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.
 
before going to bed i went round to the patient’s room and looked in
 through the observation trap. was sleeping soundly, and his heart
 rose and fell with regular respiration.
 
this morning the man on duty reported to that little after midnight
 was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. i asked him
 if that was all; replied that it was all heard. there was
 something about his manner so suspicious that i asked him point blank if
 had been asleep. denied sleep, but admitted to having “dozed” for
 while. it is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are
 watched.
 
to-day harker is out following up his clue, and art and quincey are
 looking after horses. godalming thinks that it will be well to have
 horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we
 seek there will be time to lose. we must sterilise all the imported
 earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the count at his
 weakest, and without refuge to fly to. helsing is off to the
 british museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. the old
 physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,
 and the professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be
 useful to us later.
 
i sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in
 strait-waistcoats.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--we have met again. we seem at last to be on the track, and our
 work of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. i wonder if
 renfield’s quiet has anything to do with this. his moods have so
 followed the doings of the count, that the coming destruction of the
 monster may be carried to him in some subtle way. if we could only get
 some hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument
 with him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a
 valuable clue. is now seemingly quiet for spell.... is he?---- that
 wild yell seemed to come from his room....
 
* * * * *
 
the attendant came bursting into my room and told that renfield had
 somehow met with some accident. had heard him yell; and when went
 to him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.
 i must go at once....
 



chapter xxi
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_3 october._--let put down with exactness all that happened, as well
 as i can remember it, since last i made an entry. not detail that i
 can recall must be forgotten; in all calmness i must proceed.
 
when i came to renfield’s room i found him lying on the floor on his
 left side in glittering pool of blood. when i went to move him, it
 became at once apparent that had received some terrible injuries;
 there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body
 which marks even lethargic sanity. as the face was exposed i could see
 that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the
 floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood
 originated. the attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to as
 we turned him over:--
 
“i think, sir, his back is broken. see, both his right arm and leg and
 the whole side of his face are paralysed.” how such thing could have
 happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. seemed quite
 bewildered, and his brows were gathered in as said:--
 
“i can’t understand the two things. could mark his face like that by
 beating his own head on the floor. i saw young woman do it once at the
 eversfield asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. and i suppose he
 might have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if got in an awkward
 kink. but for the life of i can’t imagine how the two things
 occurred. if his back was broke, couldn’t beat his head; and if his
 face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of
 it.” i said to him:--
 
“go to dr. helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. i want
 him without an instant’s delay.” the man ran off, and within few
 minutes the professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. when
 saw renfield on the ground, looked keenly at him moment, and
 then turned to me. i think recognised my thought in my eyes, for he
 said very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--
 
“ah, sad accident! will need very careful watching, and much
 attention. i shall stay with you myself; but i shall first dress myself.
 if you will remain i shall in few minutes join you.”
 
the patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that
 had suffered some terrible injury. helsing returned with
 extraordinary celerity, bearing with him surgical case. had
 evidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he
 looked at the patient, whispered to me:--
 
“send the attendant away. we must be alone with him when becomes
 conscious, after the operation.” so i said:--
 
“i think that will do now, simmons. we have done all that we can at
 present. you had better go your round, and dr. helsing will operate.
 let know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.”
 
the man withdrew, and we went into strict examination of the patient.
 the wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was depressed
 fracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. the
 professor thought moment and said:--
 
“we must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far
 as can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of
 his injury. the whole motor area seems affected. the suffusion of the
 brain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be
 too late.” as was speaking there was soft tapping at the door. i
 went over and opened it and found in the corridor without, arthur and
 quincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--
 
“i heard your man call up dr. helsing and tell him of an accident.
 so i woke quincey or rather called for him as was not asleep. things
 are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us
 these times. i’ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things
 as they have been. we’ll have to look back--and forward little more
 than we have done. may we come in?” i nodded, and held the door open
 till they had entered; then i closed it again. when quincey saw the
 attitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the
 floor, said softly:--
 
“my god! what has happened to him? poor, poor devil!” i told him
 briefly, and added that we expected would recover consciousness after
 the operation--for short time, at all events. went at once and sat
 down on the edge of the bed, with godalming beside him; we all watched
 in patience.
 
“we shall wait,” said helsing, “just long enough to fix the best
 spot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove
 the blood clot; for it is evident that the hæmorrhage is increasing.”
 
the minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. i had a
 horrible sinking in my heart, and from helsing’s face i gathered
 that felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. i dreaded
 the words that renfield might speak. i was positively afraid to think;
 but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as i have read of men
 who have heard the death-watch. the poor man’s breathing came in
 uncertain gasps. each instant seemed as though would open his eyes
 and speak; but then would follow prolonged stertorous breath, and he
 would relapse into more fixed insensibility. inured as i was to sick
 beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. i could almost
 hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my
 temples sounded like blows from hammer. the silence finally became
 agonising. i looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from
 their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal
 torture. there was nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead
 some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect
 it.
 
at last there came time when it was evident that the patient was
 sinking fast; might die at any moment. i looked up at the professor
 and caught his eyes fixed on mine. his face was sternly set as he
 spoke:--
 
“there is time to lose. his words may be worth many lives; i have
 been thinking so, as i stood here. it may be there is soul at stake!
 we shall operate just above the ear.”
 
without another word made the operation. for few moments the
 breathing continued to be stertorous. then there came breath so
 prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.
 suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in wild, helpless stare.
 this was continued for few moments; then it softened into glad
 surprise, and from the lips came sigh of relief. moved
 convulsively, and as did so, said:--
 
“i’ll be quiet, doctor. tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. i
 have had terrible dream, and it has left so weak that i cannot
 move. what’s wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts
 dreadfully.” tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his
 eyes seemed to grow glassy again so i gently put it back. then van
 helsing said in quiet grave tone:--
 
“tell us your dream, mr. renfield.” as heard the voice his face
 brightened, through its mutilation, and said:--
 
“that is dr. helsing. how good it is of you to be here. give some
 water, my lips are dry; and i shall try to tell you. i dreamed”--he
 stopped and seemed fainting, i called quietly to quincey--“the
 brandy--it is in my study--quick!” flew and returned with glass,
 the decanter of brandy and carafe of water. we moistened the parched
 lips, and the patient quickly revived. it seemed, however, that his poor
 injured brain had been working in the interval, for, when was quite
 conscious, looked at piercingly with an agonised confusion which i
 shall never forget, and said:--
 
“i must not deceive myself; it was dream, but all grim reality.”
 then his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two
 figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed went on:--
 
“if i were not sure already, i would know from them.” for an instant his
 eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though were
 bringing all his faculties to bear; when opened them said,
 hurriedly, and with more energy than had yet displayed:--
 
“quick, doctor, quick. i am dying! i feel that i have but few minutes;
 and then i must go back to death--or worse! wet my lips with brandy
 again. i have something that i must say before i die; or before my poor
 crushed brain dies anyhow. thank you! it was that night after you left
 me, when i implored you to let go away. i couldn’t speak then, for i
 felt my tongue was tied; but i was as sane then, except in that way, as
 i am now. i was in an agony of despair for long time after you left
 me; it seemed hours. then there came sudden peace to me. my brain
 seemed to become cool again, and i realised where i was. i heard the
 dogs bark behind our house, but not where was!” as spoke, van
 helsing’s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and
 gripped it hard. did not, however, betray himself; nodded slightly
 and said: “go on,” in low voice. renfield proceeded:--
 
“he came up to the window in the mist, as i had seen him often before;
 but was solid then--not ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a
 man’s when angry. was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white
 teeth glinted in the moonlight when turned to look back over the belt
 of trees, to where the dogs were barking. i wouldn’t ask him to come in
 at first, though i knew wanted to--just as had wanted all along.
 then began promising things--not in words but by doing them.” he
 was interrupted by word from the professor:--
 
“how?”
 
“by making them happen; just as used to send in the flies when the
 sun was shining. great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their
 wings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their
 backs.” helsing nodded to him as whispered to unconsciously:--
 
“the _acherontia aitetropos of the sphinges_--what you call the
 ‘death’s-head moth’?” the patient went on without stopping.
 
“then began to whisper: ‘rats, rats, rats! hundreds, thousands,
 millions of them, and every one life; and dogs to eat them, and cats
 too. all lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely
 buzzing flies!’ i laughed at him, for i wanted to see what could do.
 then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in his house. he
 beckoned to the window. i got up and looked out, and raised his
 hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. dark mass
 spread over the grass, coming on like the shape of flame of fire; and
 then moved the mist to the right and left, and i could see that there
 were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like his, only
 smaller. held up his hand, and they all stopped; and i thought he
 seemed to be saying: ‘all these lives will i give you, ay, and many more
 and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship
 me!’ and then red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close
 over my eyes; and before i knew what i was doing, i found myself opening
 the sash and saying to him: ‘come in, lord and master!’ the rats were
 all gone, but slid into the room through the sash, though it was only
 open an inch wide--just as the moon herself has often come in through
 the tiniest crack and has stood before in all her size and
 splendour.”
 
his voice was weaker, so i moistened his lips with the brandy again, and
 continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in
 the interval for his story was further advanced. i was about to call him
 back to the point, but helsing whispered to me: “let him go on. do
 not interrupt him; cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all
 if once lost the thread of his thought.” proceeded:--
 
“all day i waited to hear from him, but did not send anything, not
 even blow-fly, and when the moon got up i was pretty angry with him.
 when slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even
 knock, i got mad with him. sneered at me, and his white face looked
 out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and went on as though he
 owned the whole place, and i was one. didn’t even smell the same
 as went by me. i couldn’t hold him. i thought that, somehow, mrs.
 harker had come into the room.”
 
the two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind
 him so that could not see them, but where they could hear better.
 they were both silent, but the professor started and quivered; his face,
 however, grew grimmer and sterner still. renfield went on without
 noticing:--
 
“when mrs. harker came in to see this afternoon she wasn’t the same;
 it was like tea after the teapot had been watered.” here we all moved,
 but one said word; went on:--
 
“i didn’t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn’t look the
 same. i don’t care for the pale people; i like them with lots of blood
 in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. i didn’t think of it
 at the time; but when she went away i began to think, and it made mad
 to know that had been taking the life out of her.” i could feel that
 the rest quivered, as i did, but we remained otherwise still. “so when
 came to-night i was ready for him. i saw the mist stealing in, and i
 grabbed it tight. i had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and
 as i knew i was madman--at times anyhow--i resolved to use my power.
 ay, and felt it too, for had to come out of the mist to struggle
 with me. i held tight; and i thought i was going to win, for i didn’t
 mean him to take any more of her life, till i saw his eyes. they burned
 into me, and my strength became like water. slipped through it, and
 when i tried to cling to him, raised up and flung down. there
 was red cloud before me, and noise like thunder, and the mist seemed
 to steal away under the door.” his voice was becoming fainter and his
 breath more stertorous. helsing stood up instinctively.
 
“we know the worst now,” said. “he is here, and we know his purpose.
 it may not be too late. let us be armed--the same as we were the other
 night, but lose time; there is not an instant to spare.” there was no
 need to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in
 common. we all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we
 had when we entered the count’s house. the professor had his ready, and
 as we met in the corridor pointed to them significantly as said:--
 
“they never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is
 over. be wise also, my friends. it is common enemy that we deal with.
 alas! alas! that that dear madam mina should suffer!” stopped; his
 voice was breaking, and i do not know if rage or terror predominated in
 my own heart.
 
outside the harkers’ door we paused. art and quincey held back, and the
 latter said:--
 
“should we disturb her?”
 
“we must,” said helsing grimly. “if the door be locked, i shall
 break it in.”
 
“may it not frighten her terribly? it is unusual to break into lady’s
 room!”
 
helsing said solemnly, “you are always right; but this is life and
 death. all chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they
 are all as one to to-night. friend john, when i turn the handle, if
 the door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you
 too, my friends. now!”
 
turned the handle as spoke, but the door did not yield. we threw
 ourselves against it; with crash it burst open, and we almost fell
 headlong into the room. the professor did actually fall, and i saw
 across him as gathered himself up from hands and knees. what i saw
 appalled me. i felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,
 and my heart seemed to stand still.
 
the moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room
 was light enough to see. on the bed beside the window lay jonathan
 harker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in stupor.
 kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad
 figure of his wife. by her side stood tall, thin man, clad in black.
 his face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised
 the count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. with his left
 hand held both mrs. harker’s hands, keeping them away with her arms
 at full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,
 forcing her face down on his bosom. her white nightdress was smeared
 with blood, and thin stream trickled down the man’s bare breast which
 was shown by his torn-open dress. the attitude of the two had terrible
 resemblance to child forcing kitten’s nose into saucer of milk to
 compel it to drink. as we burst into the room, the count turned his
 face, and the hellish look that i had heard described seemed to leap
 into it. his eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils
 of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the
 white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,
 champed together like those of wild beast. with wrench, which threw
 his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from height, turned
 and sprang at us. but by this time the professor had gained his feet,
 and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the sacred
 wafer. the count suddenly stopped, just as poor lucy had done outside
 the tomb, and cowered back. further and further back cowered, as we,
 lifting our crucifixes, advanced. the moonlight suddenly failed, as a
 great black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up
 under quincey’s match, we saw nothing but faint vapour. this, as we
 looked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting
 open, had swung back to its old position. helsing, art, and i moved
 forward to mrs. harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with
 it had given scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it
 seems to now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. for a
 few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. her face was
 ghastly, with pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared
 her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled thin stream of
 blood; her eyes were mad with terror. then she put before her face her
 poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the
 count’s terrible grip, and from behind them came low desolate wail
 which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an
 endless grief. helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently
 over her body, whilst art, after looking at her face for an instant
 despairingly, ran out of the room. helsing whispered to me:--
 
“jonathan is in stupor such as we know the vampire can produce. we can
 do nothing with poor madam mina for few moments till she recovers
 herself; i must wake him!” dipped the end of towel in cold water
 and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while
 holding her face between her hands and sobbing in way that was
 heart-breaking to hear. i raised the blind, and looked out of the
 window. there was much moonshine; and as i looked i could see quincey
 morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of great
 yew-tree. it puzzled to think why was doing this; but at the
 instant i heard harker’s quick exclamation as woke to partial
 consciousness, and turned to the bed. on his face, as there might well
 be, was look of wild amazement. seemed dazed for few seconds, and
 then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he
 started up. his wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to
 him with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,
 however, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held
 her hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.
 
“in god’s name what does this mean?” harker cried out. “dr. seward, dr.
 helsing, what is it? what has happened? what is wrong? mina, dear,
 what is it? what does that blood mean? my god, my god! has it come to
 this!” and, raising himself to his knees, beat his hands wildly
 together. “good god help us! help her! oh, help her!” with quick
 movement jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the
 man in him awake at the need for instant exertion. “what has happened?
 tell all about it!” cried without pausing. “dr. helsing, you
 love mina, i know. oh, do something to save her. it cannot have gone too
 far yet. guard her while i look for _him_!” his wife, through her terror
 and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly
 forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--
 
“no! no! jonathan, you must not leave me. i have suffered enough
 to-night, god knows, without the dread of his harming you. you must stay
 with me. stay with these friends who will watch over you!” her
 expression became frantic as she spoke; and, yielding to her, she
 pulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.
 
helsing and i tried to calm them both. the professor held up his
 little golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--
 
“do not fear, my dear. we are here; and whilst this is close to you no
 foul thing can approach. you are safe for to-night; and we must be calm
 and take counsel together.” she shuddered and was silent, holding down
 her head on her husband’s breast. when she raised it, his white
 night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where
 the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. the instant she
 saw it she drew back, with low wail, and whispered, amidst choking
 sobs:--
 
“unclean, unclean! i must touch him or kiss him more. oh, that it
 should be that it is i who am now his worst enemy, and whom may have
 most cause to fear.” to this spoke out resolutely:--
 
“nonsense, mina. it is shame to to hear such word. i would not
 hear it of you; and i shall not hear it from you. may god judge by my
 deserts, and punish with more bitter suffering than even this hour,
 if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!” put out
 his arms and folded her to his breast; and for while she lay there
 sobbing. looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked
 damply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. after a
 while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then said to
 me, speaking with studied calmness which i felt tried his nervous
 power to the utmost:--
 
“and now, dr. seward, tell all about it. too well i know the broad
 fact; tell all that has been.” i told him exactly what had happened,
 and listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched
 and his eyes blazed as i told how the ruthless hands of the count had
 held his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to
 the open wound in his breast. it interested me, even at that moment, to
 see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over
 the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled
 hair. just as i had finished, quincey and godalming knocked at the door.
 they entered in obedience to our summons. helsing looked at me
 questioningly. i understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of
 their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband
 and wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence
 to him asked them what they had seen or done. to which lord godalming
 answered:--
 
“i could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. i
 looked in the study but, though had been there, had gone. had,
 however----” stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on
 the bed. helsing said gravely:--
 
“go on, friend arthur. we want here more concealments. our hope now
 is in knowing all. tell freely!” so art went on:--
 
“he had been there, and though it could only have been for few
 seconds, made rare of the place. all the manuscript had been
 burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the
 cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax
 had helped the flames.” here i interrupted. “thank god there is the
 other copy in the safe!” his face lit for moment, but fell again as he
 went on: “i ran downstairs then, but could see sign of him. i looked
 into renfield’s room; but there was trace there except----!” again he
 paused. “go on,” said harker hoarsely; so bowed his head and
 moistening his lips with his tongue, added: “except that the poor fellow
 is dead.” mrs. harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of
 us she said solemnly:--
 
“god’s will be done!” i could not but feel that art was keeping back
 something; but, as i took it that it was with purpose, i said nothing.
 helsing turned to morris and asked:--
 
“and you, friend quincey, have you any to tell?”
 
“a little,” answered. “it may be much eventually, but at present i
 can’t say. i thought it well to know if possible where the count would
 go when left the house. i did not see him; but i saw bat rise from
 renfield’s window, and flap westward. i expected to see him in some
 shape go back to carfax; but evidently sought some other lair. he
 will not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the
 dawn is close. we must work to-morrow!”
 
said the latter words through his shut teeth. for space of perhaps
 couple of minutes there was silence, and i could fancy that i could
 hear the sound of our hearts beating; then helsing said, placing his
 hand very tenderly on mrs. harker’s head:--
 
“and now, madam mina--poor, dear, dear madam mina--tell us exactly what
 happened. god knows that i do not want that you be pained; but it is
 need that we know all. for now more than ever has all work to be done
 quick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. the day is close to us that must
 end all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and
 learn.”
 
the poor, dear lady shivered, and i could see the tension of her nerves
 as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and
 lower still on his breast. then she raised her head proudly, and held
 out one hand to helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and
 kissing it reverently, held it fast. the other hand was locked in that
 of her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.
 after pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she
 began:--
 
“i took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a
 long time it did not act. i seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads
 of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them
 connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.”
 her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said
 lovingly: “do not fret, dear. you must be brave and strong, and help me
 through the horrible task. if you only knew what an effort it is to me
 to tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much i
 need your help. well, i saw i must try to help the medicine to its work
 with my will, if it was to do any good, so i resolutely set myself to
 sleep. sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for i remember no
 more. jonathan coming in had not waked me, for lay by my side when
 next i remember. there was in the room the same thin white mist that i
 had before noticed. but i forget now if you know of this; you will find
 it in my diary which i shall show you later. i felt the same vague
 terror which had come to before and the same sense of some presence.
 i turned to wake jonathan, but found that slept so soundly that it
 seemed as if it was who had taken the sleeping draught, and not i. i
 tried, but i could not wake him. this caused great fear, and i
 looked around terrified. then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside
 the bed, as if had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist
 had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a
 tall, thin man, all in black. i knew him at once from the description of
 the others. the waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light
 fell in thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white
 teeth showing between; and the red eyes that i had seemed to see in the
 sunset on the windows of st. mary’s church at whitby. i knew, too, the
 red scar on his forehead where jonathan had struck him. for an instant
 my heart stood still, and i would have screamed out, only that i was
 paralysed. in the pause spoke in sort of keen, cutting whisper,
 pointing as spoke to jonathan:--
 
“‘silence! if you make sound i shall take him and dash his brains out
 before your very eyes.’ i was appalled and was too bewildered to do or
 say anything. with mocking smile, placed one hand upon my shoulder
 and, holding tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as did
 so, ‘first, little refreshment to reward my exertions. you may as well
 be quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have
 appeased my thirst!’ i was bewildered, and, strangely enough, i did not
 want to hinder him. i suppose it is part of the horrible curse that
 such is, when his touch is on his victim. and oh, my god, my god, pity
 me! placed his reeking lips upon my throat!” her husband groaned
 again. she clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if
 were the injured one, and went on:--
 
“i felt my strength fading away, and i was in half swoon. how long
 this horrible thing lasted i know not; but it seemed that long time
 must have passed before took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. i
 saw it drip with the fresh blood!” the remembrance seemed for while to
 overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her
 husband’s sustaining arm. with great effort she recovered herself and
 went on:--
 
“then spoke to mockingly, ‘and so you, like the others, would play
 your brains against mine. you would help these men to hunt and
 frustrate in my designs! you know now, and they know in part already,
 and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. they
 should have kept their energies for use closer to home. whilst they
 played wits against me--against who commanded nations, and intrigued
 for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were
 born--i was countermining them. and you, their best beloved one, are now
 to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful
 wine-press for while; and shall be later on my companion and my
 helper. you shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall
 minister to your needs. but as yet you are to be punished for what you
 have done. you have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my
 call. when my brain says “come!” to you, you shall cross land or to
 do my bidding; and to that end this!’ with that pulled open his
 shirt, and with his long sharp nails opened vein in his breast. when
 the blood began to spurt out, took my hands in one of his, holding
 them tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to
 the wound, so that i must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- oh
 my god! my god! what have i done? what have i done to deserve such a
 fate, i who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my
 days. god pity me! look down on poor soul in worse than mortal peril;
 and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!” then she began to rub her
 lips as though to cleanse them from pollution.
 
as she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,
 and everything became more and more clear. harker was still and quiet;
 but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came grey look
 which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first
 red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out
 against the whitening hair.
 
we have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy
 pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.
 
of this i am sure: the sun rises to-day on more miserable house in
 all the great round of its daily course.
 



chapter xxii
 
jonathan harker’s journal
 

_3 october._--as i must do something or go mad, i write this diary. it
 is now six o’clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and
 take something to eat; for dr. helsing and dr. seward are agreed
 that if we do not eat we cannot work our best. our best will be, god
 knows, required to-day. i must keep writing at every chance, for i dare
 not stop to think. all, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end
 the little things may teach us most. the teaching, big or little, could
 not have landed mina or anywhere worse than we are to-day. however,
 we must trust and hope. poor mina told just now, with the tears
 running down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our
 faith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that god will aid us
 up to the end. the end! oh my god! what end?... to work! to work!
 
when dr. helsing and dr. seward had come back from seeing poor
 renfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. first, dr. seward
 told us that when and dr. helsing had gone down to the room below
 they had found renfield lying on the floor, all in heap. his face was
 all bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.
 
dr. seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if had
 heard anything. said that had been sitting down--he confessed to
 half dozing--when heard loud voices in the room, and then renfield
 had called out loudly several times, “god! god! god!” after that there
 was sound of falling, and when entered the room found him lying
 on the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. helsing
 asked if had heard “voices” or “a voice,” and said could not
 say; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as
 there was one in the room it could have been only one. could swear
 to it, if required, that the word “god” was spoken by the patient. dr.
 seward said to us, when we were alone, that did not wish to go into
 the matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it
 would never do to put forward the truth, as one would believe it. as
 it was, thought that on the attendant’s evidence could give a
 certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. in case the
 coroner should demand it, there would be formal inquest, necessarily
 to the same result.
 
when the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next
 step, the very first thing we decided was that mina should be in full
 confidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be
 kept from her. she herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful
 to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such depth of
 despair. “there must be concealment,” she said, “alas! we have had
 too much already. and besides there is nothing in all the world that can
 give more pain than i have already endured--than i suffer now!
 whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!”
 helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly
 but quietly:--
 
“but dear madam mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for
 others from yourself, after what has happened?” her face grew set in its
 lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of martyr as she
 answered:--
 
“ah no! for my mind is made up!”
 
“to what?” asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in
 our own way we had sort of vague idea of what she meant. her answer
 came with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating fact:--
 
“because if i find in myself--and i shall watch keenly for it--a sign of
 harm to any that i love, i shall die!”
 
“you would not kill yourself?” asked, hoarsely.
 
“i would; if there were friend who loved me, who would save such a
 pain, and so desperate an effort!” she looked at him meaningly as she
 spoke. was sitting down; but now rose and came close to her and
 put his hand on her head as said solemnly:
 
“my child, there is such an one if it were for your good. for myself i
 could hold it in my account with god to find such an euthanasia for you,
 even at this moment if it were best. nay, were it safe! but my
 child----” for moment seemed choked, and great sob rose in his
 throat; gulped it down and went on:--
 
“there are here some who would stand between you and death. you must not
 die. you must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. until
 the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not
 die; for if is still with the quick un-dead, your death would make
 you even as is. no, you must live! you must struggle and strive to
 live, though death would seem boon unspeakable. you must fight death
 himself, though come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the
 night; in safety or in peril! on your living soul i charge you that you
 do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.” the
 poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as i have seen a
 quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. we were all
 silent; we could do nothing. at length she grew more calm and turning to
 him said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--
 
“i promise you, my dear friend, that if god will let live, i shall
 strive to do so; till, if it may be in his good time, this horror may
 have passed away from me.” she was so good and brave that we all felt
 that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we
 began to discuss what we were to do. i told her that she was to have all
 the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we
 might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.
 she was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if “pleased” could
 be used in connection with so grim an interest.
 
as usual helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was
 prepared with an exact ordering of our work.
 
“it is perhaps well,” said, “that at our meeting after our visit to
 carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay
 there. had we done so, the count must have guessed our purpose, and
 would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an
 effort with regard to the others; but now does not know our
 intentions. nay, more, in all probability, does not know that such a
 power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that cannot use
 them as of old. we are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as
 to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in
 piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. to-day, then, is ours;
 and in it rests our hope. the sun that rose on our sorrow this morning
 guards us in its course. until it sets to-night, that monster must
 retain whatever form now has. is confined within the limitations
 of his earthly envelope. cannot melt into thin air nor disappear
 through cracks or chinks or crannies. if go through doorway, he
 must open the door like mortal. and so we have this day to hunt out
 all his lairs and sterilise them. so we shall, if we have not yet catch
 him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching
 and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.” here i started up for i
 could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so
 preciously laden with mina’s life and happiness were flying from us,
 since whilst we talked action was impossible. but helsing held up
 his hand warningly. “nay, friend jonathan,” said, “in this, the
 quickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. we shall all
 act and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. but think, in
 all probable the key of the situation is in that house in piccadilly.
 the count may have many houses which has bought. of them will have
 deeds of purchase, keys and other things. will have paper that he
 write on; will have his book of cheques. there are many belongings
 that must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,
 where come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the
 very vast of the traffic there is none to notice. we shall go there and
 search that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our
 friend arthur call, in his phrases of hunt ‘stop the earths’ and so we
 run down our old fox--so? is it not?”
 
“then let us come at once,” i cried, “we are wasting the precious,
 precious time!” the professor did not move, but simply said:--
 
“and how are we to get into that house in piccadilly?”
 
“any way!” i cried. “we shall break in if need be.”
 
“and your police; where will they be, and what will they say?”
 
i was staggered; but i knew that if wished to delay had good
 reason for it. so i said, as quietly as i could:--
 
“don’t wait more than need be; you know, i am sure, what torture i am
 in.”
 
“ah, my child, that i do; and indeed there is wish of to add to
 your anguish. but just think, what can we do, until all the world be at
 movement. then will come our time. i have thought and thought, and it
 seems to that the simplest way is the best of all. now we wish to get
 into the house, but we have key; is it not so?” i nodded.
 
“now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could
 not still get in; and think there was to you conscience of the
 housebreaker, what would you do?”
 
“i should get respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the
 lock for me.”
 
“and your police, they would interfere, would they not?”
 
“oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.”
 
“then,” looked at as keenly as spoke, “all that is in doubt is
 the conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to
 whether or that employer has good conscience or bad one. your
 police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading
 the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. no, no, my
 friend jonathan, you go take the lock off hundred empty house in this
 your london, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as such
 things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done,
 one will interfere. i have read of gentleman who owned so fine
 house in london, and when went for months of summer to switzerland
 and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at back and
 got in. then went and made open the shutters in front and walk out
 and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. then he
 have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice;
 and when the day come sell off by great auctioneer all the goods of
 that other man who own them. then go to builder, and sell him
 that house, making an agreement that pull it down and take all away
 within certain time. and your police and other authority help him all
 they can. and when that owner come back from his holiday in switzerland
 find only an empty hole where his house had been. this was all done
 _en règle_; and in our work we shall be _en règle_ too. we shall not go
 so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem
 it strange; but we shall go after ten o’clock, when there are many
 about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the
 house.”
 
i could not but see how right was and the terrible despair of mina’s
 face became relaxed thought; there was hope in such good counsel. van
 helsing went on:--
 
“when once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of
 us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be
 more earth-boxes--at bermondsey and mile end.”
 
lord godalming stood up. “i can be of some use here,” said. “i shall
 wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most
 convenient.”
 
“look here, old fellow,” said morris, “it is capital idea to have all
 ready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don’t you think that one
 of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in byway of
 walworth or mile end would attract too much attention for our purposes?
 it seems to that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and
 even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.”
 
“friend quincey is right!” said the professor. “his head is what you
 call in plane with the horizon. it is difficult thing that we go to
 do, and we do not want peoples to watch us if so it may.”
 
mina took growing interest in everything and i was rejoiced to see
 that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for time the
 terrible experience of the night. she was very, very pale--almost
 ghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in
 somewhat of prominence. i did not mention this last, lest it should give
 her needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of
 what had occurred with poor lucy when the count had sucked her blood. as
 yet there was sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet
 was short, and there was time for fear.
 
when we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the
 disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt. it was
 finally agreed that before starting for piccadilly we should destroy the
 count’s lair close at hand. in case should find it out too soon, we
 should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his
 presence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us
 some new clue.
 
as to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the professor that,
 after our visit to carfax, we should all enter the house in piccadilly;
 that the two doctors and i should remain there, whilst lord godalming
 and quincey found the lairs at walworth and mile end and destroyed them.
 it was possible, if not likely, the professor urged, that the count
 might appear in piccadilly during the day, and that if so we might be
 able to cope with him then and there. at any rate, we might be able to
 follow him in force. to this plan i strenuously objected, and so far as
 my going was concerned, for i said that i intended to stay and protect
 mina, i thought that my mind was made up on the subject; but mina would
 not listen to my objection. she said that there might be some law matter
 in which i could be useful; that amongst the count’s papers might be
 some clue which i could understand out of my experience in transylvania;
 and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster was required to
 cope with the count’s extraordinary power. i had to give in, for mina’s
 resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last hope for _her_ that
 we should all work together. “as for me,” she said, “i have fear.
 things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever may happen must
 have in it some element of hope or comfort. go, my husband! god can, if
 wishes it, guard as well alone as with any one present.” so i
 started up crying out: “then in god’s name let us come at once, for we
 are losing time. the count may come to piccadilly earlier than we
 think.”
 
“not so!” said helsing, holding up his hand.
 
“but why?” i asked.
 
“do you forget,” said, with actually smile, “that last night he
 banqueted heavily, and will sleep late?”
 
did i forget! shall i ever--can i ever! can any of us ever forget that
 terrible scene! mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but
 the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and
 shuddered whilst she moaned. helsing had not intended to recall her
 frightful experience. had simply lost sight of her and her part in
 the affair in his intellectual effort. when it struck him what said,
 was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her. “oh,
 madam mina,” said, “dear, dear madam mina, alas! that i of all who so
 reverence you should have said anything so forgetful. these stupid old
 lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so; but you will
 forget it, will you not?” bent low beside her as spoke; she took
 his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said hoarsely:--
 
“no, i shall not forget, for it is well that i remember; and with it i
 have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that i take it all
 together. now, you must all be going soon. breakfast is ready, and we
 must all eat that we may be strong.”
 
breakfast was strange meal to us all. we tried to be cheerful and
 encourage each other, and mina was the brightest and most cheerful of
 us. when it was over, helsing stood up and said:--
 
“now, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise. are we
 all armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy’s
 lair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?” we all assured
 him. “then it is well. now, madam mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe
 here until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if---- we shall
 return! but before we go let see you armed against personal attack. i
 have myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing
 of things of which we know, so that may not enter. now let guard
 yourself. on your forehead i touch this piece of sacred wafer in the
 name of the father, the son, and----”
 
there was fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. as he
 had placed the wafer on mina’s forehead, it had seared it--had burned
 into the flesh as though it had been piece of white-hot metal. my poor
 darling’s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as
 her nerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that
 her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream. but the
 words to her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased
 to ring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her
 knees on the floor in an agony of abasement. pulling her beautiful hair
 over her face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--
 
“unclean! unclean! even the almighty shuns my polluted flesh! i must
 bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the judgment day.” they
 all paused. i had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless
 grief, and putting my arms around held her tight. for few minutes our
 sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away
 their eyes that ran tears silently. then helsing turned and said
 gravely; so gravely that i could not help feeling that was in some
 way inspired, and was stating things outside himself:--
 
“it may be that you may have to bear that mark till god himself see fit,
 as most surely shall, on the judgment day, to redress all wrongs of
 the earth and of his children that has placed thereon. and oh, madam
 mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that
 red scar, the sign of god’s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away,
 and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know. for so surely as
 we live, that scar shall pass away when god sees right to lift the
 burden that is hard upon us. till then we bear our cross, as his did
 in obedience to his will. it may be that we are chosen instruments of
 his good pleasure, and that we ascend to his bidding as that other
 through stripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and
 fears, and all that makes the difference between god and man.”
 
there was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.
 mina and i both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old
 man’s hands and bent over and kissed it. then without word we all
 knelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each
 other. we men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the
 head of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help
 and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.
 
it was then time to start. so i said farewell to mina, parting which
 neither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.
 
to one thing i have made up my mind: if we find out that mina must be a
 vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible
 land alone. i suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant
 many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth, so
 the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks.
 
we entered carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on
 the first occasion. it was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic
 surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such
 fear as already we knew. had not our minds been made up, and had there
 not been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded
 with our task. we found papers, or any sign of use in the house; and
 in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.
 dr. helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--
 
“and now, my friends, we have duty here to do. we must sterilise this
 earth, so sacred of holy memories, that has brought from far
 distant land for such fell use. has chosen this earth because it has
 been holy. thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more
 holy still. it was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to
 god.” as spoke took from his bag screwdriver and wrench, and
 very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open. the earth smelled
 musty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention
 was concentrated on the professor. taking from his box piece of the
 sacred wafer laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down
 the lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as worked.
 
one by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left
 them as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was portion
 of the host.
 
when we closed the door behind us, the professor said solemnly:--
 
“so much is already done. if it may be that with all the others we can
 be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on madam
 mina’s forehead all white as ivory and with stain!”
 
as we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our
 train we could see the front of the asylum. i looked eagerly, and in the
 window of my own room saw mina. i waved my hand to her, and nodded to
 tell that our work there was successfully accomplished. she nodded in
 reply to show that she understood. the last i saw, she was waving her
 hand in farewell. it was with heavy heart that we sought the station
 and just caught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the
 platform.
 
i have written this in the train.
 
* * * * *
 
_piccadilly, 12:30 o’clock._--just before we reached fenchurch street
 lord godalming said to me:--
 
“quincey and i will find locksmith. you had better not come with us in
 case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it
 wouldn’t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house. but you are a
 solicitor and the incorporated law society might tell you that you
 should have known better.” i demurred as to my not sharing any danger
 even of odium, but went on: “besides, it will attract less attention
 if there are not too many of us. my title will make it all right with
 the locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along. you had
 better go with jack and the professor and stay in the green park,
 somewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door opened and
 the smith has gone away, do you all come across. we shall be on the
 lookout for you, and shall let you in.”
 
“the advice is good!” said helsing, so we said more. godalming
 and morris hurried off in cab, we following in another. at the corner
 of arlington street our contingent got out and strolled into the green
 park. my heart beat as i saw the house on which so much of our hope was
 centred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst
 its more lively and spruce-looking neighbours. we sat down on bench
 within good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little
 attention as possible. the minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we
 waited for the coming of the others.
 
at length we saw four-wheeler drive up. out of it, in leisurely
 fashion, got lord godalming and morris; and down from the box descended
 thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools. morris paid
 the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away. together the two
 ascended the steps, and lord godalming pointed out what wanted done.
 the workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes
 of the rail, saying something to policeman who just then sauntered
 along. the policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down
 placed his bag beside him. after searching through it, took out a
 selection of tools which produced to lay beside him in orderly
 fashion. then stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and
 turning to his employers, made some remark. lord godalming smiled, and
 the man lifted good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he
 began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. after fumbling
 about for bit tried second, and then third. all at once the
 door opened under slight push from him, and and the two others
 entered the hall. we sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but van
 helsing’s went cold altogether. we waited patiently as we saw the
 workman come out and bring in his bag. then held the door partly
 open, steadying it with his knees, whilst fitted key to the lock.
 this finally handed to lord godalming, who took out his purse and
 gave him something. the man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his
 coat and departed; not soul took the slightest notice of the whole
 transaction.
 
when the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at
 the door. it was immediately opened by quincey morris, beside whom stood
 lord godalming lighting cigar.
 
“the place smells so vilely,” said the latter as we came in. it did
 indeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at carfax--and with our
 previous experience it was plain to us that the count had been using the
 place pretty freely. we moved to explore the house, all keeping together
 in case of attack; for we knew we had strong and wily enemy to deal
 with, and as yet we did not know whether the count might not be in the
 house. in the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall, we found
 eight boxes of earth. eight boxes only out of the nine, which we sought!
 our work was not over, and would never be until we should have found the
 missing box. first we opened the shutters of the window which looked out
 across narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face of stable,
 pointed to look like the front of miniature house. there were no
 windows in it, so we were not afraid of being over-looked. we did not
 lose any time in examining the chests. with the tools which we had
 brought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had
 treated those others in the old chapel. it was evident to us that the
 count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for
 any of his effects.
 
after cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic,
 we came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects
 which might belong to the count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine
 them. they lay in sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room
 table. there were title deeds of the piccadilly house in great bundle;
 deeds of the purchase of the houses at mile end and bermondsey;
 note-paper, envelopes, and pens and ink. all were covered up in thin
 wrapping paper to keep them from the dust. there were also clothes
 brush, brush and comb, and jug and basin--the latter containing
 dirty water which was reddened as if with blood. last of all was a
 little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to
 the other houses. when we had examined this last find, lord godalming
 and quincey morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the
 houses in the east and the south, took with them the keys in great
 bunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places. the rest of us
 are, with what patience we can, waiting their return--or the coming of
 the count.
 



chapter xxiii
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_3 october._--the time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for
 the coming of godalming and quincey morris. the professor tried to keep
 our minds active by using them all the time. i could see his beneficent
 purpose, by the side glances which threw from time to time at harker.
 the poor fellow is overwhelmed in misery that is appalling to see.
 last night was frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful
 face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair. to-day is drawn,
 haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning
 eyes and grief-written lines of his face. his energy is still intact; in
 fact, is like living flame. this may yet be his salvation, for, if
 all go well, it will tide him over the despairing period; will then,
 in kind of way, wake again to the realities of life. poor fellow, i
 thought my own trouble was bad enough, but his----! the professor knows
 this well enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active. what he
 has been saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest. so
 well as i can remember, here it is:--
 
“i have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all
 the papers relating to this monster; and the more i have studied, the
 greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. all through there
 are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of
 it. as i learned from the researches of my friend arminus of buda-pesth,
 was in life most wonderful man. soldier, statesman, and
 alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the
 science-knowledge of his time. had mighty brain, learning beyond
 compare, and heart that knew fear and remorse. dared even to
 attend the scholomance, and there was branch of knowledge of his time
 that did not essay. well, in him the brain powers survived the
 physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.
 in some faculties of mind has been, and is, only child; but is
 growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of
 man’s stature. is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not
 been that we have crossed his path would be yet--he may be yet if we
 fail--the father or furtherer of new order of beings, whose road must
 lead through death, not life.”
 
harker groaned and said, “and this is all arrayed against my darling!
 but how is experimenting? the knowledge may help us to defeat him!”
 
“he has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but
 surely; that big child-brain of his is working. well for us, it is, as
 yet, child-brain; for had dared, at the first, to attempt certain
 things would long ago have been beyond our power. however, means
 to succeed, and man who has centuries before him can afford to wait
 and to go slow. _festina lente_ may well be his motto.”
 
“i fail to understand,” said harker wearily. “oh, do be more plain to
 me! perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.”
 
the professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as spoke:--
 
“ah, my child, i will be plain. do you not see how, of late, this
 monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally. how has been
 making use of the zoöphagous patient to effect his entry into friend
 john’s home; for your vampire, though in all afterwards can come when
 and how will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by
 an inmate. but these are not his most important experiments. do we not
 see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others. he
 knew not then but that must be so. but all the time that so great
 child-brain of his was growing, and began to consider whether he
 might not himself move the box. so began to help; and then, when he
 found that this be all-right, try to move them all alone. and so he
 progress, and scatter these graves of him; and none but know where
 they are hidden. may have intend to bury them deep in the ground. so
 that only use them in the night, or at such time as can change his
 form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his
 hiding-place! but, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him
 just too late! already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him;
 and before the sunset this shall be so. then have place where he
 can move and hide. i delayed this morning that so we might be sure. is
 there not more at stake for us than for him? then why we not be even
 more careful than him? by my clock it is one hour and already, if all be
 well, friend arthur and quincey are on their way to us. to-day is our
 day, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose chance. see! there are
 five of us when those absent ones return.”
 
whilst was speaking we were startled by knock at the hall door, the
 double postman’s knock of the telegraph boy. we all moved out to the
 hall with one impulse, and helsing, holding up his hand to us to
 keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it. the boy handed in a
 despatch. the professor closed the door again, and, after looking at the
 direction, opened it and read aloud.
 
“look out for d. has just now, 12:45, come from carfax hurriedly and
 hastened towards the south. seems to be going the round and may want
 to see you: mina.”
 
there was pause, broken by jonathan harker’s voice:--
 
“now, god be thanked, we shall soon meet!” helsing turned to him
 quickly and said:--
 
“god will act in his own way and time. do not fear, and do not rejoice
 as yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.”
 
“i care for nothing now,” answered hotly, “except to wipe out this
 brute from the face of creation. i would sell my soul to do it!”
 
“oh, hush, hush, my child!” said helsing. “god does not purchase
 souls in this wise; and the devil, though may purchase, does not keep
 faith. but god is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your
 devotion to that dear madam mina. think you, how her pain would be
 doubled, did she but hear your wild words. do not fear any of us, we are
 all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. the time is
 coming for action; to-day this vampire is limit to the powers of man,
 and till sunset may not change. it will take him time to arrive
 here--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times
 before can hither come, be never so quick. what we must hope for
 is that my lord arthur and quincey arrive first.”
 
about half an hour after we had received mrs. harker’s telegram, there
 came quiet, resolute knock at the hall door. it was just an ordinary
 knock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made
 the professor’s heart and mine beat loudly. we looked at each other, and
 together moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various
 armaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the mortal in the right. van
 helsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood
 back, having both hands ready for action. the gladness of our hearts
 must have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we
 saw lord godalming and quincey morris. they came quickly in and closed
 the door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the
 hall:--
 
“it is all right. we found both places; six boxes in each and we
 destroyed them all!”
 
“destroyed?” asked the professor.
 
“for him!” we were silent for minute, and then quincey said:--
 
“there’s nothing to do but to wait here. if, however, doesn’t turn up
 by five o’clock, we must start off; for it won’t do to leave mrs. harker
 alone after sunset.”
 
“he will be here before long now,” said helsing, who had been
 consulting his pocket-book. “_nota bene_, in madam’s telegram went
 south from carfax, that means went to cross the river, and could
 only do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one
 o’clock. that went south has meaning for us. is as yet only
 suspicious; and went from carfax first to the place where would
 suspect interference least. you must have been at bermondsey only a
 short time before him. that is not here already shows that went to
 mile end next. this took him some time; for would then have to be
 carried over the river in some way. believe me, my friends, we shall not
 have long to wait now. we should have ready some plan of attack, so that
 we may throw away chance. hush, there is time now. have all your
 arms! be ready!” held up warning hand as spoke, for we all could
 hear key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door.
 
i could not but admire, even at such moment, the way in which a
 dominant spirit asserted itself. in all our hunting parties and
 adventures in different parts of the world, quincey morris had always
 been the one to arrange the plan of action, and arthur and i had been
 accustomed to obey him implicitly. now, the old habit seemed to be
 renewed instinctively. with swift glance around the room, at once
 laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking word, with a
 gesture, placed us each in position. helsing, harker, and i were
 just behind the door, so that when it was opened the professor could
 guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.
 godalming behind and quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to
 move in front of the window. we waited in suspense that made the
 seconds pass with nightmare slowness. the slow, careful steps came along
 the hall; the count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least
 feared it.
 
suddenly with single bound leaped into the room, winning way past
 us before any of us could raise hand to stay him. there was something
 so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it seemed
 to sober us all from the shock of his coming. the first to act was
 harker, who, with quick movement, threw himself before the door
 leading into the room in the front of the house. as the count saw us, a
 horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth long
 and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into cold stare of
 lion-like disdain. his expression again changed as, with single
 impulse, we all advanced upon him. it was pity that we had not some
 better organised plan of attack, for even at the moment i wondered what
 we were to do. i did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would
 avail us anything. harker evidently meant to try the matter, for had
 ready his great kukri knife and made fierce and sudden cut at him. the
 blow was powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the count’s
 leap back saved him. second less and the trenchant blade had shorne
 through his heart. as it was, the point just cut the cloth of his coat,
 making wide gap whence bundle of bank-notes and stream of gold
 fell out. the expression of the count’s face was so hellish, that for a
 moment i feared for harker, though i saw him throw the terrible knife
 aloft again for another stroke. instinctively i moved forward with a
 protective impulse, holding the crucifix and wafer in my left hand. i
 felt mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that i
 saw the monster cower back before similar movement made spontaneously
 by each one of us. it would be impossible to describe the expression of
 hate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over
 the count’s face. his waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast
 of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the
 pallid skin like palpitating wound. the next instant, with sinuous
 dive swept under harker’s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping
 handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw
 himself at the window. amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass,
 tumbled into the flagged area below. through the sound of the
 shivering glass i could hear the “ting” of the gold, as some of the
 sovereigns fell on the flagging.
 
we ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground. he, rushing up
 the steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.
 there turned and spoke to us:--
 
“you think to baffle me, you--with your pale faces all in row, like
 sheep in butcher’s. you shall be sorry yet, each one of you! you think
 you have left without place to rest; but i have more. my revenge is
 just begun! i spread it over centuries, and time is on my side. your
 girls that you all love are mine already; and through them you and
 others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to be my
 jackals when i want to feed. bah!” with contemptuous sneer, passed
 quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he
 fastened it behind him. door beyond opened and shut. the first of us
 to speak was the professor, as, realising the difficulty of following
 him through the stable, we moved toward the hall.
 
“we have learnt something--much! notwithstanding his brave words, he
 fears us; fear time, fear want! for if not, why hurry so? his
 very tone betray him, or my ears deceive. why take that money? you
 follow quick. you are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so. for
 me, i make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he
 return.” as spoke put the money remaining into his pocket; took
 the title-deeds in the bundle as harker had left them, and swept the
 remaining things into the open fireplace, where set fire to them with
 match.
 
godalming and morris had rushed out into the yard, and harker had
 lowered himself from the window to follow the count. had, however,
 bolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there
 was sign of him. helsing and i tried to make inquiry at the back
 of the house; but the mews was deserted and one had seen him depart.
 
it was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off. we had to
 recognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the
 professor when said:--
 
“let us go back to madam mina--poor, poor dear madam mina. all we can do
 just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. but we need
 not despair. there is but one more earth-box, and we must try to find
 it; when that is done all may yet be well.” i could see that spoke as
 bravely as could to comfort harker. the poor fellow was quite broken
 down; now and again gave low groan which could not suppress--he
 was thinking of his wife.
 
with sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found mrs. harker
 waiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her
 bravery and unselfishness. when she saw our faces, her own became as
 pale as death: for second or two her eyes were closed as if she were
 in secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--
 
“i can never thank you all enough. oh, my poor darling!” as she spoke,
 she took her husband’s grey head in her hands and kissed it--“lay your
 poor head here and rest it. all will yet be well, dear! god will protect
 us if so will it in his good intent.” the poor fellow groaned. there
 was place for words in his sublime misery.
 
we had sort of perfunctory supper together, and i think it cheered us
 all up somewhat. it was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to hungry
 people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or the sense
 of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all less
 miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope. true to
 our promise, we told mrs. harker everything which had passed; and
 although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to
 threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was
 manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness. when we came to the
 part where harker had rushed at the count so recklessly, she clung to
 her husband’s arm, and held it tight as though her clinging could
 protect him from any harm that might come. she said nothing, however,
 till the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right up
 to the present time. then without letting go her husband’s hand she
 stood up amongst us and spoke. oh, that i could give any idea of the
 scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty
 of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which
 she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our
 teeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against
 our grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and
 we, knowing that so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and
 purity and faith, was outcast from god.
 
“jonathan,” she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips it was
 so full of love and tenderness, “jonathan dear, and you all my true,
 true friends, i want you to bear something in mind through all this
 dreadful time. i know that you must fight--that you must destroy even as
 you destroyed the false lucy so that the true lucy might live hereafter;
 but it is not work of hate. that poor soul who has wrought all this
 misery is the saddest case of all. just think what will be his joy when
 he, too, is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have
 spiritual immortality. you must be pitiful to him, too, though it may
 not hold your hands from his destruction.”
 
as she spoke i could see her husband’s face darken and draw together, as
 though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.
 instinctively the clasp on his wife’s hand grew closer, till his
 knuckles looked white. she did not flinch from the pain which i knew she
 must have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing
 than ever. as she stopped speaking leaped to his feet, almost tearing
 his hand from hers as spoke:--
 
“may god give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that
 earthly life of him which we are aiming at. if beyond it i could send
 his soul for ever and ever to burning hell i would do it!”
 
“oh, hush! oh, hush! in the name of the good god. don’t say such things,
 jonathan, my husband; or you will crush with fear and horror. just
 think, my dear--i have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that
 ... perhaps ... some day ... i, too, may need such pity; and that some
 other like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me! oh,
 my husband! my husband, indeed i would have spared you such thought
 had there been another way; but i pray that god may not have treasured
 your wild words, except as the heart-broken wail of very loving and
 sorely stricken man. oh, god, let these poor white hairs go in evidence
 of what has suffered, who all his life has done wrong, and on whom
 so many sorrows have come.”
 
we men were all in tears now. there was resisting them, and we wept
 openly. she wept, too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.
 her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms
 round her, hid his face in the folds of her dress. helsing beckoned
 to us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone
 with their god.
 
before they retired the professor fixed up the room against any coming
 of the vampire, and assured mrs. harker that she might rest in peace.
 she tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her
 husband’s sake, tried to seem content. it was brave struggle; and was,
 i think and believe, not without its reward. helsing had placed at
 hand bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.
 when they had retired, quincey, godalming, and i arranged that we should
 sit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the
 poor stricken lady. the first watch falls to quincey, so the rest of us
 shall be off to bed as soon as we can. godalming has already turned in,
 for his is the second watch. now that my work is done i, too, shall go
 to bed.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_3-4 october, close to midnight._--i thought yesterday would never end.
 there was over yearning for sleep, in some sort of blind belief
 that to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change must
 now be for the better. before we parted, we discussed what our next step
 was to be, but we could arrive at result. all we knew was that one
 earth-box remained, and that the count alone knew where it was. if he
 chooses to lie hidden, may baffle us for years; and in the
 meantime!--the thought is too horrible, i dare not think of it even now.
 this i know: that if ever there was woman who was all perfection, that
 one is my poor wronged darling. i love her thousand times more for her
 sweet pity of last night, pity that made my own hate of the monster
 seem despicable. surely god will not permit the world to be the poorer
 by the loss of such creature. this is hope to me. we are all drifting
 reefwards now, and faith is our only anchor. thank god! mina is
 sleeping, and sleeping without dreams. i fear what her dreams might be
 like, with such terrible memories to ground them in. she has not been so
 calm, within my seeing, since the sunset. then, for while, there came
 over her face repose which was like spring after the blasts of march.
 i thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her
 face, but somehow now i think it has deeper meaning. i am not sleepy
 myself, though i am weary--weary to death. however, i must try to sleep;
 for there is to-morrow to think of, and there is rest for me
 until....
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--i must have fallen asleep, for i was awaked by mina, who was
 sitting up in bed, with startled look on her face. i could see easily,
 for we did not leave the room in darkness; she had placed warning hand
 over my mouth, and now she whispered in my ear:--
 
“hush! there is someone in the corridor!” i got up softly, and crossing
 the room, gently opened the door.
 
just outside, stretched on mattress, lay mr. morris, wide awake. he
 raised warning hand for silence as whispered to me:--
 
“hush! go back to bed; it is all right. one of us will be here all
 night. we don’t mean to take any chances!”
 
his look and gesture forbade discussion, so i came back and told mina.
 she sighed and positively shadow of smile stole over her poor, pale
 face as she put her arms round and said softly:--
 
“oh, thank god for good brave men!” with sigh she sank back again to
 sleep. i write this now as i am not sleepy, though i must try again.
 
* * * * *
 
_4 october, morning._--once again during the night i was wakened by
 mina. this time we had all had good sleep, for the grey of the coming
 dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs, and the gas flame was
 like speck rather than disc of light. she said to hurriedly:--
 
“go, call the professor. i want to see him at once.”
 
“why?” i asked.
 
“i have an idea. i suppose it must have come in the night, and matured
 without my knowing it. must hypnotise before the dawn, and then i
 shall be able to speak. go quick, dearest; the time is getting close.” i
 went to the door. dr. seward was resting on the mattress, and, seeing
 me, sprang to his feet.
 
“is anything wrong?” asked, in alarm.
 
“no,” i replied; “but mina wants to see dr. helsing at once.”
 
“i will go,” said, and hurried into the professor’s room.
 
in two or three minutes later helsing was in the room in his
 dressing-gown, and mr. morris and lord godalming were with dr. seward at
 the door asking questions. when the professor saw mina smile--a
 positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; rubbed his hands as he
 said:--
 
“oh, my dear madam mina, this is indeed change. see! friend jonathan,
 we have got our dear madam mina, as of old, back to us to-day!” then
 turning to her, said, cheerfully: “and what am i do for you? for at
 this hour you do not want for nothings.”
 
“i want you to hypnotise me!” she said. “do it before the dawn, for i
 feel that then i can speak, and speak freely. be quick, for the time is
 short!” without word motioned her to sit up in bed.
 
looking fixedly at her, commenced to make passes in front of her,
 from over the top of her head downward, with each hand in turn. mina
 gazed at him fixedly for few minutes, during which my own heart beat
 like trip hammer, for i felt that some crisis was at hand. gradually
 her eyes closed, and she sat, stock still; only by the gentle heaving of
 her bosom could one know that she was alive. the professor made few
 more passes and then stopped, and i could see that his forehead was
 covered with great beads of perspiration. mina opened her eyes; but she
 did not seem the same woman. there was far-away look in her eyes, and
 her voice had sad dreaminess which was new to me. raising his hand to
 impose silence, the professor motioned to to bring the others in.
 they came on tip-toe, closing the door behind them, and stood at the
 foot of the bed, looking on. mina appeared not to see them. the
 stillness was broken by helsing’s voice speaking in low level tone
 which would not break the current of her thoughts:--
 
“where are you?” the answer came in neutral way:--
 
“i do not know. sleep has place it can call its own.” for several
 minutes there was silence. mina sat rigid, and the professor stood
 staring at her fixedly; the rest of us hardly dared to breathe. the room
 was growing lighter; without taking his eyes from mina’s face, dr. van
 helsing motioned to pull up the blind. i did so, and the day seemed
 just upon us. red streak shot up, and rosy light seemed to diffuse
 itself through the room. on the instant the professor spoke again:--
 
“where are you now?” the answer came dreamily, but with intention; it
 were as though she were interpreting something. i have heard her use the
 same tone when reading her shorthand notes.
 
“i do not know. it is all strange to me!”
 
“what do you see?”
 
“i can see nothing; it is all dark.”
 
“what do you hear?” i could detect the strain in the professor’s patient
 voice.
 
“the lapping of water. it is gurgling by, and little waves leap. i can
 hear them on the outside.”
 
“then you are on ship?” we all looked at each other, trying to glean
 something each from the other. we were afraid to think. the answer came
 quick:--
 
“oh, yes!”
 
“what else do you hear?”
 
“the sound of men stamping overhead as they run about. there is the
 creaking of chain, and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan
 falls into the rachet.”
 
“what are you doing?”
 
“i am still--oh, so still. it is like death!” the voice faded away into
 deep breath as of one sleeping, and the open eyes closed again.
 
by this time the sun had risen, and we were all in the full light of
 day. dr. helsing placed his hands on mina’s shoulders, and laid her
 head down softly on her pillow. she lay like sleeping child for few
 moments, and then, with long sigh, awoke and stared in wonder to see
 us all around her. “have i been talking in my sleep?” was all she said.
 she seemed, however, to know the situation without telling, though she
 was eager to know what she had told. the professor repeated the
 conversation, and she said:--
 
“then there is not moment to lose: it may not be yet too late!” mr.
 morris and lord godalming started for the door but the professor’s calm
 voice called them back:--
 
“stay, my friends. that ship, wherever it was, was weighing anchor
 whilst she spoke. there are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in
 your so great port of london. which of them is it that you seek? god be
 thanked that we have once again clue, though whither it may lead us we
 know not. we have been blind somewhat; blind after the manner of men,
 since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking
 forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen! alas, but
 that sentence is puddle; is it not? we can know now what was in the
 count’s mind, when seize that money, though jonathan’s so fierce
 knife put him in the danger that even dread. meant escape. hear
 me, escape! saw that with but one earth-box left, and pack of men
 following like dogs after fox, this london was place for him. he
 have take his last earth-box on board ship, and leave the land. he
 think to escape, but no! we follow him. tally ho! as friend arthur would
 say when put on his red frock! our old fox is wily; oh! so wily, and
 we must follow with wile. i, too, am wily and i think his mind in a
 little while. in meantime we may rest and in peace, for there are waters
 between us which do not want to pass, and which could not if he
 would--unless the ship were to touch the land, and then only at full or
 slack tide. see, and the sun is just rose, and all day to sunset is to
 us. let us take bath, and dress, and have breakfast which we all need,
 and which we can eat comfortably since be not in the same land with
 us.” mina looked at him appealingly as she asked:--
 
“but why need we seek him further, when is gone away from us?” he
 took her hand and patted it as replied:--
 
“ask nothings as yet. when we have breakfast, then i answer all
 questions.” would say more, and we separated to dress.
 
after breakfast mina repeated her question. looked at her gravely for
 minute and then said sorrowfully:--
 
“because my dear, dear madam mina, now more than ever must we find him
 even if we have to follow him to the jaws of hell!” she grew paler as
 she asked faintly:--
 
“why?”
 
“because,” answered solemnly, “he can live for centuries, and you are
 but mortal woman. time is now to be dreaded--since once put that mark
 upon your throat.”
 
i was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in faint.
 



chapter xxiv
 
dr. seward’s phonograph diary, spoken by helsing
 

this to jonathan harker.
 
you are to stay with your dear madam mina. we shall go to make our
 search--if i can call it so, for it is not search but knowing, and we
 seek confirmation only. but do you stay and take care of her to-day.
 this is your best and most holiest office. this day nothing can find him
 here. let tell you that so you will know what we four know already,
 for i have tell them. he, our enemy, have gone away; have gone back
 to his castle in transylvania. i know it so well, as if great hand of
 fire wrote it on the wall. have prepare for this in some way, and
 that last earth-box was ready to ship somewheres. for this took the
 money; for this hurry at the last, lest we catch him before the sun
 go down. it was his last hope, save that might hide in the tomb that
 think poor miss lucy, being as thought like him, keep open to him.
 but there was not of time. when that fail make straight for his last
 resource--his last earth-work i might say did i wish _double entente_.
 is clever, oh, so clever! know that his game here was finish; and
 so decide go back home. find ship going by the route came,
 and go in it. we go off now to find what ship, and whither bound;
 when we have discover that, we come back and tell you all. then we will
 comfort you and poor dear madam mina with new hope. for it will be hope
 when you think it over: that all is not lost. this very creature that we
 pursue, take hundreds of years to get so far as london; and yet in
 one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. is
 finite, though is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do.
 but we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong
 together. take heart afresh, dear husband of madam mina. this battle is
 but begun, and in the end we shall win--so sure as that god sits on high
 to watch over his children. therefore be of much comfort till we return.
 
helsing.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_4 october._--when i read to mina, helsing’s message in the
 phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. already the
 certainty that the count is out of the country has given her comfort;
 and comfort is strength to her. for my own part, now that his horrible
 danger is not face to face with us, it seems almost impossible to
 believe in it. even my own terrible experiences in castle dracula seem
 like long-forgotten dream. here in the crisp autumn air in the bright
 sunlight----
 
alas! how can i disbelieve! in the midst of my thought my eye fell on
 the red scar on my poor darling’s white forehead. whilst that lasts,
 there can be disbelief. and afterwards the very memory of it will
 keep faith crystal clear. mina and i fear to be idle, so we have been
 over all the diaries again and again. somehow, although the reality
 seems greater each time, the pain and the fear seem less. there is
 something of guiding purpose manifest throughout, which is comforting.
 mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good. it may
 be! i shall try to think as she does. we have never spoken to each other
 yet of the future. it is better to wait till we see the professor and
 the others after their investigations.
 
the day is running by more quickly than i ever thought day could run
 for again. it is now three o’clock.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_5 october, 5 p. m._--our meeting for report. present: professor van
 helsing, lord godalming, dr. seward, mr. quincey morris, jonathan
 harker, mina harker.
 
dr. helsing described what steps were taken during the day to
 discover on what boat and whither bound count dracula made his escape:--
 
“as i knew that wanted to get back to transylvania, i felt sure that
 must go by the danube mouth; or by somewhere in the black sea, since
 by that way come. it was dreary blank that was before us. _omne
 ignotum pro magnifico_; and so with heavy hearts we start to find what
 ships leave for the black last night. was in sailing ship, since
 madam mina tell of sails being set. these not so important as to go in
 your list of the shipping in the _times_, and so we go, by suggestion of
 lord godalming, to your lloyd’s, where are note of all ships that sail,
 however so small. there we find that only one black-sea-bound ship go
 out with the tide. she is the _czarina catherine_, and she sail from
 doolittle’s wharf for varna, and thence on to other parts and up the
 danube. ‘soh!’ said i, ‘this is the ship whereon is the count.’ so off
 we go to doolittle’s wharf, and there we find man in an office of wood
 so small that the man look bigger than the office. from him we inquire
 of the goings of the _czarina catherine_. swear much, and red face
 and loud of voice, but good fellow all the same; and when quincey
 give him something from his pocket which crackle as roll it up, and
 put it in so small bag which have hid deep in his clothing, he
 still better fellow and humble servant to us. come with us, and ask
 many men who are rough and hot; these be better fellows too when they
 have been more thirsty. they say much of blood and bloom, and of
 others which i comprehend not, though i guess what they mean; but
 nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know.
 
“they make known to us among them, how last afternoon at about five
 o’clock comes man so hurry. tall man, thin and pale, with high nose
 and teeth so white, and eyes that seem to be burning. that be all in
 black, except that have hat of straw which suit not him or the
 time. that scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship
 sails for the black and for where. some took him to the office and
 then to the ship, where will not go aboard but halt at shore end of
 gang-plank, and ask that the captain come to him. the captain come, when
 told that will be pay well; and though swear much at the first he
 agree to term. then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse
 and cart can be hired. go there and soon come again, himself
 driving cart on which great box; this himself lift down, though it
 take several to put it on truck for the ship. give much talk to
 captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but the captain like
 it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him that if like he
 can come and see where it shall be. but say ‘no’; that come not
 yet, for that have much to do. whereupon the captain tell him that he
 had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will leave the
 place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood. then the thin
 man smile and say that of course must go when think fit; but he
 will be surprise if go quite so soon. the captain swear again,
 polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say that he
 will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the
 sailing. final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell
 him that doesn’t want frenchmen--with bloom upon them and also
 with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also. and so, after asking
 where there might be close at hand ship where might purchase ship
 forms, departed.
 
“no one knew where went ‘or bloomin’ well cared,’ as they said, for
 they had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon
 became apparent to all that the _czarina catherine_ would not sail as
 was expected. thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it grew,
 and grew; till soon dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her.
 the captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and
 blood; but could do nothing. the water rose and rose; and began to
 fear that would lose the tide altogether. was in friendly mood,
 when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank again and
 asked to see where his box had been stowed. then the captain replied
 that wished that and his box--old and with much bloom and
 blood--were in hell. but the thin man did not be offend, and went down
 with the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile
 on deck in fog. must have come off by himself, for none notice him.
 indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away, and
 all was clear again. my friends of the thirst and the language that was
 of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain’s swears
 exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of
 picturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up
 and down on the river that hour, found that few of them had seen any
 of fog at all, except where it lay round the wharf. however, the ship
 went out on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the
 river mouth. she was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.
 
“and so, my dear madam mina, it is that we have to rest for time, for
 our enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the
 danube mouth. to sail ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when
 we start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there. our best hope
 is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then
 can make struggle, and we may deal with him as we should. there
 are days for us, in which we can make ready our plan. we know all about
 where go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us
 invoices and all papers that can be. the box we seek is to be landed in
 varna, and to be given to an agent, one ristics who will there present
 his credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.
 when ask if there be any wrong, for that so, can telegraph and
 have inquiry made at varna, we say ‘no’; for what is to be done is not
 for police or of the customs. it must be done by us alone and in our own
 way.”
 
when dr. helsing had done speaking, i asked him if were certain
 that the count had remained on board the ship. replied: “we have the
 best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance this
 morning.” i asked him again if it were really necessary that they should
 pursue the count, for oh! i dread jonathan leaving me, and i know that
 would surely go if the others went. answered in growing passion,
 at first quietly. as went on, however, grew more angry and more
 forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some
 of that personal dominance which made him so long master amongst
 men:--
 
“yes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary! for your sake in the first,
 and then for the sake of humanity. this monster has done much harm
 already, in the narrow scope where find himself, and in the short
 time when as yet was only as body groping his so small measure in
 darkness and not knowing. all this have i told these others; you, my
 dear madam mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend john, or
 in that of your husband. i have told them how the measure of leaving his
 own barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to new land where life
 of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the
 work of centuries. were another of the un-dead, like him, to try to do
 what has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have
 been, or that will be, could aid him. with this one, all the forces of
 nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in
 some wondrous way. the very place, where have been alive, un-dead for
 all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical
 world. there are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.
 there have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters
 of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. doubtless,
 there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of
 occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in
 himself were from the first some great qualities. in hard and warlike
 time was celebrate that have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,
 more braver heart, than any man. in him some vital principle have in
 strange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and
 thrive, so his brain grow too. all this without that diabolic aid which
 is surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from,
 and are, symbolic of good. and now this is what is to us. have
 infect you--oh, forgive me, my dear, that i must say such; but it is for
 good of you that i speak. infect you in such wise, that even if do
 more, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and
 so in time, death, which is of man’s common lot and with god’s sanction,
 shall make you like to him. this must not be! we have sworn together
 that it must not. thus are we ministers of god’s own wish: that the
 world, and men for whom his die, will not be given over to monsters,
 whose very existence would defame him. have allowed us to redeem one
 soul already, and we go out as the old knights of the cross to redeem
 more. like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if
 we fall, we fall in good cause.” paused and i said:--
 
“but will not the count take his rebuff wisely? since has been driven
 from england, will not avoid it, as tiger does the village from
 which has been hunted?”
 
“aha!” said, “your simile of the tiger good, for me, and i shall
 adopt him. your man-eater, as they of india call the tiger who has once
 tasted blood of the human, care more for the other prey, but prowl
 unceasing till get him. this that we hunt from our village is a
 tiger, too, man-eater, and never cease to prowl. nay, in himself he
 is not one to retire and stay afar. in his life, his living life, go
 over the turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; be
 beaten back, but did stay? no! come again, and again, and again.
 look at his persistence and endurance. with the child-brain that was to
 him have long since conceive the idea of coming to great city. what
 does do? find out the place of all the world most of promise for
 him. then deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task. he
 find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers. he
 study new tongues. learn new social life; new environment of old
 ways, the politic, the law, the finance, the science, the habit of new
 land and new people who have come to be since was. his glimpse that
 have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire. nay, it help
 him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right was at
 the first in his surmises. have done this alone; all alone! from a
 ruin tomb in forgotten land. what more may not do when the greater
 world of thought is open to him. that can smile at death, as we know
 him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole
 peoples. oh, if such an one was to come from god, and not the devil,
 what force for good might not be in this old world of ours. but we
 are pledged to set the world free. our toil must be in silence, and our
 efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not
 even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his greatest
 strength. it would be at once his sheath and his armour, and his weapons
 to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even our own souls
 for the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind, and for the
 honour and glory of god.”
 
after general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing
 be definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to
 think out the proper conclusions. to-morrow, at breakfast, we are to
 meet again, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we
 shall decide on some definite cause of action.
 
* * * * *
 
i feel wonderful peace and rest to-night. it is as if some haunting
 presence were removed from me. perhaps ...
 
my surmise was not finished, could not be; for i caught sight in the
 mirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and i knew that i was still
 unclean.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_5 october._--we all rose early, and i think that sleep did much for
 each and all of us. when we met at early breakfast there was more
 general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience
 again.
 
it is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature. let
 any obstructing cause, matter what, be removed in any way--even by
 death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment. more
 than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder whether
 the whole of the past days had not been dream. it was only when i
 caught sight of the red blotch on mrs. harker’s forehead that i was
 brought back to reality. even now, when i am gravely revolving the
 matter, it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our
 trouble is still existent. even mrs. harker seems to lose sight of her
 trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something
 recalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar. we are to
 meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of
 action. i see only one immediate difficulty, i know it by instinct
 rather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet i fear
 that in some mysterious way poor mrs. harker’s tongue is tied. i _know_
 that she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been i can
 guess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or
 cannot, give them utterance. i have mentioned this to helsing, and
 and i are to talk it over when we are alone. i suppose it is some of
 that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work. the
 count had his own purposes when gave her what helsing called “the
 vampire’s baptism of blood.” well, there may be poison that distils
 itself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is
 mystery we should not wonder at anything! one thing i know: that if my
 instinct be true regarding poor mrs. harker’s silences, then there is a
 terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in the work before us. the same
 power that compels her silence may compel her speech. i dare not think
 further; for so i should in my thoughts dishonour noble woman!
 
helsing is coming to my study little before the others. i shall
 try to open the subject with him.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--when the professor came in, we talked over the state of
 things. i could see that had something on his mind which wanted to
 say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. after beating
 about the bush little, said suddenly:--
 
“friend john, there is something that you and i must talk of alone, just
 at the first at any rate. later, we may have to take the others into our
 confidence”; then stopped, so i waited; went on:--
 
“madam mina, our poor, dear madam mina is changing.” cold shiver ran
 through to find my worst fears thus endorsed. helsing
 continued:--
 
“with the sad experience of miss lucy, we must this time be warned
 before things go too far. our task is now in reality more difficult than
 ever, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance. i
 can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face. it is now
 but very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice
 without to prejudge. her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes
 are more hard. but these are not all, there is to her the silence now
 often; as so it was with miss lucy. she did not speak, even when she
 wrote that which she wished to be known later. now my fear is this. if
 it be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the count see and
 hear, is it not more true that who have hypnotise her first, and who
 have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he
 will, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?” i nodded
 acquiescence; went on:--
 
“then, what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of
 our intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not. this is painful
 task! oh, so painful that it heart-break to think of; but it must be.
 when to-day we meet, i must tell her that for reason which we will not
 to speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by
 us.” wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration
 at the thought of the pain which might have to inflict upon the poor
 soul already so tortured. i knew that it would be some sort of comfort
 to him if i told him that i also had come to the same conclusion; for at
 any rate it would take away the pain of doubt. i told him, and the
 effect was as i expected.
 
it is now close to the time of our general gathering. helsing has
 gone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it. i
 really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--at the very outset of our meeting great personal relief was
 experienced by both helsing and myself. mrs. harker had sent a
 message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as
 she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements
 without her presence to embarrass us. the professor and i looked at each
 other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved. for my own
 part, i thought that if mrs. harker realised the danger herself, it was
 much pain as well as much danger averted. under the circumstances we
 agreed, by questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to
 preserve silence in our suspicions, until we should have been able to
 confer alone again. we went at once into our plan of campaign. van
 helsing roughly put the facts before us first:--
 
“the _czarina catherine_ left the thames yesterday morning. it will take
 her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to
 reach varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three days.
 now, if we allow for two days less for the ship’s voyage, owing to such
 weather influences as we know that the count can bring to bear; and if
 we allow whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us,
 then we have margin of nearly two weeks. thus, in order to be quite
 safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest. then we shall at any rate
 be in varna day before the ship arrives, and able to make such
 preparations as may be necessary. of course we shall all go armed--armed
 against evil things, spiritual as well as physical.” here quincey morris
 added:--
 
“i understand that the count comes from wolf country, and it may be
 that shall get there before us. i propose that we add winchesters to
 our armament. i have kind of belief in winchester when there is any
 trouble of that sort around. do you remember, art, when we had the pack
 after us at tobolsk? what wouldn’t we have given then for repeater
 apiece!”
 
“good!” said helsing, “winchesters it shall be. quincey’s head is
 level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, metaphor be more
 dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man. in the meantime we
 can do nothing here; and as i think that varna is not familiar to any of
 us, why not go there more soon? it is as long to wait here as there.
 to-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all be well, we
 four can set out on our journey.”
 
“we four?” said harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of
 us.
 
“of course!” answered the professor quickly, “you must remain to take
 care of your so sweet wife!” harker was silent for awhile and then said
 in hollow voice:--
 
“let us talk of that part of it in the morning. i want to consult with
 mina.” i thought that now was the time for helsing to warn him not
 to disclose our plans to her; but took notice. i looked at him
 significantly and coughed. for answer put his finger on his lips and
 turned away.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_5 october, afternoon._--for some time after our meeting this morning i
 could not think. the new phases of things leave my mind in state of
 wonder which allows room for active thought. mina’s determination not
 to take any part in the discussion set thinking; and as i could not
 argue the matter with her, i could only guess. i am as far as ever from
 solution now. the way the others received it, too, puzzled me; the
 last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no
 more concealment of anything amongst us. mina is sleeping now, calmly
 and sweetly like little child. her lips are curved and her face beams
 with happiness. thank god, there are such moments still for her.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--how strange it all is. i sat watching mina’s happy sleep, and
 came as near to being happy myself as i suppose i shall ever be. as the
 evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking
 lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. all at
 once mina opened her eyes, and looking at tenderly, said:--
 
“jonathan, i want you to promise something on your word of honour. a
 promise made to me, but made holily in god’s hearing, and not to be
 broken though i should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter
 tears. quick, you must make it to at once.”
 
“mina,” i said, “a promise like that, i cannot make at once. i may have
 right to make it.”
 
“but, dear one,” she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes
 were like pole stars, “it is i who wish it; and it is not for myself.
 you can ask dr. helsing if i am not right; if disagrees you may
 do as you will. nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved
 from the promise.”
 
“i promise!” i said, and for moment she looked supremely happy; though
 to all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.
 she said:--
 
“promise that you will not tell anything of the plans formed for
 the campaign against the count. not by word, or inference, or
 implication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!” and she
 solemnly pointed to the scar. i saw that she was in earnest, and said
 solemnly:--
 
“i promise!” and as i said it i felt that from that instant door had
 been shut between us.
 
* * * * *
 
_later, midnight._--mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.
 so much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected
 somewhat with her gaiety; as result even i myself felt as if the pall
 of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. we all retired
 early. mina is now sleeping like little child; it is wonderful thing
 that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible
 trouble. thank god for it, for then at least she can forget her care.
 perhaps her example may affect as her gaiety did to-night. i shall
 try it. oh! for dreamless sleep.
 
* * * * *
 
_6 october, morning._--another surprise. mina woke early, about the
 same time as yesterday, and asked to bring dr. helsing. i thought
 that it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went
 for the professor. had evidently expected some such call, for i found
 him dressed in his room. his door was ajar, so that could hear the
 opening of the door of our room. came at once; as passed into the
 room, asked mina if the others might come, too.
 
“no,” she said quite simply, “it will not be necessary. you can tell
 them just as well. i must go with you on your journey.”
 
dr. helsing was as startled as i was. after moment’s pause he
 asked:--
 
“but why?”
 
“you must take with you. i am safer with you, and you shall be safer,
 too.”
 
“but why, dear madam mina? you know that your safety is our solemnest
 duty. we go into danger, to which you are, or may be, more liable than
 any of us from--from circumstances--things that have been.” paused,
 embarrassed.
 
as she replied, she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead:--
 
“i know. that is why i must go. i can tell you now, whilst the sun is
 coming up; i may not be able again. i know that when the count wills me
 i must go. i know that if tells to come in secret, i must come by
 wile; by any device to hoodwink--even jonathan.” god saw the look that
 she turned on as she spoke, and if there be indeed recording angel
 that look is noted to her everlasting honour. i could only clasp her
 hand. i could not speak; my emotion was too great for even the relief of
 tears. she went on:--
 
“you men are brave and strong. you are strong in your numbers, for you
 can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had
 to guard alone. besides, i may be of service, since you can hypnotise me
 and so learn that which even i myself do not know.” dr. helsing said
 very gravely:--
 
“madam mina, you are, as always, most wise. you shall with us come; and
 together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve.” when had
 spoken, mina’s long spell of silence made look at her. she had fallen
 back on her pillow asleep; she did not even wake when i had pulled up
 the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room. helsing
 motioned to to come with him quietly. we went to his room, and within
 minute lord godalming, dr. seward, and mr. morris were with us also.
 told them what mina had said, and went on:--
 
“in the morning we shall leave for varna. we have now to deal with a
 new factor: madam mina. oh, but her soul is true. it is to her an agony
 to tell us so much as she has done; but it is most right, and we are
 warned in time. there must be chance lost, and in varna we must be
 ready to act the instant when that ship arrives.”
 
“what shall we do exactly?” asked mr. morris laconically. the professor
 paused before replying:--
 
“we shall at the first board that ship; then, when we have identified
 the box, we shall place branch of the wild rose on it. this we shall
 fasten, for when it is there none can emerge; so at least says the
 superstition. and to superstition must we trust at the first; it was
 man’s faith in the early, and it have its root in faith still. then,
 when we get the opportunity that we seek, when none are near to see, we
 shall open the box, and--and all will be well.”
 
“i shall not wait for any opportunity,” said morris. “when i see the box
 i shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were thousand
 men looking on, and if i am to be wiped out for it the next moment!” i
 grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as piece of steel.
 i think understood my look; i hope did.
 
“good boy,” said dr. helsing. “brave boy. quincey is all man. god
 bless him for it. my child, believe none of us shall lag behind or
 pause from any fear. i do but say what we may do--what we must do. but,
 indeed, indeed we cannot say what we shall do. there are so many things
 which may happen, and their ways and their ends are so various that
 until the moment we may not say. we shall all be armed, in all ways; and
 when the time for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. now
 let us to-day put all our affairs in order. let all things which touch
 on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us
 can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. as for me, my own
 affairs are regulate; and as i have nothing else to do, i shall go make
 arrangements for the travel. i shall have all tickets and so forth for
 our journey.”
 
there was nothing further to be said, and we parted. i shall now settle
 up all my affairs of earth, and be ready for whatever may come....
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--it is all done; my will is made, and all complete. mina if she
 survive is my sole heir. if it should not be so, then the others who
 have been so good to us shall have remainder.
 
it is now drawing towards the sunset; mina’s uneasiness calls my
 attention to it. i am sure that there is something on her mind which the
 time of exact sunset will reveal. these occasions are becoming harrowing
 times for us all, for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new
 danger--some new pain, which, however, may in god’s will be means to a
 good end. i write all these things in the diary since my darling must
 not hear them now; but if it may be that she can see them again, they
 shall be ready.
 
she is calling to me.
 



chapter xxv
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_11 october, evening._--jonathan harker has asked to note this, as he
 says is hardly equal to the task, and wants an exact record kept.
 
i think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see mrs.
 harker little before the time of sunset. we have of late come to
 understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom;
 when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing
 or restraining her, or inciting her to action. this mood or condition
 begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts
 till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with
 the rays streaming above the horizon. at first there is sort of
 negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute
 freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the
 change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by spell of
 warning silence.
 
to-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the
 signs of an internal struggle. i put it down myself to her making a
 violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so. very few
 minutes, however, gave her complete control of herself; then, motioning
 her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining,
 she made the rest of us bring chairs up close. taking her husband’s hand
 in hers began:--
 
“we are all here together in freedom, for perhaps the last time! i know,
 dear; i know that you will always be with to the end.” this was to
 her husband whose hand had, as we could see, tightened upon hers. “in
 the morning we go out upon our task, and god alone knows what may be in
 store for any of us. you are going to be so good to as to take me
 with you. i know that all that brave earnest men can do for poor weak
 woman, whose soul perhaps is lost--no, no, not yet, but is at any rate
 at stake--you will do. but you must remember that i am not as you are.
 there is poison in my blood, in my soul, which may destroy me; which
 must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us. oh, my friends, you
 know as well as i do, that my soul is at stake; and though i know there
 is one way out for me, you must not and i must not take it!” she looked
 appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her husband.
 
“what is that way?” asked helsing in hoarse voice. “what is that
 way, which we must not--may not--take?”
 
“that i may die now, either by my own hand or that of another, before
 the greater evil is entirely wrought. i know, and you know, that were i
 once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit, even as you
 did my poor lucy’s. were death, or the fear of death, the only thing
 that stood in the way i would not shrink to die here, now, amidst the
 friends who love me. but death is not all. i cannot believe that to die
 in such case, when there is hope before us and bitter task to be
 done, is god’s will. therefore, i, on my part, give up here the
 certainty of eternal rest, and go out into the dark where may be the
 blackest things that the world or the nether world holds!” we were all
 silent, for we knew instinctively that this was only prelude. the
 faces of the others were set and harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps he
 guessed better than any of us what was coming. she continued:--
 
“this is what i can give into the hotch-pot.” i could not but note the
 quaint legal phrase which she used in such place, and with all
 seriousness. “what will each of you give? your lives i know,” she went
 on quickly, “that is easy for brave men. your lives are god’s, and you
 can give them back to him; but what will you give to me?” she looked
 again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband’s face. quincey
 seemed to understand; nodded, and her face lit up. “then i shall tell
 you plainly what i want, for there must be doubtful matter in this
 connection between us now. you must promise me, one and all--even you,
 my beloved husband--that, should the time come, you will kill me.”
 
“what is that time?” the voice was quincey’s, but it was low and
 strained.
 
“when you shall be convinced that i am so changed that it is better that
 i die than i may live. when i am thus dead in the flesh, then you will,
 without moment’s delay, drive stake through and cut off my head;
 or do whatever else may be wanting to give rest!”
 
quincey was the first to rise after the pause. knelt down before her
 and taking her hand in his said solemnly:--
 
“i’m only rough fellow, who hasn’t, perhaps, lived as man should to
 win such distinction, but i swear to you by all that i hold sacred and
 dear that, should the time ever come, i shall not flinch from the duty
 that you have set us. and i promise you, too, that i shall make all
 certain, for if i am only doubtful i shall take it that the time has
 come!”
 
“my true friend!” was all she could say amid her fast-falling tears, as,
 bending over, she kissed his hand.
 
“i swear the same, my dear madam mina!” said helsing.
 
“and i!” said lord godalming, each of them in turn kneeling to her to
 take the oath. i followed, myself. then her husband turned to her
 wan-eyed and with greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of
 his hair, and asked:--
 
“and must i, too, make such promise, oh, my wife?”
 
“you too, my dearest,” she said, with infinite yearning of pity in her
 voice and eyes. “you must not shrink. you are nearest and dearest and
 all the world to me; our souls are knit into one, for all life and all
 time. think, dear, that there have been times when brave men have killed
 their wives and their womenkind, to keep them from falling into the
 hands of the enemy. their hands did not falter any the more because
 those that they loved implored them to slay them. it is men’s duty
 towards those whom they love, in such times of sore trial! and oh, my
 dear, if it is to be that i must meet death at any hand, let it be at
 the hand of him that loves best. dr. helsing, i have not
 forgotten your mercy in poor lucy’s case to him who loved”--she stopped
 with flying blush, and changed her phrase--“to him who had best right
 to give her peace. if that time shall come again, i look to you to make
 it happy memory of my husband’s life that it was his loving hand which
 set free from the awful thrall upon me.”
 
“again i swear!” came the professor’s resonant voice. mrs. harker
 smiled, positively smiled, as with sigh of relief she leaned back and
 said:--
 
“and now one word of warning, warning which you must never forget:
 this time, if it ever come, may come quickly and unexpectedly, and in
 such case you must lose time in using your opportunity. at such a
 time i myself might be--nay! if the time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued
 with your enemy against you.”
 
“one more request;” she became very solemn as she said this, “it is not
 vital and necessary like the other, but i want you to do one thing for
 me, if you will.” we all acquiesced, but one spoke; there was need
 to speak:--
 
“i want you to read the burial service.” she was interrupted by deep
 groan from her husband; taking his hand in hers, she held it over her
 heart, and continued: “you must read it over some day. whatever may
 be the issue of all this fearful state of things, it will be sweet
 thought to all or some of us. you, my dearest, will i hope read it, for
 then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever--come what may!”
 
“but oh, my dear one,” pleaded, “death is afar off from you.”
 
“nay,” she said, holding up warning hand. “i am deeper in death at
 this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me!”
 
“oh, my wife, must i read it?” said, before began.
 
“it would comfort me, my husband!” was all she said; and began to
 read when she had got the book ready.
 
“how can i--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its
 solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its
 sweetness. even sceptic, who can see nothing but travesty of bitter
 truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart
 had seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling
 round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of
 her husband’s voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he
 had to pause, read the simple and beautiful service from the burial
 of the dead. i--i cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!”
 
* * * * *
 
she was right in her instinct. strange as it all was, bizarre as it may
 hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time, it
 comforted us much; and the silence, which showed mrs. harker’s coming
 relapse from her freedom of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any
 of us as we had dreaded.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_15 october, varna._--we left charing cross on the morning of the 12th,
 got to paris the same night, and took the places secured for us in the
 orient express. we travelled night and day, arriving here at about five
 o’clock. lord godalming went to the consulate to see if any telegram had
 arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--“the
 odessus.” the journey may have had incidents; i was, however, too eager
 to get on, to care for them. until the _czarina catherine_ comes into
 port there will be interest for in anything in the wide world.
 thank god! mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is
 coming back. she sleeps great deal; throughout the journey she slept
 nearly all the time. before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very
 wakeful and alert; and it has become habit for helsing to
 hypnotise her at such times. at first, some effort was needed, and he
 had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by
 habit, and scarcely any action is needed. seems to have power at
 these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. he
 always asks her what she can see and hear. she answers to the first:--
 
“nothing; all is dark.” and to the second:--
 
“i can hear the waves lapping against the ship, and the water rushing
 by. canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak. the wind is
 high--i can hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam.”
 it is evident that the _czarina catherine_ is still at sea, hastening on
 her way to varna. lord godalming has just returned. had four
 telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect:
 that the _czarina catherine_ had not been reported to lloyd’s from
 anywhere. had arranged before leaving london that his agent should
 send him every day telegram saying if the ship had been reported. he
 was to have message even if she were not reported, so that might be
 sure that there was watch being kept at the other end of the wire.
 
we had dinner and went to bed early. to-morrow we are to see the
 vice-consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship
 as soon as she arrives. helsing says that our chance will be to get
 on the boat between sunrise and sunset. the count, even if takes the
 form of bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and
 so cannot leave the ship. as dare not change to man’s form without
 suspicion--which evidently wishes to avoid--he must remain in the
 box. if, then, we can come on board after sunrise, is at our mercy;
 for we can open the box and make sure of him, as we did of poor lucy,
 before wakes. what mercy shall get from us will not count for
 much. we think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the
 seamen. thank god! this is the country where bribery can do anything,
 and we are well supplied with money. we have only to make sure that the
 ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being
 warned, and we shall be safe. judge moneybag will settle this case, i
 think!
 
* * * * *
 
_16 october._--mina’s report still the same: lapping waves and rushing
 water, darkness and favouring winds. we are evidently in good time, and
 when we hear of the _czarina catherine_ we shall be ready. as she must
 pass the dardanelles we are sure to have some report.
 
* * * * *
 
_17 october._--everything is pretty well fixed now, i think, to welcome
 the count on his return from his tour. godalming told the shippers that
 fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from
 friend of his, and got half consent that might open it at his own
 risk. the owner gave him paper telling the captain to give him every
 facility in doing whatever chose on board the ship, and also a
 similar authorisation to his agent at varna. we have seen the agent, who
 was much impressed with godalming’s kindly manner to him, and we are all
 satisfied that whatever can do to aid our wishes will be done. we
 have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. if the
 count is there, helsing and seward will cut off his head at once and
 drive stake through his heart. morris and godalming and i shall
 prevent interference, even if we have to use the arms which we shall
 have ready. the professor says that if we can so treat the count’s body,
 it will soon after fall into dust. in such case there would be no
 evidence against us, in case any suspicion of murder were aroused. but
 even if it were not, we should stand or fall by our act, and perhaps
 some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and
 rope. for myself, i should take the chance only too thankfully if it
 were to come. we mean to leave stone unturned to carry out our
 intent. we have arranged with certain officials that the instant the
 _czarina catherine_ is seen, we are to be informed by special
 messenger.
 
* * * * *
 
_24 october._--a whole week of waiting. daily telegrams to godalming,
 but only the same story: “not yet reported.” mina’s morning and evening
 hypnotic answer is unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking
 masts.
 
_telegram, october 24th._
 
_rufus smith, lloyd’s, london, to lord godalming, care of h. b. m.
 vice-consul, varna._
 
“_czarina catherine_ reported this morning from dardanelles.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_25 october._--how i miss my phonograph! to write diary with pen is
 irksome to me; but helsing says i must. we were all wild with
 excitement yesterday when godalming got his telegram from lloyd’s. i
 know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard. mrs.
 harker, alone of our party, did not show any signs of emotion. after
 all, it is not strange that she did not; for we took special care not to
 let her know anything about it, and we all tried not to show any
 excitement when we were in her presence. in old days she would, i am
 sure, have noticed, matter how we might have tried to conceal it; but
 in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks. the
 lethargy grows upon her, and though she seems strong and well, and is
 getting back some of her colour, helsing and i are not satisfied. we
 talk of her often; we have not, however, said word to the others. it
 would break poor harker’s heart--certainly his nerve--if knew that we
 had even suspicion on the subject. helsing examines, tells me,
 her teeth very carefully, whilst she is in the hypnotic condition, for
 says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is active
 danger of change in her. if this change should come, it would be
 necessary to take steps!... we both know what those steps would have to
 be, though we do not mention our thoughts to each other. we should
 neither of us shrink from the task--awful though it be to contemplate.
 “euthanasia” is an excellent and comforting word! i am grateful to
 whoever invented it.
 
it is only about 24 hours’ sail from the dardanelles to here, at the
 rate the _czarina catherine_ has come from london. she should therefore
 arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in
 before then, we are all about to retire early. we shall get up at one
 o’clock, so as to be ready.

_25 october, noon_.--no news yet of the ship’s arrival. mrs. harker’s
 hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual, so it is possible
 that we may get news at any moment. we men are all in fever of
 excitement, except harker, who is calm; his hands are cold as ice, and
 an hour ago i found him whetting the edge of the great ghoorka knife
 which now always carries with him. it will be bad lookout for the
 count if the edge of that “kukri” ever touches his throat, driven by
 that stern, ice-cold hand!
 
helsing and i were little alarmed about mrs. harker to-day. about
 noon she got into sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we
 kept silence to the others, we were neither of us happy about it. she
 had been restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know
 that she was sleeping. when, however, her husband mentioned casually
 that she was sleeping so soundly that could not wake her, we went to
 her room to see for ourselves. she was breathing naturally and looked so
 well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than
 anything else. poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is wonder
 that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--our opinion was justified, for when after refreshing sleep
 of some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she had
 been for days. at sunset she made the usual hypnotic report. wherever he
 may be in the black sea, the count is hurrying to his destination. to
 his doom, i trust!
 
* * * * *
 
_26 october._--another day and tidings of the _czarina catherine_.
 she ought to be here by now. that she is still journeying _somewhere_ is
 apparent, for mrs. harker’s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the
 same. it is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;
 some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog
 both to north and south of the port. we must continue our watching, as
 the ship may now be signalled any moment.
 
* * * * *
 
_27 october, noon._--most strange; news yet of the ship we wait for.
 mrs. harker reported last night and this morning as usual: “lapping
 waves and rushing water,” though she added that “the waves were very
 faint.” the telegrams from london have been the same: “no further
 report.” helsing is terribly anxious, and told just now that he
 fears the count is escaping us. added significantly:--
 
“i did not like that lethargy of madam mina’s. souls and memories can do
 strange things during trance.” i was about to ask him more, but harker
 just then came in, and held up warning hand. we must try to-night
 at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.
 
* * * * *
 
_28 october._--telegram. _rufus smith, london, to lord godalming,
 care h. b. m. vice consul, varna._
 
“_czarina catherine_ reported entering galatz at one o’clock
 to-day.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_28 october._--when the telegram came announcing the arrival in galatz i
 do not think it was such shock to any of us as might have been
 expected. true, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would
 come; but i think we all expected that something strange would happen.
 the delay of arrival at varna made us individually satisfied that things
 would not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the
 change would occur. none the less, however, was it surprise. i suppose
 that nature works on such hopeful basis that we believe against
 ourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should know
 that they will be. transcendentalism is beacon to the angels, even if
 it be will-o’-the-wisp to man. it was an odd experience and we all
 took it differently. helsing raised his hand over his head for a
 moment, as though in remonstrance with the almighty; but said not a
 word, and in few seconds stood up with his face sternly set. lord
 godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily. i was myself half
 stunned and looked in wonder at one after another. quincey morris
 tightened his belt with that quick movement which i knew so well; in our
 old wandering days it meant “action.” mrs. harker grew ghastly white, so
 that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands
 meekly and looked up in prayer. harker smiled--actually smiled--the
 dark, bitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his
 action belied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of
 the great kukri knife and rested there. “when does the next train start
 for galatz?” said helsing to us generally.
 
“at 6:30 to-morrow morning!” we all started, for the answer came from
 mrs. harker.
 
“how on earth do you know?” said art.
 
“you forget--or perhaps you do not know, though jonathan does and so
 does dr. helsing--that i am the train fiend. at home in exeter i
 always used to make up the time-tables, so as to be helpful to my
 husband. i found it so useful sometimes, that i always make study of
 the time-tables now. i knew that if anything were to take us to castle
 dracula we should go by galatz, or at any rate through bucharest, so i
 learned the times very carefully. unhappily there are not many to learn,
 as the only train to-morrow leaves as i say.”
 
“wonderful woman!” murmured the professor.
 
“can’t we get special?” asked lord godalming. helsing shook his
 head: “i fear not. this land is very different from yours or mine; even
 if we did have special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our
 regular train. moreover, we have something to prepare. we must think.
 now let us organize. you, friend arthur, go to the train and get the
 tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. do
 you, friend jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him
 letters to the agent in galatz, with authority to make search the ship
 just as it was here. morris quincey, you see the vice-consul, and get
 his aid with his fellow in galatz and all can do to make our way
 smooth, so that times be lost when over the danube. john will stay
 with madam mina and me, and we shall consult. for so if time be long you
 may be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since i am here
 with madam to make report.”
 
“and i,” said mrs. harker brightly, and more like her old self than she
 had been for many long day, “shall try to be of use in all ways, and
 shall think and write for you as i used to do. something is shifting
 from in some strange way, and i feel freer than i have been of late!”
 the three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to
 realise the significance of her words; but helsing and i, turning to
 each other, met each grave and troubled glance. we said nothing at the
 time, however.
 
when the three men had gone out to their tasks helsing asked mrs.
 harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of
 harker’s journal at the castle. she went away to get it; when the door
 was shut upon her said to me:--
 
“we mean the same! speak out!”
 
“there is some change. it is hope that makes sick, for it may
 deceive us.”
 
“quite so. do you know why i asked her to get the manuscript?”
 
“no!” said i, “unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing alone.”
 
“you are in part right, friend john, but only in part. i want to tell
 you something. and oh, my friend, i am taking great--a terrible--risk;
 but i believe it is right. in the moment when madam mina said those
 words that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration came to me. in
 the trance of three days ago the count sent her his spirit to read her
 mind; or more like took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship
 with water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun. learn
 then that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with
 eyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as is, in his coffin-box.
 now make his most effort to escape us. at present want her not.
 
“he is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;
 but cut her off--take her, as can do, out of his own power, that
 so she come not to him. ah! there i have hope that our man-brains that
 have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of god, will
 come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries,
 that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and
 therefore small. here comes madam mina; not word to her of her trance!
 she know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when
 we want all her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great
 brain which is trained like man’s brain, but is of sweet woman and have
 special power which the count give her, and which may not take away
 altogether--though think not so. hush! let speak, and you shall
 learn. oh, john, my friend, we are in awful straits. i fear, as i never
 feared before. we can only trust the good god. silence! here she comes!”
 
i thought that the professor was going to break down and have hysterics,
 just as had when lucy died, but with great effort controlled
 himself and was at perfect nervous poise when mrs. harker tripped into
 the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly
 forgetful of her misery. as she came in, she handed number of sheets
 of typewriting to helsing. looked over them gravely, his face
 brightening up as read. then holding the pages between his finger and
 thumb said:--
 
“friend john, to you with so much of experience already--and you, too,
 dear madam mina, that are young--here is lesson: do not fear ever to
 think. half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but i fear to
 let him loose his wings. here now, with more knowledge, i go back to
 where that half-thought come from and i find that be half-thought
 at all; that be whole thought, though so young that is not yet
 strong to use his little wings. nay, like the “ugly duck” of my friend
 hans andersen, be duck-thought at all, but big swan-thought that
 sail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them. see i
 read here what jonathan have written:--
 
“that other of his race who, in later age, again and again, brought
 his forces over the great river into turkey land; who, when was
 beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though had to come
 alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,
 since knew that alone could ultimately triumph.”
 
“what does this tell us? not much? no! the count’s child-thought see
 nothing; therefore speak so free. your man-thought see nothing; my
 man-thought see nothing, till just now. no! but there comes another word
 from some one who speak without thought because she, too, know not what
 it mean--what it _might_ mean. just as there are elements which rest,
 yet when in nature’s course they move on their way and they touch--then
 pouf! and there comes flash of light, heaven wide, that blind and kill
 and destroy some; but that show up all earth below for leagues and
 leagues. is it not so? well, i shall explain. to begin, have you ever
 study the philosophy of crime? ‘yes’ and ‘no.’ you, john, yes; for it is
 study of insanity. you, no, madam mina; for crime touch you not--not
 but once. still, your mind works true, and argues not _a particulari ad
 universale_. there is this peculiarity in criminals. it is so constant,
 in all countries and at all times, that even police, who know not much
 from philosophy, come to know it empirically, that _it is_. that is to
 be empiric. the criminal always work at one crime--that is the true
 criminal who seems predestinate to crime, and who will of none other.
 this criminal has not full man-brain. is clever and cunning and
 resourceful; but be not of man-stature as to brain. be of
 child-brain in much. now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime
 also; he, too, have child-brain, and it is of the child to do what he
 have done. the little bird, the little fish, the little animal learn not
 by principle, but empirically; and when learn to do, then there is to
 him the ground to start from to do more. ‘_dos pou sto_,’ said
 archimedes. ‘give fulcrum, and i shall move the world!’ to do once,
 is the fulcrum whereby child-brain become man-brain; and until have
 the purpose to do more, continue to do the same again every time,
 just as have done before! oh, my dear, i see that your eyes are
 opened, and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues,” for
 mrs. harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled. went on:--
 
“now you shall speak. tell us two dry men of science what you see with
 those so bright eyes.” took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.
 his finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as i thought instinctively and
 unconsciously, as she spoke:--
 
“the count is criminal and of criminal type. nordau and lombroso would
 so classify him, and _quâ_ criminal is of imperfectly formed mind.
 thus, in difficulty has to seek resource in habit. his past is a
 clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own
 lips--tells that once before, when in what mr. morris would call a
 ‘tight place,’ went back to his own country from the land had
 tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself
 for new effort. came again better equipped for his work; and won.
 so came to london to invade new land. was beaten, and when all
 hope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, fled back over
 the to his home; just as formerly had fled back over the danube
 from turkey land.”
 
“good, good! oh, you so clever lady!” said helsing,
 enthusiastically, as stooped and kissed her hand. moment later he
 said to me, as calmly as though we had been having sick-room
 consultation:--
 
“seventy-two only; and in all this excitement. i have hope.” turning to
 her again, said with keen expectation:--
 
“but go on. go on! there is more to tell if you will. be not afraid;
 john and i know. i do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.
 speak, without fear!”
 
“i will try to; but you will forgive if i seem egotistical.”
 
“nay! fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.”
 
“then, as is criminal is selfish; and as his intellect is small
 and his action is based on selfishness, confines himself to one
 purpose. that purpose is remorseless. as fled back over the danube,
 leaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now is intent on being
 safe, careless of all. so his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat
 from the terrible power which acquired over on that dreadful
 night. i felt it! oh, i felt it! thank god, for his great mercy! my soul
 is freer than it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me
 is fear lest in some trance or dream may have used my knowledge for
 his ends.” the professor stood up:--
 
“he has so used your mind; and by it has left us here in varna,
 whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to
 galatz, where, doubtless, had made preparation for escaping from us.
 but his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is in
 god’s providence, the very thing that the evil-doer most reckoned on for
 his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm. the hunter is taken
 in his own snare, as the great psalmist says. for now that think he
 is free from every trace of us all, and that has escaped us with so
 many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him to
 sleep. think, too, that as cut himself off from knowing your mind,
 there can be knowledge of him to you; there is where fail! that
 terrible baptism of blood which give you makes you free to go to him
 in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when the
 sun rise and set. at such times you go by my volition and not by his;
 and this power to good of you and others, as you have won from your
 suffering at his hands. this is now all the more precious that know
 it not, and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his
 knowledge of our where. we, however, are not selfish, and we believe
 that god is with us through all this blackness, and these many dark
 hours. we shall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril
 ourselves that we become like him. friend john, this has been great
 hour; and it have done much to advance us on our way. you must be scribe
 and write him all down, so that when the others return from their work
 you can give it to them; then they shall know as we do.”
 
and so i have written it whilst we wait their return, and mrs. harker
 has written with her typewriter all since she brought the ms. to us.
 



chapter xxvi
 
dr. seward’s diary
 

_29 october._--this is written in the train from varna to galatz. last
 night we all assembled little before the time of sunset. each of us
 had done his work as well as could; so far as thought, and endeavour,
 and opportunity go, we are prepared for the whole of our journey, and
 for our work when we get to galatz. when the usual time came round mrs.
 harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after longer and
 more serious effort on the part of helsing than has been usually
 necessary, she sank into the trance. usually she speaks on hint; but
 this time the professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty
 resolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--
 
“i can see nothing; we are still; there are waves lapping, but only a
 steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser. i can hear
 men’s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in
 the rowlocks. gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.
 there is tramping of feet overhead, and ropes and chains are dragged
 along. what is this? there is gleam of light; i can feel the air
 blowing upon me.”
 
here she stopped. she had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay
 on the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting a
 weight. helsing and i looked at each other with understanding.
 quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst
 harker’s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his kukri. there
 was long pause. we all knew that the time when she could speak was
 passing; but we felt that it was useless to say anything. suddenly she
 sat up, and, as she opened her eyes, said sweetly:--
 
“would none of you like cup of tea? you must all be so tired!” we
 could only make her happy, and so acquiesced. she bustled off to get
 tea; when she had gone helsing said:--
 
“you see, my friends. _he_ is close to land: has left his
 earth-chest. but has yet to get on shore. in the night may lie
 hidden somewhere; but if be not carried on shore, or if the ship do
 not touch it, cannot achieve the land. in such case can, if it be
 in the night, change his form and can jump or fly on shore, as did
 at whitby. but if the day come before get on shore, then, unless he
 be carried cannot escape. and if be carried, then the customs men
 may discover what the box contain. thus, in fine, if escape not on
 shore to-night, or before dawn, there will be the whole day lost to him.
 we may then arrive in time; for if escape not at night we shall come
 on him in daytime, boxed up and at our mercy; for dare not be his
 true self, awake and visible, lest be discovered.”
 
there was more to be said, so we waited in patience until the dawn;
 at which time we might learn more from mrs. harker.
 
early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her
 response in her trance. the hypnotic stage was even longer in coming
 than before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was
 so short that we began to despair. helsing seemed to throw his whole
 soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made
 reply:--
 
“all is dark. i hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as
 of wood on wood.” she paused, and the red sun shot up. we must wait till
 to-night.
 
and so it is that we are travelling towards galatz in an agony of
 expectation. we are due to arrive between two and three in the morning;
 but already, at bucharest, we are three hours late, so we cannot
 possibly get in till well after sun-up. thus we shall have two more
 hypnotic messages from mrs. harker; either or both may possibly throw
 more light on what is happening.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--sunset has come and gone. fortunately it came at time when
 there was distraction; for had it occurred whilst we were at a
 station, we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation.
 mrs. harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than
 this morning. i am in fear that her power of reading the count’s
 sensations may die away, just when we want it most. it seems to that
 her imagination is beginning to work. whilst she has been in the trance
 hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts. if this goes
 on it may ultimately mislead us. if i thought that the count’s power
 over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be
 happy thought; but i am afraid that it may not be so. when she did
 speak, her words were enigmatical:--
 
“something is going out; i can feel it pass like cold wind. i can
 hear, far off, confused sounds--as of men talking in strange tongues,
 fierce-falling water, and the howling of wolves.” she stopped and a
 shudder ran through her, increasing in intensity for few seconds,
 till, at the end, she shook as though in palsy. she said more, even
 in answer to the professor’s imperative questioning. when she woke from
 the trance, she was cold, and exhausted, and languid; but her mind was
 all alert. she could not remember anything, but asked what she had said;
 when she was told, she pondered over it deeply for long time and in
 silence.
 
* * * * *
 
_30 october, 7 a. m._--we are near galatz now, and i may not have time
 to write later. sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all.
 knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance,
 helsing began his passes earlier than usual. they produced no
 effect, however, until the regular time, when she yielded with still
 greater difficulty, only minute before the sun rose. the professor
 lost time in his questioning; her answer came with equal quickness:--
 
“all is dark. i hear water swirling by, level with my ears, and the
 creaking of wood on wood. cattle low far off. there is another sound, a
 queer one like----” she stopped and grew white, and whiter still.
 
“go on; go on! speak, i command you!” said helsing in an agonised
 voice. at the same time there was despair in his eyes, for the risen sun
 was reddening even mrs. harker’s pale face. she opened her eyes, and we
 all started as she said, sweetly and seemingly with the utmost
 unconcern:--
 
“oh, professor, why ask to do what you know i can’t? i don’t remember
 anything.” then, seeing the look of amazement on our faces, she said,
 turning from one to the other with troubled look:--
 
“what have i said? what have i done? i know nothing, only that i was
 lying here, half asleep, and heard you say ‘go on! speak, i command you!’
 it seemed so funny to hear you order about, as if i were bad
 child!”
 
“oh, madam mina,” said, sadly, “it is proof, if proof be needed, of
 how i love and honour you, when word for your good, spoken more
 earnest than ever, can seem so strange because it is to order her whom i
 am proud to obey!”
 
the whistles are sounding; we are nearing galatz. we are on fire with
 anxiety and eagerness.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_30 october._--mr. morris took to the hotel where our rooms had been
 ordered by telegraph, being the one who could best be spared, since
 does not speak any foreign language. the forces were distributed
 much as they had been at varna, except that lord godalming went to the
 vice-consul, as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some
 sort to the official, we being in extreme hurry. jonathan and the two
 doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival
 of the _czarina catherine_.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--lord godalming has returned. the consul is away, and the
 vice-consul sick; so the routine work has been attended to by clerk.
 was very obliging, and offered to do anything in his power.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_30 october._--at nine o’clock dr. helsing, dr. seward, and i called
 on messrs. mackenzie & steinkoff, the agents of the london firm of
 hapgood. they had received wire from london, in answer to lord
 godalming’s telegraphed request, asking us to show them any civility in
 their power. they were more than kind and courteous, and took us at once
 on board the _czarina catherine_, which lay at anchor out in the river
 harbour. there we saw the captain, donelson by name, who told us of his
 voyage. said that in all his life had never had so favourable a
 run.
 
“man!” said, “but it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should
 have to pay for it wi’ some rare piece o’ ill luck, so as to keep up the
 average. it’s canny to run frae london to the black wi’ wind
 ahint ye, as though the deil himself were blawin’ on yer sail for his
 ain purpose. an’ a’ the time we could speer thing. gin we were nigh
 ship, or port, or headland, fog fell on us and travelled wi’ us,
 till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil thing could
 we see. we ran by gibraltar wi’oot bein’ able to signal; an’ till we
 came to the dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass, we
 never were within hail o’ aught. at first i inclined to slack off sail
 and beat about till the fog was lifted; but whiles, i thocht that if the
 deil was minded to get us into the black quick, was like to do it
 whether we would or no. if we had quick voyage it would be to our
 miscredit wi’ the owners, or hurt to our traffic; an’ the old mon who
 had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no
 hinderin’ him.” this mixture of simplicity and cunning, of superstition
 and commercial reasoning, aroused helsing, who said:--
 
“mine friend, that devil is more clever than is thought by some; and
 know when meet his match!” the skipper was not displeased with the
 compliment, and went on:--
 
“when we got past the bosphorus the men began to grumble; some o’ them,
 the roumanians, came and asked to heave overboard big box which had
 been put on board by queer lookin’ old man just before we had started
 frae london. i had seen them speer at the fellow, and put out their twa
 fingers when they saw him, to guard against the evil eye. man! but the
 supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous! i sent them aboot
 their business pretty quick; but as just after fog closed in on us i
 felt wee bit as they did anent something, though i wouldn’t say it was
 agin the big box. well, on we went, and as the fog didn’t let up for
 five days i joost let the wind carry us; for if the deil wanted to get
 somewheres--well, would fetch it up a’reet. an’ if didn’t, well,
 we’d keep sharp lookout anyhow. sure eneuch, we had fair way and
 deep water all the time; and two days ago, when the mornin’ sun came
 through the fog, we found ourselves just in the river opposite galatz.
 the roumanians were wild, and wanted right or wrong to take out the
 box and fling it in the river. i had to argy wi’ them aboot it wi’ a
 handspike; an’ when the last o’ them rose off the deck wi’ his head in
 his hand, i had convinced them that, evil eye or evil eye, the
 property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the
 river danube. they had, mind ye, taken the box on the deck ready to
 fling in, and as it was marked galatz _via_ varna, i thocht i’d let it
 lie till we discharged in the port an’ get rid o’t althegither. we
 didn’t do much clearin’ that day, an’ had to remain the nicht at anchor;
 but in the mornin’, braw an’ airly, an hour before sun-up, man came
 aboard wi’ an order, written to him from england, to receive box
 marked for one count dracula. sure eneuch the matter was one ready to
 his hand. had his papers a’ reet, an’ glad i was to be rid o’ the
 dam’ thing, for i was beginnin’ masel’ to feel uneasy at it. if the deil
 did have any luggage aboord the ship, i’m thinkin’ it was nane ither
 than that same!”
 
“what was the name of the man who took it?” asked dr. helsing with
 restrained eagerness.
 
“i’ll be tellin’ ye quick!” answered, and, stepping down to his
 cabin, produced receipt signed “immanuel hildesheim.” burgen-strasse
 16 was the address. we found out that this was all the captain knew; so
 with thanks we came away.
 
we found hildesheim in his office, hebrew of rather the adelphi
 theatre type, with nose like sheep, and fez. his arguments were
 pointed with specie--we doing the punctuation--and with little
 bargaining told us what knew. this turned out to be simple but
 important. had received letter from mr. ville of london, telling
 him to receive, if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs, box
 which would arrive at galatz in the _czarina catherine_. this was to
 give in charge to certain petrof skinsky, who dealt with the slovaks
 who traded down the river to the port. had been paid for his work by
 an english bank note, which had been duly cashed for gold at the danube
 international bank. when skinsky had come to him, had taken him to
 the ship and handed over the box, so as to save porterage. that was all
 knew.
 
we then sought for skinsky, but were unable to find him. one of his
 neighbours, who did not seem to bear him any affection, said that had
 gone away two days before, one knew whither. this was corroborated by
 his landlord, who had received by messenger the key of the house
 together with the rent due, in english money. this had been between ten
 and eleven o’clock last night. we were at standstill again.
 
whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that
 the body of skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of
 st. peter, and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild
 animal. those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror, the
 women crying out “this is the work of slovak!” we hurried away lest we
 should have been in some way drawn into the affair, and so detained.
 
as we came home we could arrive at definite conclusion. we were all
 convinced that the box was on its way, by water, to somewhere; but where
 that might be we would have to discover. with heavy hearts we came home
 to the hotel to mina.
 
when we met together, the first thing was to consult as to taking mina
 again into our confidence. things are getting desperate, and it is at
 least chance, though hazardous one. as preliminary step, i was
 released from my promise to her.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_30 october, evening._--they were so tired and worn out and dispirited
 that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest; so i asked
 them all to lie down for half an hour whilst i should enter everything
 up to the moment. i feel so grateful to the man who invented the
 “traveller’s” typewriter, and to mr. morris for getting this one for
 me. i should have felt quite astray doing the work if i had to write
 with pen....
 
it is all done; poor dear, dear jonathan, what must have suffered,
 what must be suffering now. lies on the sofa hardly seeming to
 breathe, and his whole body appears in collapse. his brows are knit; his
 face is drawn with pain. poor fellow, maybe is thinking, and i can
 see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts. oh!
 if i could only help at all.... i shall do what i can.
 
i have asked dr. helsing, and has got all the papers that i
 have not yet seen.... whilst they are resting, i shall go over all
 carefully, and perhaps i may arrive at some conclusion. i shall try to
 follow the professor’s example, and think without prejudice on the facts
 before me....
 
* * * * *
 
i do believe that under god’s providence i have made discovery. i
 shall get the maps and look over them....
 
* * * * *
 
i am more than ever sure that i am right. my new conclusion is ready, so
 i shall get our party together and read it. they can judge it; it is
 well to be accurate, and every minute is precious.
 

_mina harker’s memorandum._
 
(entered in her journal.)
 
_ground of inquiry._--count dracula’s problem is to get back to his own
 place.
 
(_a_) must be _brought back_ by some one. this is evident; for had he
 power to move himself as wished could go either as man, or wolf,
 or bat, or in some other way. evidently fears discovery or
 interference, in the state of helplessness in which must be--confined
 as is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box.
 
(_b_) _how is to be taken?_--here process of exclusions may help
 us. by road, by rail, by water?
 
1. _by road._--there are endless difficulties, especially in leaving the
 city.
 
(_x_) there are people; and people are curious, and investigate. hint,
 surmise, doubt as to what might be in the box, would destroy him.
 
(_y_) there are, or there may be, customs and octroi officers to pass.
 
(_z_) his pursuers might follow. this is his highest fear; and in order
 to prevent his being betrayed has repelled, so far as can, even
 his victim--me!
 
2. _by rail._--there is one in charge of the box. it would have to
 take its chance of being delayed; and delay would be fatal, with enemies
 on the track. true, might escape at night; but what would be, if
 left in strange place with refuge that could fly to? this is not
 what intends; and does not mean to risk it.
 
3. _by water._--here is the safest way, in one respect, but with most
 danger in another. on the water is powerless except at night; even
 then can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves. but were
 wrecked, the living water would engulf him, helpless; and would
 indeed be lost. could have the vessel drive to land; but if it were
 unfriendly land, wherein was not free to move, his position would
 still be desperate.
 
we know from the record that was on the water; so what we have to do
 is to ascertain _what_ water.
 
the first thing is to realise exactly what has done as yet; we may,
 then, get light on what his later task is to be.
 
_firstly._--we must differentiate between what did in london as part
 of his general plan of action, when was pressed for moments and had
 to arrange as best could.
 
_secondly_ we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we
 know of, what has done here.
 
as to the first, evidently intended to arrive at galatz, and sent
 invoice to varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of
 exit from england; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape.
 the proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to immanuel
 hildesheim to clear and take away the box _before sunrise_. there is
 also the instruction to petrof skinsky. these we must only guess at; but
 there must have been some letter or message, since skinsky came to
 hildesheim.
 
that, so far, his plans were successful we know. the _czarina catherine_
 made phenomenally quick journey--so much so that captain donelson’s
 suspicions were aroused; but his superstition united with his canniness
 played the count’s game for him, and ran with his favouring wind
 through fogs and all till brought up blindfold at galatz. that the
 count’s arrangements were well made, has been proved. hildesheim cleared
 the box, took it off, and gave it to skinsky. skinsky took it--and here
 we lose the trail. we only know that the box is somewhere on the water,
 moving along. the customs and the octroi, if there be any, have been
 avoided.
 
now we come to what the count must have done after his arrival--_on
 land_, at galatz.
 
the box was given to skinsky before sunrise. at sunrise the count could
 appear in his own form. here, we ask why skinsky was chosen at all to
 aid in the work? in my husband’s diary, skinsky is mentioned as dealing
 with the slovaks who trade down the river to the port; and the man’s
 remark, that the murder was the work of slovak, showed the general
 feeling against his class. the count wanted isolation.
 
my surmise is, this: that in london the count decided to get back to his
 castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. was brought from
 the castle by szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to slovaks
 who took the boxes to varna, for there they were shipped for london.
 thus the count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this
 service. when the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he
 came out from his box, met skinsky and instructed him what to do as to
 arranging the carriage of the box up some river. when this was done, and
 knew that all was in train, blotted out his traces, as thought,
 by murdering his agent.
 
i have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the
 slovaks to have ascended is either the pruth or the sereth. i read in
 the typescript that in my trance i heard cows low and water swirling
 level with my ears and the creaking of wood. the count in his box, then,
 was on river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or
 poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. there
 would be such sound if floating down stream.
 
of course it may not be either the sereth or the pruth, but we may
 possibly investigate further. now of these two, the pruth is the more
 easily navigated, but the sereth is, at fundu, joined by the bistritza
 which runs up round the borgo pass. the loop it makes is manifestly as
 close to dracula’s castle as can be got by water.
 

_mina harker’s journal--continued._
 
when i had done reading, jonathan took in his arms and kissed me. the
 others kept shaking by both hands, and dr. helsing said:--
 
“our dear madam mina is once more our teacher. her eyes have been where
 we were blinded. now we are on the track once again, and this time we
 may succeed. our enemy is at his most helpless; and if we can come on
 him by day, on the water, our task will be over. has start, but he
 is powerless to hasten, as may not leave his box lest those who carry
 him may suspect; for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw
 him in the stream where perish. this knows, and will not. now men,
 to our council of war; for, here and now, we must plan what each and all
 shall do.”
 
“i shall get steam launch and follow him,” said lord godalming.
 
“and i, horses to follow on the bank lest by chance land,” said mr.
 morris.
 
“good!” said the professor, “both good. but neither must go alone. there
 must be force to overcome force if need be; the slovak is strong and
 rough, and carries rude arms.” all the men smiled, for amongst them
 they carried small arsenal. said mr. morris:--
 
“i have brought some winchesters; they are pretty handy in crowd, and
 there may be wolves. the count, if you remember, took some other
 precautions; made some requisitions on others that mrs. harker could
 not quite hear or understand. we must be ready at all points.” dr.
 seward said:--
 
“i think i had better go with quincey. we have been accustomed to hunt
 together, and we two, well armed, will be match for whatever may come
 along. you must not be alone, art. it may be necessary to fight the
 slovaks, and chance thrust--for i don’t suppose these fellows carry
 guns--would undo all our plans. there must be chances, this time; we
 shall not rest until the count’s head and body have been separated, and
 we are sure that cannot re-incarnate.” looked at jonathan as he
 spoke, and jonathan looked at me. i could see that the poor dear was
 torn about in his mind. of course wanted to be with me; but then the
 boat service would, most likely, be the one which would destroy the ...
 the ... the ... vampire. (why did i hesitate to write the word?) was
 silent awhile, and during his silence dr. helsing spoke:--
 
“friend jonathan, this is to you for twice reasons. first, because you
 are young and brave and can fight, and all energies may be needed at the
 last; and again that it is your right to destroy him--that--which has
 wrought such woe to you and yours. be not afraid for madam mina; she
 will be my care, if i may. i am old. my legs are not so quick to run as
 once; and i am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be, or to
 fight with lethal weapons. but i can be of other service; i can fight in
 other way. and i can die, if need be, as well as younger men. now let
 say that what i would is this: while you, my lord godalming and
 friend jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river, and
 whilst john and quincey guard the bank where perchance might be
 landed, i will take madam mina right into the heart of the enemy’s
 country. whilst the old fox is tied in his box, floating on the running
 stream whence cannot escape to land--where dares not raise the lid
 of his coffin-box lest his slovak carriers should in fear leave him to
 perish--we shall go in the track where jonathan went,--from bistritz
 over the borgo, and find our way to the castle of dracula. here, madam
 mina’s hypnotic power will surely help, and we shall find our way--all
 dark and unknown otherwise--after the first sunrise when we are near
 that fateful place. there is much to be done, and other places to be
 made sanctify, so that that nest of vipers be obliterated.” here
 jonathan interrupted him hotly:--
 
“do you mean to say, professor helsing, that you would bring mina,
 in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil’s illness, right
 into the jaws of his death-trap? not for the world! not for heaven or
 hell!” became almost speechless for minute, and then went on:--
 
“do you know what the place is? have you seen that awful den of hellish
 infamy--with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes, and every
 speck of dust that whirls in the wind devouring monster in embryo?
 have you felt the vampire’s lips upon your throat?” here turned to
 me, and as his eyes lit on my forehead threw up his arms with cry:
 “oh, my god, what have we done to have this terror upon us!” and sank
 down on the sofa in collapse of misery. the professor’s voice, as he
 spoke in clear, sweet tones, which seemed to vibrate in the air, calmed
 us all:--
 
“oh, my friend, it is because i would save madam mina from that awful
 place that i would go. god forbid that i should take her into that
 place. there is work--wild work--to be done there, that her eyes may not
 see. we men here, all save jonathan, have seen with their own eyes what
 is to be done before that place can be purify. remember that we are in
 terrible straits. if the count escape us this time--and is strong and
 subtle and cunning--he may choose to sleep him for century, and then
 in time our dear one”--he took my hand--“would come to him to keep him
 company, and would be as those others that you, jonathan, saw. you have
 told us of their gloating lips; you heard their ribald laugh as they
 clutched the moving bag that the count threw to them. you shudder; and
 well may it be. forgive that i make you so much pain, but it is
 necessary. my friend, is it not dire need for the which i am giving,
 possibly my life? if it were that any one went into that place to stay,
 it is i who would have to go to keep them company.”
 
“do as you will,” said jonathan, with sob that shook him all over, “we
 are in the hands of god!”
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--oh, it did good to see the way that these brave men worked.
 how can women help loving men when they are so earnest, and so true, and
 so brave! and, too, it made think of the wonderful power of money!
 what can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do
 when basely used. i felt so thankful that lord godalming is rich, and
 that both and mr. morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing
 to spend it so freely. for if they did not, our little expedition could
 not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within
 another hour. it is not three hours since it was arranged what part each
 of us was to do; and now lord godalming and jonathan have lovely steam
 launch, with steam up ready to start at moment’s notice. dr. seward
 and mr. morris have half dozen good horses, well appointed. we have
 all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had. professor
 helsing and i are to leave by the 11:40 train to-night for veresti,
 where we are to get carriage to drive to the borgo pass. we are
 bringing good deal of ready money, as we are to buy carriage and
 horses. we shall drive ourselves, for we have one whom we can trust
 in the matter. the professor knows something of great many languages,
 so we shall get on all right. we have all got arms, even for a
 large-bore revolver; jonathan would not be happy unless i was armed like
 the rest. alas! i cannot carry one arm that the rest do; the scar on my
 forehead forbids that. dear dr. helsing comforts by telling me
 that i am fully armed as there may be wolves; the weather is getting
 colder every hour, and there are snow-flurries which come and go as
 warnings.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--it took all my courage to say good-bye to my darling. we may
 never meet again. courage, mina! the professor is looking at you keenly;
 his look is warning. there must be tears now--unless it may be that
 god will let them fall in gladness.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_october 30. night._--i am writing this in the light from the furnace
 door of the steam launch: lord godalming is firing up. is an
 experienced hand at the work, as has had for years launch of his
 own on the thames, and another on the norfolk broads. regarding our
 plans, we finally decided that mina’s guess was correct, and that if any
 waterway was chosen for the count’s escape back to his castle, the
 sereth and then the bistritza at its junction, would be the one. we took
 it, that somewhere about the 47th degree, north latitude, would be the
 place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the
 carpathians. we have fear in running at good speed up the river at
 night; there is plenty of water, and the banks are wide enough apart to
 make steaming, even in the dark, easy enough. lord godalming tells to
 sleep for while, as it is enough for the present for one to be on
 watch. but i cannot sleep--how can i with the terrible danger hanging
 over my darling, and her going out into that awful place.... my only
 comfort is that we are in the hands of god. only for that faith it would
 be easier to die than to live, and so be quit of all the trouble. mr.
 morris and dr. seward were off on their long ride before we started;
 they are to keep up the right bank, far enough off to get on higher
 lands where they can see good stretch of river and avoid the following
 of its curves. they have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead
 their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. when
 they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look
 after the horses. it may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they
 can mount our whole party. one of the saddles has movable horn, and
 can be easily adapted for mina, if required.
 
it is wild adventure we are on. here, as we are rushing along through
 the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike
 us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes
 home. we seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into
 whole world of dark and dreadful things. godalming is shutting the
 furnace door....
 
* * * * *
 
_31 october._--still hurrying along. the day has come, and godalming is
 sleeping. i am on watch. the morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat
 is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. as yet we have passed only
 few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of
 anything like the size of the one we seek. the men were scared every
 time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and
 prayed.
 
* * * * *
 
_1 november, evening._--no news all day; we have found nothing of the
 kind we seek. we have now passed into the bistritza; and if we are wrong
 in our surmise our chance is gone. we have over-hauled every boat, big
 and little. early this morning, one crew took us for government boat,
 and treated us accordingly. we saw in this way of smoothing matters,
 so at fundu, where the bistritza runs into the sereth, we got a
 roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. with every boat which we
 have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every
 deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose
 to ask or do. some of the slovaks tell us that big boat passed them,
 going at more than usual speed as she had double crew on board. this
 was before they came to fundu, so they could not tell us whether the
 boat turned into the bistritza or continued on up the sereth. at fundu
 we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the
 night. i am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell
 upon me, and nature must have rest some time. godalming insists that he
 shall keep the first watch. god bless him for all his goodness to poor
 dear mina and me.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 november, morning._--it is broad daylight. that good fellow would not
 wake me. says it would have been to, for i slept peacefully and
 was forgetting my trouble. it seems brutally selfish to to have slept
 so long, and let him watch all night; but was quite right. i am new
 man this morning; and, as i sit here and watch him sleeping, i can do
 all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and
 keeping watch. i can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to
 me. i wonder where mina is now, and helsing. they should have got to
 veresti about noon on wednesday. it would take them some time to get the
 carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they
 would be about now at the borgo pass. god guide and help them! i am
 afraid to think what may happen. if we could only go faster! but we
 cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. i wonder how
 dr. seward and mr. morris are getting on. there seem to be endless
 streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them
 are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible
 doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have
 met much obstruction. i hope that before we get to strasba we may see
 them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the count, it may be
 necessary to take counsel together what to do next.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_2 november._--three days on the road. news, and time to write it
 if there had been, for every moment is precious. we have had only the
 rest needful for the horses; but we are both bearing it wonderfully.
 those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful. we must push on;
 we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again.
 
* * * * *
 
_3 november._--we heard at fundu that the launch had gone up the
 bistritza. i wish it wasn’t so cold. there are signs of snow coming; and
 if it falls heavy it will stop us. in such case we must get sledge and
 go on, russian fashion.
 
* * * * *
 
_4 november._--to-day we heard of the launch having been detained by an
 accident when trying to force way up the rapids. the slovak boats get
 up all right, by aid of rope and steering with knowledge. some went up
 only few hours before. godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and
 evidently it was who put the launch in trim again. finally, they got
 up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase
 afresh. i fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the
 peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept
 stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. we must push
 on harder than ever; our help may be wanted soon.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_31 october._--arrived at veresti at noon. the professor tells that
 this morning at dawn could hardly hypnotise at all, and that all i
 could say was: “dark and quiet.” is off now buying carriage and
 horses. says that will later on try to buy additional horses, so
 that we may be able to change them on the way. we have something more
 than 70 miles before us. the country is lovely, and most interesting; if
 only we were under different conditions, how delightful it would be to
 see it all. if jonathan and i were driving through it alone what a
 pleasure it would be. to stop and see people, and learn something of
 their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and
 picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint
 people! but, alas!--
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--dr. helsing has returned. has got the carriage and
 horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. the
 landlady is putting us up huge basket of provisions; it seems enough
 for company of soldiers. the professor encourages her, and whispers to
 that it may be week before we can get any good food again. has
 been shopping too, and has sent home such wonderful lot of fur coats
 and wraps, and all sorts of warm things. there will not be any chance of
 our being cold.
 
* * * * *
 
we shall soon be off. i am afraid to think what may happen to us. we are
 truly in the hands of god. alone knows what may be, and i pray him,
 with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that will watch over
 my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, jonathan may know that i
 loved him and honoured him more than i can say, and that my latest and
 truest thought will be always for him.
 



chapter xxvii
 
mina harker’s journal
 

_1 november._--all day long we have travelled, and at good speed. the
 horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go
 willingly their full stage at best speed. we have now had so many
 changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to
 think that the journey will be an easy one. dr. helsing is laconic;
 tells the farmers that is hurrying to bistritz, and pays them well
 to make the exchange of horses. we get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and
 off we go. it is lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable
 kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full
 of nice qualities. they are _very, very_ superstitious. in the first
 house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my
 forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to
 keep off the evil eye. i believe they went to the trouble of putting an
 extra amount of garlic into our food; and i can’t abide garlic. ever
 since then i have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
 escaped their suspicions. we are travelling fast, and as we have no
 driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but i daresay
 that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. the
 professor seems tireless; all day would not take any rest, though he
 made sleep for long spell. at sunset time hypnotised me, and he
 says that i answered as usual “darkness, lapping water and creaking
 wood”; so our enemy is still on the river. i am afraid to think of
 jonathan, but somehow i have now fear for him, or for myself. i write
 this whilst we wait in farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. dr.
 helsing is sleeping. poor dear, looks very tired and old and
 grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as conqueror’s; even in his sleep
 is instinct with resolution. when we have well started i must make
 him rest whilst i drive. i shall tell him that we have days before us,
 and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be
 needed.... all is ready; we are off shortly.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 november, morning._--i was successful, and we took turns driving all
 night; now the day is on us, bright though cold. there is strange
 heaviness in the air--i say heaviness for want of better word; i mean
 that it oppresses us both. it is very cold, and only our warm furs keep
 us comfortable. at dawn helsing hypnotised me; says i answered
 “darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,” so the river is changing as
 they ascend. i do hope that my darling will not run any chance of
 danger--more than need be; but we are in god’s hands.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 november, night._--all day long driving. the country gets wilder as
 we go, and the great spurs of the carpathians, which at veresti seemed
 so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us
 and tower in front. we both seem in good spirits; i think we make an
 effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. dr.
 helsing says that by morning we shall reach the borgo pass. the
 houses are very few here now, and the professor says that the last horse
 we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. he
 got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have rude
 four-in-hand. the dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no
 trouble. we are not worried with other travellers, and so even i can
 drive. we shall get to the pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive
 before. so we take it easy, and have each long rest in turn. oh, what
 will to-morrow bring to us? we go to seek the place where my poor
 darling suffered so much. god grant that we may be guided aright, and
 that will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,
 and who are in such deadly peril. as for me, i am not worthy in his
 sight. alas! i am unclean to his eyes, and shall be until may deign
 to let stand forth in his sight as one of those who have not incurred
 his wrath.
 

_memorandum by abraham helsing._
 
_4 november._--this to my old and true friend john seward, m.d., of
 purfleet, london, in case i may not see him. it may explain. it is
 morning, and i write by fire which all the night i have kept
 alive--madam mina aiding me. it is cold, cold; so cold that the grey
 heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all
 winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. it seems to have
 affected madam mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was
 not like herself. she sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! she who is usual
 so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost
 her appetite. she make entry into her little diary, she who write so
 faithful at every pause. something whisper to that all is not well.
 however, to-night she is more _vif_. her long sleep all day have refresh
 and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. at sunset
 i try to hypnotise her, but alas! with effect; the power has grown
 less and less with each day, and to-night it fail altogether. well,
 god’s will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!
 
now to the historical, for as madam mina write not in her stenography, i
 must, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go
 unrecorded.
 
we got to the borgo pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. when i
 saw the signs of the dawn i got ready for the hypnotism. we stopped our
 carriage, and got down so that there might be disturbance. i made a
 couch with furs, and madam mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but
 more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. as
 before, came the answer: “darkness and the swirling of water.” then she
 woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the pass.
 at this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new
 guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to road and say:--
 
“this is the way.”
 
“how know you it?” i ask.
 
“of course i know it,” she answer, and with pause, add: “have not my
 jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?”
 
at first i think somewhat strange, but soon i see that there be only one
 such by-road. it is used but little, and very different from the coach
 road from the bukovina to bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and
 more of use.
 
so we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we
 sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow
 have fallen--the horses know and they only. i give rein to them, and
 they go on so patient. by-and-by we find all the things which jonathan
 have note in that wonderful diary of him. then we go on for long, long
 hours and hours. at the first, i tell madam mina to sleep; she try, and
 she succeed. she sleep all the time; till at the last, i feel myself to
 suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. but she sleep on, and i may
 not wake her though i try. i do not wish to try too hard lest i harm
 her; for i know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be
 all-in-all to her. i think i drowse myself, for all of sudden i feel
 guilt, as though i have done something; i find myself bolt up, with the
 reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. i
 look down and find madam mina still sleep. it is now not far off sunset
 time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,
 so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
 for we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though
 it were the end of the world.
 
then i arouse madam mina. this time she wake with not much trouble, and
 then i try to put her to hypnotic sleep. but she sleep not, being as
 though i were not. still i try and try, till all at once i find her and
 myself in dark; so i look round, and find that the sun have gone down.
 madam mina laugh, and i turn and look at her. she is now quite awake,
 and look so well as i never saw her since that night at carfax when we
 first enter the count’s house. i am amaze, and not at ease then; but she
 is so bright and tender and thoughtful for that i forget all fear. i
 light fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she
 prepare food while i undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,
 to feed. then when i return to the fire she have my supper ready. i go
 to help her; but she smile, and tell that she have eat already--that
 she was so hungry that she would not wait. i like it not, and i have
 grave doubts; but i fear to affright her, and so i am silent of it. she
 help and i eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the
 fire, and i tell her to sleep while i watch. but presently i forget all
 of watching; and when i sudden remember that i watch, i find her lying
 quiet, but awake, and looking at with so bright eyes. once, twice
 more the same occur, and i get much sleep till before morning. when i
 wake i try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes
 obedient, she may not sleep. the sun rise up, and up, and up; and then
 sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. i have
 to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when i have
 harnessed the horses and made all ready. madam still sleep, and she look
 in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. and i like it
 not. and i am afraid, afraid, afraid!--i am afraid of all things--even
 to think but i must go on my way. the stake we play for is life and
 death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.
 
* * * * *
 
_5 november, morning._--let be accurate in everything, for though you
 and i have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think
 that i, helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long
 strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.
 
all yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and
 moving into more and more wild and desert land. there are great,
 frowning precipices and much falling water, and nature seem to have held
 sometime her carnival. madam mina still sleep and sleep; and though i
 did have hunger and appeased it, i could not waken her--even for food. i
 began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as
 she is with that vampire baptism. “well,” said i to myself, “if it be
 that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that i do not sleep at
 night.” as we travel on the rough road, for road of an ancient and
 imperfect kind there was, i held down my head and slept. again i waked
 with sense of guilt and of time passed, and found madam mina still
 sleeping, and the sun low down. but all was indeed changed; the frowning
 mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a
 steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such castle as jonathan tell
 of in his diary. at once i exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,
 the end was near.
 
i woke madam mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!
 unavailing till too late. then, ere the great dark came upon us--for
 even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and
 all was for time in great twilight--i took out the horses and fed
 them in what shelter i could. then i make fire; and near it i make
 madam mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid
 her rugs. i got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that
 she had not hunger. i did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. but
 i myself eat, for i must needs now be strong for all. then, with the
 fear on of what might be, i drew ring so big for her comfort, round
 where madam mina sat; and over the ring i passed some of the wafer, and
 i broke it fine so that all was well guarded. she sat still all the
 time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the
 snow was not more pale; and word she said. but when i drew near, she
 clung to me, and i could know that the poor soul shook her from head to
 feet with tremor that was pain to feel. i said to her presently, when
 she had grown more quiet:--
 
“will you not come over to the fire?” for i wished to make test of
 what she could. she rose obedient, but when she have made step she
 stopped, and stood as one stricken.
 
“why not go on?” i asked. she shook her head, and, coming back, sat
 down in her place. then, looking at with open eyes, as of one waked
 from sleep, she said simply:--
 
“i cannot!” and remained silent. i rejoiced, for i knew that what she
 could not, none of those that we dreaded could. though there might be
 danger to her body, yet her soul was safe!
 
presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till i
 came to them and quieted them. when they did feel my hands on them, they
 whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a
 time. many times through the night did i come to them, till it arrive to
 the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was
 with quiet of them. in the cold hour the fire began to die, and i was
 about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying
 sweeps and with it chill mist. even in the dark there was light of
 some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the
 snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with
 trailing garments. all was in dead, grim silence only that the horses
 whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. i began to
 fear--horrible fears; but then came to the sense of safety in that
 ring wherein i stood. i began, too, to think that my imaginings were of
 the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that i have gone through, and
 all the terrible anxiety. it was as though my memories of all jonathan’s
 horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist
 began to wheel and circle round, till i could get as though shadowy
 glimpse of those women that would have kissed him. and then the horses
 cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. even
 the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. i
 feared for my dear madam mina when these weird figures drew near and
 circled round. i looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when
 i would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught and held
 back, and whispered, like voice that one hears in dream, so low
 it was:--
 
“no! no! do not go without. here you are safe!” i turned to her, and
 looking in her eyes, said:--
 
“but you? it is for you that i fear!” whereat she laughed--a laugh, low
 and unreal, and said:--
 
“fear for _me_! why fear for me? none safer in all the world from them
 than i am,” and as i wondered at the meaning of her words, puff of
 wind made the flame leap up, and i see the red scar on her forehead.
 then, alas! i knew. did i not, i would soon have learned, for the
 wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without
 the holy circle. then they began to materialise till--if god have not
 take away my reason, for i saw it through my eyes--there were before me
 in actual flesh the same three women that jonathan saw in the room, when
 they would have kissed his throat. i knew the swaying round forms, the
 bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous
 lips. they smiled ever at poor dear madam mina; and as their laugh came
 through the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to
 her, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that jonathan said were
 of the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--
 
“come, sister. come to us. come! come!” in fear i turned to my poor
 madam mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the
 terror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told story to my
 heart that was all of hope. god be thanked she was not, yet, of them. i
 seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the
 wafer, advanced on them towards the fire. they drew back before me, and
 laughed their low horrid laugh. i fed the fire, and feared them not; for
 i knew that we were safe within our protections. they could not
 approach, me, whilst so armed, nor madam mina whilst she remained within
 the ring, which she could not leave more than they could enter. the
 horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on
 them softly, and they grew whiter. i knew that there was for the poor
 beasts more of terror.
 
and so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the
 snow-gloom. i was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but
 when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to again.
 at the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the
 whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away
 towards the castle, and were lost.
 
instinctively, with the dawn coming, i turned to madam mina, intending
 to hypnotise her; but she lay in deep and sudden sleep, from which i
 could not wake her. i tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made
 response, none at all; and the day broke. i fear yet to stir. i have
 made my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. to-day i have
 much to do here, and i keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there
 may be places where i must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist
 obscure it, will be to safety.
 
i will strengthen with breakfast, and then i will to my terrible
 work. madam mina still sleeps; and, god be thanked! she is calm in her
 sleep....
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_4 november, evening._--the accident to the launch has been terrible
 thing for us. only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;
 and by now my dear mina would have been free. i fear to think of her,
 off on the wolds near that horrid place. we have got horses, and we
 follow on the track. i note this whilst godalming is getting ready. we
 have our arms. the szgany must look out if they mean fight. oh, if only
 morris and seward were with us. we must only hope! if i write more
 good-bye, mina! god bless and keep you.
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_5 november._--with the dawn we saw the body of szgany before us dashing
 away from the river with their leiter-wagon. they surrounded it in a
 cluster, and hurried along as though beset. the snow is falling lightly
 and there is strange excitement in the air. it may be our own
 feelings, but the depression is strange. far off i hear the howling of
 wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are
 dangers to all of us, and from all sides. the horses are nearly ready,
 and we are soon off. we ride to death of some one. god alone knows who,
 or where, or what, or when, or how it may be....
 

_dr. helsing’s memorandum._
 
_5 november, afternoon._--i am at least sane. thank god for that mercy
 at all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. when i left
 madam mina sleeping within the holy circle, i took my way to the castle.
 the blacksmith hammer which i took in the carriage from veresti was
 useful; though the doors were all open i broke them off the rusty
 hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that
 being entered i might not get out. jonathan’s bitter experience served
 here. by memory of his diary i found my way to the old chapel, for i
 knew that here my work lay. the air was oppressive; it seemed as if
 there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made dizzy. either
 there was roaring in my ears or i heard afar off the howl of wolves.
 then i bethought of my dear madam mina, and i was in terrible plight.
 the dilemma had between his horns.
 
her, i had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the
 vampire in that holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! i
 resolve that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must
 submit, if it were god’s will. at any rate it was only death and
 freedom beyond. so did i choose for her. had it but been for myself the
 choice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than
 the grave of the vampire! so i make my choice to go on with my work.
 
i knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are
 inhabit; so i search, and search, and i find one of them. she lay in her
 vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that i shudder as
 though i have come to do murder. ah, i doubt not that in old time, when
 such things were, many man who set forth to do such task as mine,
 found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. so delay,
 and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the
 wanton un-dead have hypnotise him; and remain on and on, till sunset
 come, and the vampire sleep be over. then the beautiful eyes of the fair
 woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a
 kiss--and man is weak. and there remain one more victim in the vampire
 fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the un-dead!...
 
there is some fascination, surely, when i am moved by the mere presence
 of such an one, even lying as she lay in tomb fretted with age and
 heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such
 as the lairs of the count have had. yes, i was moved--i, helsing,
 with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--i was moved to a
 yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my
 very soul. it may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the
 strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. certain it
 was that i was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields
 to sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a
 long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke like the sound
 of clarion. for it was the voice of my dear madam mina that i heard.
 
then i braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching
 away tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. i dared not
 pause to look on her as i had on her sister, lest once more i should
 begin to be enthrall; but i go on searching until, presently, i find in
 high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister
 which, like jonathan i had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of
 the mist. she was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so
 exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls
 some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl
 with new emotion. but god be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear madam
 mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought
 further upon me, i had nerved myself to my wild work. by this time i had
 searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as i could tell; and as
 there had been only three of these un-dead phantoms around us in the
 night, i took it that there were more of active un-dead existent.
 there was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and
 nobly proportioned. on it was but one word
 
dracula.
 
this then was the un-dead home of the king-vampire, to whom so many more
 were due. its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what i knew.
 before i began to restore these women to their dead selves through my
 awful work, i laid in dracula’s tomb some of the wafer, and so banished
 him from it, un-dead, for ever.
 
then began my terrible task, and i dreaded it. had it been but one, it
 had been easy, comparative. but three! to begin twice more after i had
 been through deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet
 miss lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived
 through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the
 years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....
 
oh, my friend john, but it was butcher work; had i not been nerved by
 thoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such pall of
 fear, i could not have gone on. i tremble and tremble even yet, though
 till all was over, god be thanked, my nerve did stand. had i not seen
 the repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just
 ere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been
 won, i could not have gone further with my butchery. i could not have
 endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of
 writhing form, and lips of bloody foam. i should have fled in terror and
 left my work undone. but it is over! and the poor souls, i can pity them
 now and weep, as i think of them placid each in her full sleep of death
 for short moment ere fading. for, friend john, hardly had my knife
 severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and
 crumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come
 centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud “i
 am here!”
 
before i left the castle i so fixed its entrances that never more can
 the count enter there un-dead.
 
when i stepped into the circle where madam mina slept, she woke from her
 sleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that i had endured too much.
 
“come!” she said, “come away from this awful place! let us go to meet my
 husband who is, i know, coming towards us.” she was looking thin and
 pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. i was
 glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the
 fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.
 
and so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet
 our friends--and _him_--whom madam mina tell that she _know_ are
 coming to meet us.
 

_mina harker’s journal._
 
_6 november._--it was late in the afternoon when the professor and i
 took our way towards the east whence i knew jonathan was coming. we did
 not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take
 heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being
 left without warmth in the cold and the snow. we had to take some of our
 provisions, too, for we were in perfect desolation, and, so far as we
 could see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of
 habitation. when we had gone about mile, i was tired with the heavy
 walking and sat down to rest. then we looked back and saw where the
 clear line of dracula’s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under
 the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the
 carpathian mountains was far below it. we saw it in all its grandeur,
 perched thousand feet on the summit of sheer precipice, and with
 seemingly great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain
 on any side. there was something wild and uncanny about the place. we
 could hear the distant howling of wolves. they were far off, but the
 sound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was
 full of terror. i knew from the way dr. helsing was searching about
 that was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less
 exposed in case of attack. the rough roadway still led downwards; we
 could trace it through the drifted snow.
 
in little while the professor signalled to me, so i got up and joined
 him. had found wonderful spot, sort of natural hollow in rock,
 with an entrance like doorway between two boulders. took by the
 hand and drew in: “see!” said, “here you will be in shelter; and
 if the wolves do come i can meet them one by one.” brought in our
 furs, and made snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and
 forced them upon me. but i could not eat; to even try to do so was
 repulsive to me, and, much as i would have liked to please him, i could
 not bring myself to the attempt. looked very sad, but did not
 reproach me. taking his field-glasses from the case, stood on the top
 of the rock, and began to search the horizon. suddenly called out:--
 
“look! madam mina, look! look!” i sprang up and stood beside him on the
 rock; handed his glasses and pointed. the snow was now falling
 more heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for high wind was beginning
 to blow. however, there were times when there were pauses between the
 snow flurries and i could see long way round. from the height where we
 were it was possible to see great distance; and far off, beyond the
 white waste of snow, i could see the river lying like black ribbon in
 kinks and curls as it wound its way. straight in front of us and not far
 off--in fact, so near that i wondered we had not noticed before--came a
 group of mounted men hurrying along. in the midst of them was cart, a
 long leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like dog’s tail
 wagging, with each stern inequality of the road. outlined against the
 snow as they were, i could see from the men’s clothes that they were
 peasants or gypsies of some kind.
 
on the cart was great square chest. my heart leaped as i saw it, for i
 felt that the end was coming. the evening was now drawing close, and
 well i knew that at sunset the thing, which was till then imprisoned
 there, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all
 pursuit. in fear i turned to the professor; to my consternation,
 however, was not there. an instant later, i saw him below me. round
 the rock had drawn circle, such as we had found shelter in last
 night. when had completed it stood beside again, saying:--
 
“at least you shall be safe here from _him_!” took the glasses from
 me, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.
 “see,” said, “they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and
 galloping as hard as they can.” paused and went on in hollow
 voice:--
 
“they are racing for the sunset. we may be too late. god’s will be
 done!” down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole
 landscape was blotted out. it soon passed, however, and once more his
 glasses were fixed on the plain. then came sudden cry:--
 
“look! look! look! see, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the
 south. it must be quincey and john. take the glass. look before the snow
 blots it all out!” i took it and looked. the two men might be dr. seward
 and mr. morris. i knew at all events that neither of them was jonathan.
 at the same time i _knew_ that jonathan was not far off; looking around
 i saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at
 break-neck speed. one of them i knew was jonathan, and the other i took,
 of course, to be lord godalming. they, too, were pursuing the party with
 the cart. when i told the professor shouted in glee like schoolboy,
 and, after looking intently till snow fall made sight impossible, he
 laid his winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the
 opening of our shelter. “they are all converging,” said. “when the
 time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.” i got out my revolver
 ready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came
 louder and closer. when the snow storm abated moment we looked again.
 it was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,
 and beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down
 towards the far mountain tops. sweeping the glass all around us i could
 see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger
 numbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.
 
every instant seemed an age whilst we waited. the wind came now in
 fierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in
 circling eddies. at times we could not see an arm’s length before us;
 but at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to
 clear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. we had of
 late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew
 with fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the
 sun would set. it was hard to believe that by our watches it was less
 than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various
 bodies began to converge close upon us. the wind came now with fiercer
 and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. it seemingly
 had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,
 the snow fell. we could distinguish clearly the individuals of each
 party, the pursued and the pursuers. strangely enough those pursued did
 not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they
 seemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower
 and lower on the mountain tops.
 
closer and closer they drew. the professor and i crouched down behind
 our rock, and held our weapons ready; i could see that was determined
 that they should not pass. one and all were quite unaware of our
 presence.
 
all at once two voices shouted out to: “halt!” one was my jonathan’s,
 raised in high key of passion; the other mr. morris’ strong resolute
 tone of quiet command. the gypsies may not have known the language, but
 there was mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were
 spoken. instinctively they reined in, and at the instant lord godalming
 and jonathan dashed up at one side and dr. seward and mr. morris on the
 other. the leader of the gypsies, splendid-looking fellow who sat his
 horse like centaur, waved them back, and in fierce voice gave to his
 companions some word to proceed. they lashed the horses which sprang
 forward; but the four men raised their winchester rifles, and in an
 unmistakable way commanded them to stop. at the same moment dr. van
 helsing and i rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.
 seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew
 up. the leader turned to them and gave word at which every man of the
 gypsy party drew what weapon carried, knife or pistol, and held
 himself in readiness to attack. issue was joined in an instant.
 
the leader, with quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in
 front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill
 tops--and then to the castle, said something which i did not understand.
 for answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses
 and dashed towards the cart. i should have felt terrible fear at seeing
 jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been
 upon as well as the rest of them; i felt fear, but only wild,
 surging desire to do something. seeing the quick movement of our
 parties, the leader of the gypsies gave command; his men instantly
 formed round the cart in sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one
 shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the
 order.
 
in the midst of this i could see that jonathan on one side of the ring
 of men, and quincey on the other, were forcing way to the cart; it was
 evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun
 should set. nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. neither the
 levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor
 the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their
 attention. jonathan’s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his
 purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they
 cowered, aside and let him pass. in an instant had jumped upon the
 cart, and, with strength which seemed incredible, raised the great
 box, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. in the meantime, mr.
 morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of
 szgany. all the time i had been breathlessly watching jonathan i had,
 with the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had
 seen the knives of the gypsies flash as won way through them, and
 they cut at him. had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first
 i thought that too had come through in safety; but as sprang
 beside jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, i could see that
 with his left hand was clutching at his side, and that the blood was
 spurting through his fingers. did not delay notwithstanding this, for
 as jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,
 attempting to prize off the lid with his great kukri knife, attacked
 the other frantically with his bowie. under the efforts of both men the
 lid began to yield; the nails drew with quick screeching sound, and
 the top of the box was thrown back.
 
by this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the winchesters,
 and at the mercy of lord godalming and dr. seward, had given in and made
 resistance. the sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the
 shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. i saw the count
 lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from
 the cart had scattered over him. was deathly pale, just like waxen
 image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which i
 knew too well.
 
as i looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them
 turned to triumph.
 
but, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of jonathan’s great knife.
 i shrieked as i saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same
 moment mr. morris’s bowie knife plunged into the heart.
 
it was like miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the
 drawing of breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from
 our sight.
 
i shall be glad as long as i live that even in that moment of final
 dissolution, there was in the face look of peace, such as i never
 could have imagined might have rested there.
 
the castle of dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone
 of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the
 setting sun.
 
the gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary
 disappearance of the dead man, turned, without word, and rode away as
 if for their lives. those who were unmounted jumped upon the
 leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. the wolves,
 which had withdrawn to safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving
 us alone.
 
mr. morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his
 hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. i
 flew to him, for the holy circle did not now keep back; so did the
 two doctors. jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his
 head on his shoulder. with sigh took, with feeble effort, my hand
 in that of his own which was unstained. must have seen the anguish of
 my heart in my face, for smiled at and said:--
 
“i am only too happy to have been of any service! oh, god!” cried
 suddenly, struggling up to sitting posture and pointing to me, “it was
 worth for this to die! look! look!”
 
the sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams
 fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. with one impulse
 the men sank on their knees and deep and earnest “amen” broke from all
 as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. the dying man
 spoke:--
 
“now god be thanked that all has not been in vain! see! the snow is not
 more stainless than her forehead! the curse has passed away!”
 
and, to our bitter grief, with smile and in silence, died, a
 gallant gentleman.
 



note
 

seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of
 some of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. it
 is an added joy to mina and to that our boy’s birthday is the same
 day as that on which quincey morris died. his mother holds, i know, the
 secret belief that some of our brave friend’s spirit has passed into
 him. his bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but
 we call him quincey.
 
in the summer of this year we made journey to transylvania, and went
 over the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and
 terrible memories. it was almost impossible to believe that the things
 which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were
 living truths. every trace of all that had been was blotted out. the
 castle stood as before, reared high above waste of desolation.
 
when we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all
 look back on without despair, for godalming and seward are both happily
 married. i took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since
 our return so long ago. we were struck with the fact, that in all the
 mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one
 authentic document; nothing but mass of typewriting, except the later
 note-books of mina and seward and myself, and helsing’s memorandum.
 we could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as
 proofs of so wild story. helsing summed it all up as said, with
 our boy on his knee:--
 
“we want proofs; we ask none to believe us! this boy will some day
 know what brave and gallant woman his mother is. already knows her
 sweetness and loving care; later on will understand how some men so
 loved her, that they did dare much for her sake.”

 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
 states. compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements. we do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. to send
 donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
 visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.
