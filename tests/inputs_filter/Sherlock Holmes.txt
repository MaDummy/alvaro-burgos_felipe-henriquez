“and mademoiselle’s address?” asked.
 
“is briony lodge, serpentine avenue, st. john’s wood.”
 
holmes took note it. “one question,” said he. “was the

“it was.”

stout gentleman half rose chair gave bob of
 greeting, quick little questioning glance small
 fat-encircled eyes.
 
“try settee,” said holmes, relapsing armchair putting
 fingertips together, custom judicial moods. “i

“your cases indeed greatest interest me,” i
 observed.
 
“you will remember remarked day, just went

“a proposition took liberty doubting.”
 
“you did, doctor, none less must come round view, for

“my dear fellow,” said sherlock holmes sat either side the

“and yet convinced it,” answered. “the cases come
 light papers are, rule, bald enough, vulgar enough.
 police reports realism pushed extreme limits, and
 yet result is, must confessed, neither fascinating nor
 artistic.”
 
“a certain selection discretion must used producing a
 realistic effect,” remarked holmes. “this wanting police

 magistrate upon details, observer contain the
 vital essence whole matter. depend upon it, nothing so
 unnatural commonplace.”
 
smiled shook head. “i can quite understand thinking so,”
 said. “of course, position unofficial adviser helper

 gazing dull neutral-tinted london street. looking over
 shoulder, saw pavement opposite stood large
 woman heavy fur boa round neck, large curling red
 feather broad-brimmed hat tilted coquettish duchess
 devonshire fashion ear. great panoply she
 peeped nervous, hesitating fashion windows, her
 body oscillated backward forward, fingers fidgeted her
 glove buttons. suddenly, plunge, swimmer leaves
 bank, hurried across road, heard sharp clang of
 bell.
 
“i seen symptoms before,” said holmes, throwing his
 cigarette fire. “oscillation upon pavement always means an

 matter delicate communication. yet even may
 discriminate. woman seriously wronged man no

 small black figure like full-sailed merchant-man behind tiny
 pilot boat. sherlock holmes welcomed easy courtesy for

 armchair, looked minute yet abstracted
 fashion peculiar him.
 
“do find,” said, “that short sight little
 trying much typewriting?”
 
“i first,” answered, “but now know letters are
 without looking.” then, suddenly realising full purport his
 words, gave violent start looked up, fear and
 astonishment upon broad, good-humoured face. “you’ve heard about
 me, mr. holmes,” cried, “else know that?”
 
“never mind,” said holmes, laughing; “it business know things.
 perhaps trained see others overlook. not, why
 come consult me?”
 
“i came you, sir, heard mrs. etherege, whose
 husband found easy police everyone given up
 dead. oh, mr. holmes, wish much me. i’m not
 rich, still hundred year right, besides the
 little make machine, give know what
 become mr. hosmer angel.”
 
“why come away consult hurry?” asked sherlock
 holmes, finger-tips together eyes ceiling.
 
startled look came somewhat vacuous face miss mary
 sutherland. “yes, bang house,” said, “for made
 angry see easy way mr. windibank—that is, my
 father—took all. go police, go
 you, last, nothing kept saying that
 harm done, made mad, just things
 came right away you.”
 
“your father,” said holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since name is
 different.”
 
“yes, stepfather. call father, though sounds funny, too,
 five years two months older myself.”
 
“and mother alive?”
 
“oh, yes, mother alive well. wasn’t best pleased, mr. holmes,
 married soon father’s death, man was
 nearly fifteen years younger herself. father plumber the
 tottenham court road, left tidy business behind him, which
 mother carried mr. hardy, foreman; mr. windibank
 came made sell business, superior, a
 traveller wines. got £ 4700 goodwill interest,
 wasn’t near much father got been
 alive.”
 
expected see sherlock holmes impatient rambling and
 inconsequential narrative, but, contrary, listened with
 greatest concentration attention.
 
“your little income,” asked, “does come business?”
 
“oh, no, sir. quite separate left uncle ned in
 auckland. new zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. two thousand
 five hundred pounds amount, can touch interest.”
 
“you interest extremely,” said holmes. “and since draw large
 sum hundred year, earn bargain, no
 doubt travel little indulge every way. believe that
 single lady can get nicely upon income £ 60.”
 
“i much less that, mr. holmes, understand

 use money just staying them. of
 course, just time. mr. windibank draws interest
 every quarter pays mother, find can do
 pretty well earn typewriting. brings twopence a

“you made position clear me,” said holmes. “this is
 friend, dr. watson, can speak freely before
 myself. kindly tell us now connection mr. hosmer
 angel.”
 
flush stole miss sutherland’s face, picked nervously at
 fringe jacket. “i met first gasfitters’ ball,”
 said. “they used send father tickets alive, then
 afterwards remembered us, sent mother. mr. windibank
 wish us go. never wish us go anywhere. would
 get quite mad wanted much join sunday-school treat. but
 time set going, go; right to
 prevent? said folk fit us know, all
 father’s friends there. said nothing fit
 wear, purple plush never much taken
 drawer. last, nothing else do, went to
 france upon business firm, went, mother i, with
 mr. hardy, used foreman, met mr.
 hosmer angel.”
 
“i suppose,” said holmes, “that mr. windibank came back from
 france annoyed gone ball.”
 
“oh, well, good it. laughed, remember, and
 shrugged shoulders, said use denying anything a
 woman, way.”
 
“i see. gasfitters’ ball met, understand, a
 gentleman called mr. hosmer angel.”
 
“yes, sir. met night, called next day ask we
 got home safe, met him—that say, mr.
 holmes, met twice walks, father came back
 again, mr. hosmer angel come house more.”
 
“no?”
 
“well, know father didn’t like anything sort. wouldn’t
 visitors help it, used say woman

 mother, woman wants circle begin with, got

“but mr. hosmer angel? make attempt see you?”
 
“well, father going france week, hosmer wrote

“were engaged gentleman time?”
 
“oh, yes, mr. holmes. engaged first walk we
 took. hosmer—mr. angel—was cashier office leadenhall

“what office?”
 
“that’s worst it, mr. holmes, don’t know.”
 
“where live, then?”
 
“he slept premises.”
 
“and don’t know address?”
 
“no—except leadenhall street.”
 
“where address letters, then?”
 
“to leadenhall street post office, left till called for. he
 said sent office chaffed all
 clerks letters lady, offered to
 typewrite them, like his, wouldn’t that, said
 wrote seemed come me, were
 typewritten always felt machine come us. that
 will just show fond me, mr. holmes, little
 things think of.”
 
“it suggestive,” said holmes. “it long axiom of
 mine little things infinitely important. can you
 remember little things mr. hosmer angel?”
 
“he shy man, mr. holmes. rather walk the
 evening daylight, said hated be
 conspicuous. retiring gentlemanly was. even voice was
 gentle. he’d quinsy swollen glands young, he
 told me, left weak throat, hesitating,
 whispering fashion speech. always well dressed, neat and
 plain, eyes weak, just mine are, wore tinted
 glasses glare.”
 
“well, happened mr. windibank, stepfather, returned
 france?”
 
“mr. hosmer angel came house proposed should
 marry father came back. dreadful earnest made me
 swear, hands testament, whatever happened would
 always true him. mother said quite right make swear,
 sign passion. mother favour

 talked marrying within week, began ask father; but
 said never mind father, just tell him

“it missed him, then?”
 
“yes, sir; started england just arrived.”
 
“ha! unfortunate. wedding arranged, then, the

“yes, sir, quietly. st. saviour’s, near king’s

“it seems shamefully treated,” said
 holmes.
 
“oh, no, sir! good kind leave so. why, the
 morning saying that, whatever happened, true;
 even something quite unforeseen occurred separate us, i
 always remember pledged him, would
 claim pledge sooner later. seemed strange talk a
 wedding-morning, happened since gives meaning it.”
 
“most certainly does. opinion is, then, some
 unforeseen catastrophe occurred him?”
 
“yes, sir. believe foresaw danger, else not
 talked so. think foresaw happened.”
 
“but notion been?”
 
“none.”
 
“one question. mother take matter?”
 
“she angry, said never speak matter

“and father? tell him?”
 
“yes; seemed think, me, something happened, and

“then don’t think i’ll see again?”
 
“i fear not.”
 
“then happened him?”
 
“you will leave question hands. like accurate

“i advertised last saturday’s _chronicle_,” said she. “here

“thank you. address?”
 
“no. 31 lyon place, camberwell.”
 
“mr. angel’s address never had, understand. your
