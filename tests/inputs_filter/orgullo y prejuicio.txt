_walt whitman has somewhere fine and just distinction between “loving
 by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” this distinction applies
 to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
 numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it
 brings curious consequence with it. there is much more difference as
 to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by
 allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and
 proper thing to love them. and in the sect--fairly large and yet
 unusually choice--of austenians or janites, there would probably be
 found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the
 novels. to some the delightful freshness and humour of_ northanger
 abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted
 critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
 of burlesque or parody, kind in which the first rank is reached with
 difficulty._ persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
 in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite
 delicacy and keeping. the catastrophe of_ mansfield park _is admittedly
 theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost
 wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that
 edmund only took fanny because mary shocked him, and that fanny might
 very likely have taken crawford if had been little more assiduous;
 yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of mrs. norris and
 others have secured, i believe, considerable party for it._ sense and
 sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
 not want them._
 
_i suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes
 would, all things considered, be divided between_ emma _and the present
 book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed fondness for miss
 austen be not of itself patent of exemption from any possible charge
 of vulgarity) would go for_ emma. _it is the larger, the more varied, the
 more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather
 more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most
 peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as miss bates, as the
 eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. on the other hand,
 i, for my part, declare for_ pride and prejudice _unhesitatingly. it
 seems to the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most
 eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention
 in such narrow space as is permitted to me, i propose here to show
 cause._
 
_in the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the
 reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,
 when miss austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and
 finished at chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till
 1813, only four years before her death. i do not know whether, in this
 combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the
 critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct
 superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it
 possesses over all the others. the plot, though not elaborate, is almost
 regular enough for fielding; hardly character, hardly an incident
 could be retrenched without loss to the story. the elopement of lydia
 and wickham is not, like that of crawford and mrs. rushworth, a_ coup de
 théâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the
 story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.
 all the minor passages--the loves of jane and bingley, the advent of mr.
 collins, the visit to hunsford, the derbyshire tour--fit in after the
 same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. there is attempt at the
 hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between
 frank churchill and jane fairfax contributes doubt good deal to the
 intrigue of_ emma, _but contributes it in fashion which i do not think
 the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. although miss austen
 always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her
 opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to
 be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly
 natural occasions provided by the false account of darcy’s conduct given
 by wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from
 the gradual transformation of elizabeth’s own feelings from positive
 aversion to actual love. i do not know whether the all-grasping hand of
 the playwright has ever been laid upon_ pride and prejudice; _and i dare
 say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or
 garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and
 delicate for pit and gallery. but if the attempt were made, it would
 certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,
 which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can
 avail himself, appear at once on the stage._
 
_i think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to
 more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest
 merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. it sets off his other gifts
 and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it
 will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite
 consciously--to eyes by means ultra-critical. but very badly-built
 novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which
 displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all
 faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than faultless plot
 acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. and despite the
 ability which miss austen has shown in working out the story, i for one
 should put_ pride and prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what
 seem to the very masterpieces of miss austen’s humour and of her
 faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit john
 thorpe, the eltons, mrs. norris, and one or two others to their company,
 but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still
 superior to them._
 
_the characteristics of miss austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate
 that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to
 express, and at any particular time likely to be differently
 apprehended by different persons. to this humour seems to possess a
 greater affinity, on the whole, to that of addison than to any other of
 the numerous species of this great british genus. the differences of
 scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,
 obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,
 for there was distinctly feminine element in “mr. spectator,” and in
 jane austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was
 masculine. but the likeness of quality consists in great number of
 common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,
 avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. also there is in both a
 certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. it is the custom with those
 who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of addison with the
 savagery of swift, the mildness of miss austen with the boisterousness
 of fielding and smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that
 her immediate predecessor, miss burney, allowed without very much
 protest. yet, both in mr. addison and in miss austen there is, though a
 restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in
 roasting and cutting up fool. man in the early eighteenth century,
 of course, could push this taste further than lady in the early
 nineteenth; and doubt miss austen’s principles, as well as her heart,
 would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate
 husband in the_ spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the
 innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play
 at blind-man’s-buff. but another_ spectator _letter--that of the damsel
 of fourteen who wishes to marry mr. shapely, and assures her selected
 mentor that “he admires your_ spectators _mightily”--might have been
 written by rather more ladylike and intelligent lydia bennet in the
 days of lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (i
 think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of miss austen’s
 own, such as her satire of mrs. musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over
 her son. but this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the
 english language, especially when, by glaring and gratuitous
 falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and
 snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. if cynicism means
 the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells
 beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and
 that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then
 every man and woman who is not fool, who does not care to live in a
 fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is
 cynic. and in that sense miss austen certainly was one. she may even
 have been one in the further sense that, like her own mr. bennet, she
 took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at
 work her fools and her mean persons. i think she did take this delight,
 and i do not think at all the worse of her for it as woman, while she
 was immensely the better for it as an artist._
 
_in respect of her art generally, mr. goldwin smith has truly observed
 that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,
 combined with the narrowness of her field;” and has justly added that
 we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of miniature
 painter. to make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the
 term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of memling
 at one end of the history of painting and meissonier at the other, than
 of cosway or any of his kind. and i am not so certain that i should
 myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. if her world is a
 microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the
 littleness. she does not touch what she did not feel herself called to
 paint; i am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not
 feel herself called to touch. it is at least remarkable that in two very
 short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not
 much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a
 single failure. it is possible that the romantic paste in her
 composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly
 anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century
 seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. even scott
 required hill and mountain and ballad, even coleridge metaphysics and
 german to enable them to chip the classical shell. miss austen was an
 english girl, brought up in country retirement, at the time when
 ladies went back into the house if there was white frost which might
 pierce their kid shoes, when sudden cold was the subject of the
 gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were
 subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which
 mary wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular
 taste or judgment. miss austen, too, drew back when the white frost
 touched her shoes; but i think she would have made pretty good journey
 even in black one._
 
_for if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which
 only genius knows. the one was humanity, and the other was art. on the
 first head she could not make mistake; her men, though limited, are
 true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” as to art, if she
 has never tried idealism, her realism is real to degree which makes
 the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. take almost any
 frenchman, except the late m. maupassant, and watch him laboriously
 piling up strokes in the hope of giving complete impression. you get
 none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what gives, you can
 shape real impression out of the rest. but with miss austen the
 myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.
 nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. when (to take the present book
 only) mr. collins changed his mind from jane to elizabeth “while mrs.
 bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _mrs. bennet would have
 stirred the fire), when mr. darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_
 himself,” _the touch in each case is like that of swift--“taller by the
 breadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant thackeray with
 just and outspoken admiration. indeed, fantastic as it may seem, i
 should put miss austen as near to swift in some ways, as i have put her
 to addison in others._
 
_this swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears
 nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable mr.
 collins. mr. collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything addison
 ever did, almost great enough for fielding or for swift himself. it has
 been said that one ever was like him. but in the first place,_ he
 _was like him; is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds
 of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and
 distinguished philosophers.” in the second place, it is rash, i think,
 to conclude that an actual mr. collins was impossible or non-existent at
 the end of the eighteenth century. it is very interesting that we
 possess, in this same gallery, what may be called spoiled first
 draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in john dashwood. the
 formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait
 is only half alive, and is felt to be even little unnatural. mr.
 collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. in fact, for all the
 “miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which certain
 side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century
 humanity, its philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,
 its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,
 its selfishness, receives exhibition. i will not admit that one speech
 or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled
 with reality, and i should not wonder if many of these words and actions
 are historically true._
 
_but the greatness of mr. collins could not have been so satisfactorily
 exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the
 figures of mr. bennet and of lady catherine bourgh. the latter, like
 mr. collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. there is,
 perhaps, very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me
 very faint indeed. even now i do not think that it would be impossible
 to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble
 birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,
 as lady catherine. hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the lady
 powerful (if not exactly bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,
 rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of
 developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present
 themselves now. as for mr. bennet, miss austen, and mr. darcy, and even
 miss elizabeth herself, were, i am inclined to think, rather hard on him
 for the “impropriety” of his conduct. his wife was evidently, and must
 always have been, quite irreclaimable fool; and unless had shot her
 or himself there was way out of it for man of sense and spirit but
 the ironic. from other point of view is open to any reproach,
 except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of
 the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the
 consciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that
 even miss austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. it is
 difficult to know whether is most agreeable when talking to his wife,
 or when putting mr. collins through his paces; but the general sense of
 the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his
 consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “my dear,
 do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. let us hope for better things.
 let us flatter ourselves that_ i _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry
 to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which mr. collins has just
 related as made by himself to lady catherine, “may i ask whether these
 pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the
 result of previous study?” these are the things which give miss austen’s
 readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by
 the readers of swift, of fielding, and we may here add, of thackeray, as
 they are felt by the readers of other english author of fiction
 outside of these four._
 
_the goodness of the minor characters in_ pride and prejudice _has been
 already alluded to, and it makes detailed dwelling on their beauties
 difficult in any space, and impossible in this. mrs. bennet we have
 glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely
 amusing or more horribly true. much the same may be said of kitty and
 lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have
 differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and
 vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common
 weaknesses of woman at such different ages. with mary, miss austen has
 taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;
 not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting
 traditional appendices which mr. austen leigh has given us, in dooming
 her privately to marry “one of mr. philips’s clerks.” the habits of
 first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and
 singing too long in public, are, doubt, grievous and criminal; but
 perhaps poor mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings
 in that fordyce-belectured generation. it is at any rate difficult not
 to extend to her share of the respect and affection (affection and
 respect of peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards mr.
 collins, when she draws the moral of lydia’s fall. i sometimes wish
 that the exigencies of the story had permitted miss austen to unite
 these personages, and thus at once achieve notable mating and soothe
 poor mrs. bennet’s anguish over the entail._
 
_the bingleys and the gardiners and the lucases, miss darcy and miss de
 bourgh, jane, wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,
 further than the remark that charlotte lucas (her egregious papa, though
 delightful, is just little on the thither side of the line between
 comedy and farce) is wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and
 that wickham (though something of miss austen’s hesitation of touch in
 dealing with young men appears) is not much less notable sketch in
 drab of another. only genius could have made charlotte what she is, yet
 not disagreeable; wickham what is, without investing him either with
 cheap don juanish attractiveness or disgusting rascality. but the
 hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._
 
_darcy has always seemed to by far the best and most interesting of
 miss austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being henry tilney,
 whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into
 comparison. it has sometimes, i believe, been urged that his pride is
 unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while
 his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. here again i
 cannot go with the objectors. darcy’s own account of the way in which
 his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and
 nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its
 sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of elizabeth’s
 scornful refusal acting on nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. nothing in
 even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of
 his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of pemberley. had he
 been bad prig or bad coxcomb, might have been still smarting
 under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come
 husband-hunting. his being neither is exactly consistent with the
 probable feelings of man spoilt in the common sense, but not really
 injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. as for his being in
 love, elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that
 phenomenon as darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,
 only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal
 charm._
 
_the secret of that charm many men and not few women, from miss austen
 herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is thing rather
 to be felt than to be explained. elizabeth of course belongs to the_
 allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of venus. miss austen was
 always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and
 except the fine eyes, and hint or two that she had at any rate
 sometimes bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing
 about her looks. but her chief difference from other heroines of the
 lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost
 strong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and
 secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her
 propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. elizabeth can give
 at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never
 “scratches,” and she never attacks first. some of the merest
 obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early
 speeches slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to
 serious business, as in the great proposal scene with darcy (which is,
 as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the
 final ladies’ battle with lady catherine, she is unexceptionable. then
 too she is perfectly natural girl. she does not disguise from herself
 or anybody that she resents darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with
 as personal feeling. (by the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of
 this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same
 kind, expressed doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have
 been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons
 who ought to have been worse bred than darcy.) and she lets the
 injury done to jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family
 aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._
 
_still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a
 common form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her
 playfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a
 certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.
 nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent
 darcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the
 idea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating wickham.
 elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the
 “new woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)
 women have by education and experience, perfect freedom from the idea
 that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with
 her if they can. though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”
 she has mere sensibility, nasty niceness about her. the form of
 passion common and likely to seem natural in miss austen’s day was so
 invariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of
 these qualities, that she has not made elizabeth outwardly passionate.
 but i, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have
 married darcy just as willingly without pemberley as with it, and
 anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’
 conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked
 to the della cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the della
 cruscans of this._
 
_and, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of
 charm?--it is there. there were better sense in the sad mechanic
 exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. in
 the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young
 ladies with whom it might be pleasure to fall in love; there are at
 least five with whom, as it seems to me, man of taste and spirit can
 help doing so. their names are, in chronological order, elizabeth
 bennet, diana vernon, argemone lavington, beatrix esmond, and barbara
 grant. i should have been most in love with beatrix and argemone; i
 should, i think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred diana
 and barbara. but to live with and to marry, i do not know that any one
 of the four can come into competition with elizabeth._

chapter i.]
 

it is truth universally acknowledged, that single man in possession
 of good fortune must be in want of wife.
 
however little known the feelings or views of such man may be on his
 first entering neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
 of the surrounding families, that is considered as the rightful
 property of some one or other of their daughters.
 
“my dear mr. bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
 netherfield park is let at last?”
 
mr. bennet replied that had not.
 
“but it is,” returned she; “for mrs. long has just been here, and she
 told all about it.”
 
mr. bennet made answer.
 
“do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.
 
“_you_ want to tell me, and i have objection to hearing it.”
 
[illustration:
 
“he came down to see the place”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
this was invitation enough.
 
“why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is taken
 by young man of large fortune from the north of england; that came
 down on monday in chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
 delighted with it that agreed with mr. morris immediately; that is
 to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
 in the house by the end of next week.”
 
“what is his name?”
 
“bingley.”
 
“is married or single?”
 
“oh, single, my dear, to be sure! single man of large fortune; four or
 five thousand year. what fine thing for our girls!”
 
“how so? how can it affect them?”
 
“my dear mr. bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? you
 must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them.”
 
“is that his design in settling here?”
 
“design? nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he
 _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
 soon as comes.”
 
“i see occasion for that. you and the girls may go--or you may send
 them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are
 as handsome as any of them, mr. bingley might like you the best of the
 party.”
 
“my dear, you flatter me. i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
 i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. when woman has five
 grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”
 
“in such cases, woman has not often much beauty to think of.”
 
“but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when comes into
 the neighbourhood.”
 
“it is more than i engage for, i assure you.”
 
“but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it would
 be for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are determined to go,
 merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit new
 comers. indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
 him, if you do not.”
 
“you are over scrupulous, surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be very
 glad to see you; and i will send few lines by you to assure him of my
 hearty consent to his marrying whichever chooses of the girls--though
 i must throw in good word for my little lizzy.”
 
“i desire you will do such thing. lizzy is not bit better than the
 others: and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so
 good-humoured as lydia. but you are always giving _her_ the preference.”
 
“they have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are
 all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of
 quickness than her sisters.”
 
“mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such way? you take
 delight in vexing me. you have compassion on my poor nerves.”
 
“you mistake me, my dear. i have high respect for your nerves. they
 are my old friends. i have heard you mention them with consideration
 these twenty years at least.”
 
“ah, you do not know what i suffer.”
 
“but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
 thousand year come into the neighbourhood.”
 
“it will be use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
 visit them.”
 
“depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them
 all.”
 
mr. bennet was so odd mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
 reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
 been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _her_ mind
 was less difficult to develope. she was woman of mean understanding,
 little information, and uncertain temper. when she was discontented, she
 fancied herself nervous. the business of her life was to get her
 daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.

chapter ii.
 

[illustration]
 
mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley. he
 had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
 wife that should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
 paid she had knowledge of it. it was then disclosed in the following
 manner. observing his second daughter employed in trimming hat, he
 suddenly addressed her with,--
 
“i hope mr. bingley will like it, lizzy.”
 
“we are not in way to know _what_ mr. bingley likes,” said her mother,
 resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”
 
“but you forget, mamma,” said elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
 assemblies, and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him.”
 
“i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing. she has two nieces
 of her own. she is selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have opinion
 of her.”
 
“no more have i,” said mr. bennet; “and i am glad to find that you do
 not depend on her serving you.”
 
mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain
 herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
 
“don’t keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven’s sake! have little
 compassion on my nerves. you tear them to pieces.”
 
“kitty has discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
 them ill.”
 
“i do not cough for my own amusement,” replied kitty, fretfully. “when
 is your next ball to be, lizzy?”
 
“to-morrow fortnight.”
 
“ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and mrs. long does not come back till
 the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for
 she will not know him herself.”
 
“then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
 mr. bingley to _her_.”
 
“impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him
 myself; how can you be so teasing?”
 
“i honour your circumspection. fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly
 very little. one cannot know what man really is by the end of a
 fortnight. but if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
 all, mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,
 as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i
 will take it on myself.”
 
the girls stared at their father. mrs. bennet said only, “nonsense,
 nonsense!”
 
“what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “do
 you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
 them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you _there_. what say you,
 mary? for you are young lady of deep reflection, i know, and read
 great books, and make extracts.”
 
mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.
 
“while mary is adjusting her ideas,” continued, “let us return to mr.
 bingley.”
 
“i am sick of mr. bingley,” cried his wife.
 
“i am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell so before? if i
 had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on
 him. it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we
 cannot escape the acquaintance now.”
 
the astonishment of the ladies was just what wished--that of mrs.
 bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
 was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
 while.
 
“how good it was in you, my dear mr. bennet! but i knew i should
 persuade you at last. i was sure you loved your girls too well to
 neglect such an acquaintance. well, how pleased i am! and it is such a
 good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a
 word about it till now.”
 
“now, kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said mr. bennet; and,
 as spoke, left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
 
“what an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was
 shut. “i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
 or either, for that matter. at our time of life, it is not so
 pleasant, i can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
 for your sakes we would do anything. lydia, my love, though you _are_
 the youngest, i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next
 ball.”
 
“oh,” said lydia, stoutly, “i am not afraid; for though i _am_ the
 youngest, i’m the tallest.”
 
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon would
 return mr. bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
 dinner.

chapter iii.

not all that mrs. bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
 daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
 husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley. they attacked him
 in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
 distant surmises; but eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
 last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
 lady lucas. her report was highly favourable. sir william had been
 delighted with him. was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
 agreeable, and, to crown the whole, meant to be at the next assembly
 with large party. nothing could be more delightful! to be fond of
 dancing was certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
 hopes of mr. bingley’s heart were entertained.
 
“if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield,”
 said mrs. bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
 married, i shall have nothing to wish for.”
 
in few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet’s visit, and sat about ten
 minutes with him in his library. had entertained hopes of being
 admitted to sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty had heard
 much; but saw only the father. the ladies were somewhat more
 fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper
 window, that wore blue coat and rode black horse.
 
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had
 mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
 housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. mr. bingley
 was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
 accept the honour of their invitation, etc. mrs. bennet was quite
 disconcerted. she could not imagine what business could have in town
 so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
 might always be flying about from one place to another, and never
 settled at netherfield as ought to be. lady lucas quieted her fears a
 little by starting the idea of his
 
[illustration:
 
“when the party entered”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
being gone to london only to get large party for the ball; and a
 report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and
 seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. the girls grieved over such a
 number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing
 that, instead of twelve, had brought only six with him from london,
 his five sisters and cousin. and when the party entered the
 assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: mr. bingley, his
 two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.
 
mr. bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: had pleasant
 countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. his sisters were fine women,
 with an air of decided fashion. his brother-in-law, mr. hurst, merely
 looked the gentleman; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention
 of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
 the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after
 his entrance, of his having ten thousand year. the gentlemen
 pronounced him to be fine figure of man, the ladies declared was
 much handsomer than mr. bingley, and was looked at with great
 admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave disgust
 which turned the tide of his popularity; for was discovered to be
 proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
 large estate in derbyshire could save him from having most forbidding,
 disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his
 friend.
 
mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
 people in the room: was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
 was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
 himself at netherfield. such amiable qualities must speak for
 themselves. what contrast between him and his friend! mr. darcy danced
 only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being
 introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
 walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
 his character was decided. was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
 the world, and everybody hoped that would never come there again.
 amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet, whose dislike of
 his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
 having slighted one of her daughters.
 
elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
 down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr. darcy had been
 standing near enough for her to overhear conversation between him and
 mr. bingley, who came from the dance for few minutes to press his
 friend to join it.
 
“come, darcy,” said he, “i must have you dance. i hate to see you
 standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. you had much better
 dance.”
 
“i certainly shall not. you know how i detest it, unless i am
 particularly acquainted with my partner. at such an assembly as this, it
 would be insupportable. your sisters are engaged, and there is not
 another woman in the room whom it would not be punishment to to
 stand up with.”
 
“i would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried bingley, “for a
 kingdom! upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my
 life as i have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,
 uncommonly pretty.”
 
“_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said mr.
 darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.
 
“oh, she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one
 of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i
 dare say very agreeable. do let ask my partner to introduce you.”
 
[illustration:
 
“she is tolerable”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“which do you mean?” and turning round, looked for moment at
 elizabeth, till, catching her eye, withdrew his own, and coldly said,
 “she is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and i am in no
 humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
 by other men. you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
 smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”
 
mr. bingley followed his advice. mr. darcy walked off; and elizabeth
 remained with very cordial feelings towards him. she told the story,
 however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had lively,
 playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
 
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. mrs.
 bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
 party. mr. bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
 distinguished by his sisters. jane was as much gratified by this as her
 mother could be, though in quieter way. elizabeth felt jane’s
 pleasure. mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
 accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been
 fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
 had yet learnt to care for at ball. they returned, therefore, in good
 spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
 were the principal inhabitants. they found mr. bennet still up. with a
 book, was regardless of time; and on the present occasion had a
 good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
 such splendid expectations. had rather hoped that all his wife’s
 views on the stranger would be disappointed; but soon found that he
 had very different story to hear.
 
“oh, my dear mr. bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had most
 delightful evening, most excellent ball. i wish you had been there.
 jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. everybody said how well
 she looked; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
 her twice. only think of _that_, my dear: actually danced with her
 twice; and she was the only creature in the room that asked second
 time. first of all, asked miss lucas. i was so vexed to see him stand
 up with her; but, however, did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
 can, you know; and seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
 down the dance. so inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
 asked her for the two next. then, the two third danced with miss
 king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane
 again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the _boulanger_----”
 
“if had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,
 “he would not have danced half so much! for god’s sake, say more of
 his partners. that had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”
 
“oh, my dear,” continued mrs. bennet, “i am quite delighted with him. he
 is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. i never
 in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. i dare say the
 lace upon mrs. hurst’s gown----”
 
here she was interrupted again. mr. bennet protested against any
 description of finery. she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
 of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some
 exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy.
 
“but i can assure you,” she added, “that lizzy does not lose much by not
 suiting _his_ fancy; for is most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
 all worth pleasing. so high and so conceited, that there was enduring
 him! walked here, and walked there, fancying himself so very
 great! not handsome enough to dance with! i wish you had been there, my
 dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. i quite detest the man.”

chapter iv.
 

[illustration]
 
when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
 her praise of mr. bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
 she admired him.
 
“he is just what young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
 good-humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners! so much ease,
 with such perfect good breeding!”
 
“he is also handsome,” replied elizabeth, “which young man ought
 likewise to be if possibly can. his character is thereby complete.”
 
“i was very much flattered by his asking to dance second time. i
 did not expect such compliment.”
 
“did not you? _i_ did for you. but that is one great difference between
 us. compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. what
 could be more natural than his asking you again? could not help
 seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
 the room. thanks to his gallantry for that. well, certainly is
 very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him. you have liked many a
 stupider person.”
 
“dear lizzy!”
 
“oh, you are great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
 you never see fault in anybody. all the world are good and agreeable
 in your eyes. i never heard you speak ill of human being in my life.”
 
“i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but i always speak
 what i think.”
 
“i know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. with _your_
 good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
 others! affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it
 everywhere. but to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the
 good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing
 of the bad,--belongs to you alone. and so, you like this man’s sisters,
 too, do you? their manners are not equal to his.”
 
“certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you
 converse with them. miss bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
 his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find very charming
 neighbour in her.”
 
elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at
 the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
 quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
 with judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was
 very little disposed to approve them. they were, in fact, very fine
 ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the
 power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.
 they were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private
 seminaries in town; had fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the
 habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
 of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of
 themselves and meanly of others. they were of respectable family in
 the north of england; circumstance more deeply impressed on their
 memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been
 acquired by trade.
 
mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly hundred
 thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
 but did not live to do it. mr. bingley intended it likewise, and
 sometimes made choice of his county; but, as was now provided with a
 good house and the liberty of manor, it was doubtful to many of those
 who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether might not spend the
 remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to
 purchase.
 
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
 though was now established only as tenant, miss bingley was by no
 means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was mrs. hurst, who had
 married man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
 his house as her home when it suited her. mr. bingley had not been of
 age two years when was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to
 look at netherfield house. did look at it, and into it, for half an
 hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
 with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.
 
between him and darcy there was very steady friendship, in spite of a
 great opposition of character. bingley was endeared to darcy by the
 easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though disposition
 could offer greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
 never appeared dissatisfied. on the strength of darcy’s regard, bingley
 had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. in
 understanding, darcy was the superior. bingley was by means
 deficient; but darcy was clever. was at the same time haughty,
 reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not
 inviting. in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. bingley
 was sure of being liked wherever appeared; darcy was continually
 giving offence.
 
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
 characteristic. bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
 girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;
 there had been formality, stiffness; had soon felt acquainted
 with all the room; and as to miss bennet, could not conceive an angel
 more beautiful. darcy, on the contrary, had seen collection of people
 in whom there was little beauty and fashion, for none of whom had
 felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
 pleasure. miss bennet acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too
 much.
 
mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired
 her and liked her, and pronounced her to be sweet girl, and one whom
 they should not object to know more of. miss bennet was therefore
 established as sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such
 commendation to think of her as chose.

chapter v.
 

[illustration]
 
within short walk of longbourn lived family with whom the bennets
 were particularly intimate. sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
 in meryton, where had made tolerable fortune, and risen to the
 honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. the
 distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. it had given him a
 disgust to his business and to his residence in small market town;
 and, quitting them both, had removed with his family to house about
 mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge; where he
 could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by
 business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. for,
 though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
 contrary, was all attention to everybody. by nature inoffensive,
 friendly, and obliging, his presentation at st. james’s had made him
 courteous.
 
lady lucas was very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
 valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet. they had several children. the eldest
 of them, sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
 elizabeth’s intimate friend.
 
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a
 ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
 brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.
 
“_you_ began the evening well, charlotte,” said mrs. bennet, with civil
 self-command, to miss lucas. “_you_ were mr. bingley’s first choice.”
 
“yes; but seemed to like his second better.”
 
“oh, you mean jane, i suppose, because danced with her twice. to be
 sure that _did_ seem as if admired her--indeed, i rather believe he
 _did_--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something
 about mr. robinson.”
 
“perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson: did not
 i mention it to you? mr. robinson’s asking him how liked our meryton
 assemblies, and whether did not think there were great many pretty
 women in the room, and _which_ thought the prettiest? and his
 answering immediately to the last question, ‘oh, the eldest miss bennet,
 beyond doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”
 
“upon my word! well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as
 if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”
 
“_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, eliza,” said
 charlotte. “mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
 is he? poor eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”
 
“i beg you will not put it into lizzy’s head to be vexed by his
 ill-treatment, for is such disagreeable man that it would be quite
 misfortune to be liked by him. mrs. long told last night that he
 sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”
 
[illustration: “without once opening his lips”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“are you quite sure, ma’am? is not there little mistake?” said jane.
 “i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her.”
 
“ay, because she asked him at last how liked netherfield, and he
 could not help answering her; but she said seemed very angry at being
 spoke to.”
 
“miss bingley told me,” said jane, “that never speaks much unless
 among his intimate acquaintance. with _them_ is remarkably
 agreeable.”
 
“i do not believe word of it, my dear. if had been so very
 agreeable, would have talked to mrs. long. but i can guess how it
 was; everybody says that is eat up with pride, and i dare say had
 heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep carriage, and had to come
 to the ball in hack chaise.”
 
“i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long,” said miss lucas, “but i
 wish had danced with eliza.”
 
“another time, lizzy,” said her mother, “i would not dance with _him_,
 if i were you.”
 
“i believe, ma’am, i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”
 
“his pride,” said miss lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride
 often does, because there is an excuse for it. one cannot wonder that so
 very fine young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
 should think highly of himself. if i may so express it, has _right_
 to be proud.”
 
“that is very true,” replied elizabeth, “and i could easily forgive
 _his_ pride, if had not mortified _mine_.”
 
“pride,” observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
 reflections, “is very common failing, i believe. by all that i have
 ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
 nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
 who do not cherish feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
 quality or other, real or imaginary. vanity and pride are different
 things, though the words are often used synonymously. person may be
 proud without being vain. pride relates more to our opinion of
 ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”
 
“if i were as rich as mr. darcy,” cried young lucas, who came with his
 sisters, “i should not care how proud i was. i would keep pack of
 foxhounds, and drink bottle of wine every day.”
 
“then you would drink great deal more than you ought,” said mrs.
 bennet; “and if i were to see you at it, i should take away your bottle
 directly.”
 
the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
 would; and the argument ended only with the visit.

chapter vi.

the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. the visit
 was returned in due form. miss bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the
 good-will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was
 found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
 wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the
 two eldest. by jane this attention was received with the greatest
 pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
 everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
 though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had value, as arising,
 in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. it
 was generally evident, whenever they met, that _did_ admire her; and
 to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
 which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
 way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
 was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane
 united with great strength of feeling, composure of temper and an
 uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
 suspicions of the impertinent. she mentioned this to her friend, miss
 lucas.
 
“it may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied charlotte, “to be able to impose
 on the public in such case; but it is sometimes disadvantage to be
 so very guarded. if woman conceals her affection with the same skill
 from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
 it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
 dark. there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
 attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. we can all
 _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
 very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
 encouragement. in nine cases out of ten, woman had better show _more_
 affection than she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
 may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”
 
“but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. if _i_ can
 perceive her regard for him, must be simpleton indeed not to
 discover it too.”
 
“remember, eliza, that does not know jane’s disposition as you do.”
 
“but if woman is partial to man, and does not endeavor to conceal
 it, must find it out.”
 
“perhaps must, if sees enough of her. but though bingley and jane
 meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
 always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
 every moment should be employed in conversing together. jane should
 therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
 attention. when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
 in love as much as she chooses.”
 
“your plan is good one,” replied elizabeth, “where nothing is in
 question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined
 to get rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it. but
 these are not jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. as yet she
 cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
 reasonableness. she has known him only fortnight. she danced four
 dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
 and has since dined in company with him four times. this is not quite
 enough to make her understand his character.”
 
“not as you represent it. had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
 only have discovered whether had good appetite; but you must
 remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
 evenings may do great deal.”
 
“yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
 like vingt-un better than commerce, but with respect to any other
 leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”
 
“well,” said charlotte, “i wish jane success with all my heart; and if
 she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a
 chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
 twelvemonth. happiness in marriage is entirely matter of chance. if
 the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
 ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
 least. they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
 have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
 possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
 life.”
 
“you make laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound. you know it is not
 sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”
 
occupied in observing mr. bingley’s attention to her sister, elizabeth
 was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
 interest in the eyes of his friend. mr. darcy had at first scarcely
 allowed her to be pretty: had looked at her without admiration at the
 ball; and when they next met, looked at her only to criticise. but no
 sooner had made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
 hardly good feature in her face, than began to find it was rendered
 uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. to
 this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. though had
 detected with critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
 in her form, was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
 pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
 of the fashionable world, was caught by their easy playfulness. of
 this she was perfectly unaware: to her was only the man who made
 himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
 to dance with.
 
began to wish to know more of her; and, as step towards conversing
 with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. his doing so
 drew her notice. it was at sir william lucas’s, where large party were
 assembled.
 
“what does mr. darcy mean,” said she to charlotte, “by listening to my
 conversation with colonel forster?”
 
“that is question which mr. darcy only can answer.”
 
“but if does it any more, i shall certainly let him know that i see
 what is about. has very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by
 being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him.”
 
[illustration: “the entreaties of several” [_copyright 1894 by george
 allen._]]
 
on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
 any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
 subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she
 turned to him and said,--
 
“did not you think, mr. darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well
 just now, when i was teasing colonel forster to give us ball at
 meryton?”
 
“with great energy; but it is subject which always makes lady
 energetic.”
 
“you are severe on us.”
 
“it will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said miss lucas. “i am going
 to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows.”
 
“you are very strange creature by way of friend!--always wanting me
 to play and sing before anybody and everybody! if my vanity had taken a
 musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, i would
 really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
 hearing the very best performers.” on miss lucas’s persevering, however,
 she added, “very well; if it must be so, it must.” and gravely glancing
 at mr. darcy, “there is very fine old saying, which everybody here is
 of course familiar with--‘keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and
 i shall keep mine to swell my song.”
 
her performance was pleasing, though by means capital. after song
 or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
 would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
 sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
 the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
 impatient for display.
 
mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
 application, it had given her likewise pedantic air and conceited
 manner, which would have injured higher degree of excellence than she
 had reached. elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
 much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the
 end of long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
 scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
 some of the lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
 dancing at one end of the room.
 
mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such mode of
 passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
 much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas
 was his neighbour, till sir william thus began:--
 
“what charming amusement for young people this is, mr. darcy! there is
 nothing like dancing, after all. i consider it as one of the first
 refinements of polished societies.”
 
“certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
 the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”
 
sir william only smiled. “your friend performs delightfully,” he
 continued, after pause, on seeing bingley join the group; “and i doubt
 not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr. darcy.”
 
“you saw dance at meryton, i believe, sir.”
 
“yes, indeed, and received inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. do
 you often dance at st. james’s?”
 
“never, sir.”
 
“do you not think it would be proper compliment to the place?”
 
“it is compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it.”
 
“you have house in town, i conclude?”
 
mr. darcy bowed.
 
“i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for i am fond of
 superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
 london would agree with lady lucas.”
 
paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to
 make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, was
 struck with the notion of doing very gallant thing, and called out to
 her,--
 
“my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing? mr. darcy, you must allow
 to present this young lady to you as very desirable partner. you
 cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”
 and, taking her hand, would have given it to mr. darcy, who, though
 extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
 drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william,--
 
“indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing. i entreat you
 not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for partner.”
 
mr. darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
 her hand, but in vain. elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at
 all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
 
“you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
 the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
 amusement in general, can have objection, i am sure, to oblige us
 for one half hour.”
 
“mr. darcy is all politeness,” said elizabeth, smiling.
 
“he is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we
 cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
 partner?”
 
elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. her resistance had not injured
 her with the gentleman, and was thinking of her with some
 complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley,--
 
“i can guess the subject of your reverie.”
 
“i should imagine not.”
 
“you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
 evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, i am quite of
 your opinion. i was never more annoyed! the insipidity, and yet the
 noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these
 people! what would i give to hear your strictures on them!”
 
“your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you. my mind was more
 agreeably engaged. i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
 which pair of fine eyes in the face of pretty woman can bestow.”
 
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
 would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
 mr. darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--
 
“miss elizabeth bennet.”
 
“miss elizabeth bennet!” repeated miss bingley. “i am all astonishment.
 how long has she been such favourite? and pray when am i to wish you
 joy?”
 
“that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask. lady’s
 imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
 to matrimony, in moment. i knew you would be wishing joy.”
 
“nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as
 absolutely settled. you will have charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
 of course she will be always at pemberley with you.”
 
listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
 entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
 that all was safe, her wit flowed along.

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 



chapter vii.
 

[illustration]
 
mr. bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
 thousand year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
 in default of heirs male, on distant relation; and their mother’s
 fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
 the deficiency of his. her father had been an attorney in meryton, and
 had left her four thousand pounds.
 
she had sister married to mr. philips, who had been clerk to their
 father and succeeded him in the business, and brother settled in
 london in respectable line of trade.
 
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; most
 convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
 thither three or four times week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and
 to milliner’s shop just over the way. the two youngest of the family,
 catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:
 their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing
 better offered, walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
 hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of
 news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn
 some from their aunt. at present, indeed, they were well supplied both
 with news and happiness by the recent arrival of militia regiment in
 the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was
 the head-quarters.
 
their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting
 intelligence. every day added something to their knowledge of the
 officers’ names and connections. their lodgings were not long secret,
 and at length they began to know the officers themselves. mr. philips
 visited them all, and this opened to his nieces source of felicity
 unknown before. they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr.
 bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
 mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
 an ensign.
 
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr.
 bennet coolly observed,--
 
“from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
 of the silliest girls in the country. i have suspected it some time, but
 i am now convinced.”
 
catherine was disconcerted, and made answer; but lydia, with perfect
 indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and
 her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as was going the
 next morning to london.
 
“i am astonished, my dear,” said mrs. bennet, “that you should be so
 ready to think your own children silly. if i wished to think slightingly
 of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”
 
“if my children are silly, i must hope to be always sensible of it.”
 
“yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”
 
“this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree. i
 had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must
 so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
 foolish.”
 
“my dear mr. bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
 their father and mother. when they get to our age, i dare say they will
 not think about officers any more than we do. i remember the time when i
 liked red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so i do still at my
 heart; and if smart young colonel, with five or six thousand year,
 should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought
 colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william’s in
 his regimentals.”
 
“mamma,” cried lydia, “my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
 carter do not go so often to miss watson’s as they did when they first
 came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke’s library.”
 
mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
 note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited
 for an answer. mrs. bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
 eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--
 
“well, jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does say? well,
 jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”
 
“it is from miss bingley,” said jane, and then read it aloud.
 
/* nind “my dear friend, */
 
“if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and
 me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
 lives; for whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never
 end without quarrel. come as soon as you can on the receipt of
 this. my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
 yours ever,
 
“caroline bingley.”
 
“with the officers!” cried lydia: “i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
 _that_.”
 
“dining out,” said mrs. bennet; “that is very unlucky.”
 
“can i have the carriage?” said jane.
 
“no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
 rain; and then you must stay all night.”
 
“that would be good scheme,” said elizabeth, “if you were sure that
 they would not offer to send her home.”
 
“oh, but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley’s chaise to go to meryton;
 and the hursts have horses to theirs.”
 
“i had much rather go in the coach.”
 
“but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure. they are
 wanted in the farm, mr. bennet, are not they?”
 
[illustration: cheerful prognostics]
 
“they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them.”
 
“but if you have got them to-day,” said elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose
 will be answered.”
 
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
 were engaged; jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
 mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of bad
 day. her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it
 rained hard. her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
 delighted. the rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
 jane certainly could not come back.
 
“this was lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said mrs. bennet, more than
 once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. till the next
 morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
 contrivance. breakfast was scarcely over when servant from netherfield
 brought the following note for elizabeth:--
 
/* nind “my dearest lizzie, */
 
“i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be
 imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. my kind friends will
 not hear of my returning home till i am better. they insist also on
 my seeing mr. jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
 of his having been to me--and, excepting sore throat and a
 headache, there is not much the matter with me.
 
“yours, etc.”
 
“well, my dear,” said mr. bennet, when elizabeth had read the note
 aloud, “if your daughter should have dangerous fit of illness--if she
 should die--it would be comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
 mr. bingley, and under your orders.”
 
“oh, i am not at all afraid of her dying. people do not die of little
 trifling colds. she will be taken good care of. as long as she stays
 there, it is all very well. i would go and see her if i could have the
 carriage.”
 
elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the
 carriage was not to be had: and as she was horsewoman, walking was
 her only alternative. she declared her resolution.
 
“how can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
 thing, in all this dirt! you will not be fit to be seen when you get
 there.”
 
“i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want.”
 
“is this hint to me, lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
 horses?”
 
“no, indeed. i do not wish to avoid the walk. the distance is nothing,
 when one has motive; only three miles. i shall be back by dinner.”
 
“i admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed mary, “but every
 impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
 exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”
 
“we will go as far as meryton with you,” said catherine and lydia.
 elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
 together.
 
“if we make haste,” said lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
 see something of captain carter, before goes.”
 
in meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
 of the officers’ wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
 field after field at quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
 over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
 within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and face
 glowing with the warmth of exercise.
 
she was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but jane were
 assembled, and where her appearance created great deal of surprise.
 that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
 dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and
 miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
 for it. she was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
 brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was
 good-humour and kindness. mr. darcy said very little, and mr. hurst
 nothing at all. the former was divided between admiration of the
 brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to
 the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. the latter was
 thinking only of his breakfast.
 
her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. miss
 bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
 enough to leave her room. elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
 immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
 alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
 for such visit, was delighted at her entrance. she was not equal,
 however, to much conversation; and when miss bingley left them together,
 could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
 extraordinary kindness she was treated with. elizabeth silently attended
 her.
 
when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth
 began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
 solicitude they showed for jane. the apothecary came; and having
 examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
 violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
 advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. the advice
 was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
 ached acutely. elizabeth did not quit her room for moment, nor were
 the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
 nothing to do elsewhere.
 
when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
 unwillingly said so. miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
 wanted little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern
 at parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
 of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the
 present. elizabeth most thankfully consented, and servant was
 despatched to longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
 back supply of clothes.

chapter viii.
 

[illustration]
 
at five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
 elizabeth was summoned to dinner. to the civil inquiries which then
 poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
 much superior solicitude of mr. bingley, she could not make very
 favourable answer. jane was by means better. the sisters, on hearing
 this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
 shocking it was to have bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
 being ill themselves; and then thought more of the matter: and their
 indifference towards jane, when not immediately before them, restored
 elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.
 
their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
 regard with any complacency. his anxiety for jane was evident, and his
 attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling
 herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
 others. she had very little notice from any but him. miss bingley was
 engrossed by mr. darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr.
 hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, was an indolent man, who lived only to
 eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when found her prefer plain
 dish to ragout, had nothing to say to her.
 
when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley
 began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. her manners were
 pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:
 she had conversation, style, taste, beauty. mrs. hurst
 thought the same, and added,--
 
“she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
 walker. i shall never forget her appearance this morning. she really
 looked almost wild.”
 
“she did indeed, louisa. i could hardly keep my countenance. very
 nonsensical to come at all! why must _she_ be scampering about the
 country, because her sister had cold? her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”
 
“yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
 in mud, i am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to
 hide it not doing its office.”
 
“your picture may be very exact, louisa,” said bingley; “but this was
 all lost upon me. i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well
 when she came into the room this morning. her dirty petticoat quite
 escaped my notice.”
 
“_you_ observed it, mr. darcy, i am sure,” said miss bingley; “and i am
 inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
 an exhibition.”
 
“certainly not.”
 
“to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
 above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
 it? it seems to to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
 most country-town indifference to decorum.”
 
“it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
 bingley.
 
“i am afraid, mr. darcy,” observed miss bingley, in half whisper,
 “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
 eyes.”
 
“not at all,” replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” a
 short pause followed this speech, and mrs. hurst began again,--
 
“i have an excessive regard for jane bennet,--she is really very sweet
 girl,--and i wish with all my heart she were well settled. but with such
 father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no
 chance of it.”
 
“i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
 meryton?”
 
“yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside.”
 
“that is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.
 
“if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside,” cried bingley, “it
 would not make them one jot less agreeable.”
 
“but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
 consideration in the world,” replied darcy.
 
to this speech bingley made answer; but his sisters gave it their
 hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
 their dear friend’s vulgar relations.
 
with renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
 leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
 she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
 late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
 when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
 down stairs herself. on entering the drawing-room, she found the whole
 party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
 them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the
 excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay
 below, with book. mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment.
 
“do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”
 
“miss eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, “despises cards. she is great
 reader, and has pleasure in anything else.”
 
“i deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried elizabeth; “i
 am _not_ great reader, and i have pleasure in many things.”
 
“in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure,” said bingley; “and
 i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”
 
elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards table
 where few books were lying. immediately offered to fetch her
 others; all that his library afforded.
 
“and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
 credit; but i am an idle fellow; and though i have not many, i have more
 than i ever looked into.”
 
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
 in the room.
 
“i am astonished,” said miss bingley, “that my father should have left
 so small collection of books. what delightful library you have at
 pemberley, mr. darcy!”
 
“it ought to be good,” replied: “it has been the work of many
 generations.”
 
“and then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying
 books.”
 
“i cannot comprehend the neglect of family library in such days as
 these.”
 
“neglect! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
 that noble place. charles, when you build _your_ house, i wish it may be
 half as delightful as pemberley.”
 
“i wish it may.”
 
“but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
 neighbourhood, and take pemberley for kind of model. there is not a
 finer county in england than derbyshire.”
 
“with all my heart: i will buy pemberley itself, if darcy will sell it.”
 
“i am talking of possibilities, charles.”
 
“upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get
 pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”
 
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
 attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
 the card-table, and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest
 sister, to observe the game.
 
“is miss darcy much grown since the spring?” said miss bingley: “will
 she be as tall as i am?”
 
“i think she will. she is now about miss elizabeth bennet’s height, or
 rather taller.”
 
“how i long to see her again! i never met with anybody who delighted me
 so much. such countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished
 for her age! her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”
 
“it is amazing to me,” said bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
 to be so very accomplished as they all are.”
 
“all young ladies accomplished! my dear charles, what do you mean?”
 
“yes, all of them, i think. they all paint tables, cover screens, and
 net purses. i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and i am
 sure i never heard young lady spoken of for the first time, without
 being informed that she was very accomplished.”
 
“your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said darcy, “has
 too much truth. the word is applied to many woman who deserves it no
 otherwise than by netting purse or covering screen; but i am very
 far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. i
 cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my
 acquaintance that are really accomplished.”
 
“nor i, i am sure,” said miss bingley.
 
“then,” observed elizabeth, “you must comprehend great deal in your
 idea of an accomplished woman.”
 
“yes; i do comprehend great deal in it.”
 
“oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
 esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
 with. woman must have thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
 dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all
 this, she must possess certain something in her air and manner of
 walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
 will be but half deserved.”
 
“all this she must possess,” added darcy; “and to all she must yet add
 something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive
 reading.”
 
“i am longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
 i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”
 
“are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
 this?”
 
“_i_ never saw such woman. _i_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
 application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”
 
mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
 implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
 answered this description, when mr. hurst called them to order, with
 bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. as all
 conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the
 room.
 
“eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is
 one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
 sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i daresay, it
 succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is paltry device, very mean art.”
 
“undoubtedly,” replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
 “there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
 to employ for captivation. whatever bears affinity to cunning is
 despicable.”
 
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
 continue the subject.
 
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
 that she could not leave her. bingley urged mr. jones’s being sent for
 immediately; while his sisters, convinced that country advice could
 be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
 eminent physicians. this she would not hear of; but she was not so
 unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled
 that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet
 were not decidedly better. bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
 declared that they were miserable. they solaced their wretchedness,
 however, by duets after supper; while could find better relief to
 his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
 possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.

chapter ix.

elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the
 morning had the pleasure of being able to send tolerable answer to the
 inquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by housemaid,
 and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
 sisters. in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
 note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her
 own judgment of her situation. the note was immediately despatched, and
 its contents as quickly complied with. mrs. bennet, accompanied by her
 two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
 
had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs. bennet would have been
 very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
 not alarming, she had wish of her recovering immediately, as her
 restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. she
 would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried
 home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
 it at all advisable. after sitting little while with jane, on miss
 bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
 attended her into the breakfast parlour. bingley met them with hopes
 that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.
 
“indeed i have, sir,” was her answer. “she is great deal too ill to be
 moved. mr. jones says we must not think of moving her. we must trespass
 little longer on your kindness.”
 
“removed!” cried bingley. “it must not be thought of. my sister, i am
 sure, will not hear of her removal.”
 
“you may depend upon it, madam,” said miss bingley, with cold civility,
 “that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
 remains with us.”
 
mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
 
“i am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, i do not
 know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
 vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
 always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
 temper i ever met with. i often tell my other girls they are nothing to
 _her_. you have sweet room here, mr. bingley, and charming prospect
 over that gravel walk. i do not know place in the country that is
 equal to netherfield. you will not think of quitting it in hurry, i
 hope, though you have but short lease.”
 
“whatever i do is done in hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if i
 should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five
 minutes. at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here.”
 
“that is exactly what i should have supposed of you,” said elizabeth.
 
“you begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.
 
“oh yes--i understand you perfectly.”
 
“i wish i might take this for compliment; but to be so easily seen
 through, i am afraid, is pitiful.”
 
“that is as it happens. it does not necessarily follow that deep,
 intricate character is more or less estimable than such one as yours.”
 
“lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
 the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”
 
“i did not know before,” continued bingley, immediately, “that you were
 studier of character. it must be an amusing study.”
 
“yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. they have at
 least that advantage.”
 
“the country,” said darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for
 such study. in country neighbourhood you move in very confined and
 unvarying society.”
 
“but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
 observed in them for ever.”
 
“yes, indeed,” cried mrs. bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
 country neighbourhood. “i assure you there is quite as much of _that_
 going on in the country as in town.”
 
everybody was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for moment,
 turned silently away. mrs. bennet, who fancied she had gained complete
 victory over him, continued her triumph,--
 
“i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country, for
 my part, except the shops and public places. the country is vast deal
 pleasanter, is not it, mr. bingley?”
 
“when i am in the country,” replied, “i never wish to leave it; and
 when i am in town, it is pretty much the same. they have each their
 advantages, and i can be equally happy in either.”
 
“ay, that is because you have the right disposition. but that
 gentleman,” looking at darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
 at all.”
 
“indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said elizabeth, blushing for her
 mother. “you quite mistook mr. darcy. only meant that there was not
 such variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
 you must acknowledge to be true.”
 
“certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
 many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few
 neighbourhoods larger. i know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”
 
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
 countenance. his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
 mr. darcy with very expressive smile. elizabeth, for the sake of
 saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if
 charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away.
 
“yes, she called yesterday with her father. what an agreeable man sir
 william is, mr. bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so
 genteel and so easy! has always something to say to everybody. _that_
 is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
 important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”
 
“did charlotte dine with you?”
 
“no, she would go home. i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. for
 my part, mr. bingley, _i_ always keep servants that can do their own
 work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. but everybody is to
 judge for themselves, and the lucases are very good sort of girls, i
 assure you. it is pity they are not handsome! not that _i_ think
 charlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”
 
“she seems very pleasant young woman,” said bingley.
 
“oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. lady lucas herself
 has often said so, and envied jane’s beauty. i do not like to boast
 of my own child; but to be sure, jane--one does not often see anybody
 better looking. it is what everybody says. i do not trust my own
 partiality. when she was only fifteen there was gentleman at my
 brother gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my
 sister-in-law was sure would make her an offer before we came away.
 but, however, did not. perhaps thought her too young. however, he
 wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”
 
“and so ended his affection,” said elizabeth, impatiently. “there has
 been many one, i fancy, overcome in the same way. i wonder who first
 discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”
 
“i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said darcy.
 
“of fine, stout, healthy love it may. everything nourishes what is
 strong already. but if it be only slight, thin sort of inclination, i
 am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”
 
darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
 tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. she longed to
 speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after short silence mrs.
 bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to
 jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy. mr. bingley was
 unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
 civil also, and say what the occasion required. she performed her part,
 indeed, without much graciousness, but mrs. bennet was satisfied, and
 soon afterwards ordered her carriage. upon this signal, the youngest of
 her daughters put herself forward. the two girls had been whispering to
 each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the
 youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming
 into the country to give ball at netherfield.
 
lydia was stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with fine complexion
 and good-humoured countenance; favourite with her mother, whose
 affection had brought her into public at an early age. she had high
 animal spirits, and sort of natural self-consequence, which the
 attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her
 own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. she was
 very equal, therefore, to address mr. bingley on the subject of the
 ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be
 the most shameful thing in the world if did not keep it. his answer
 to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.
 
“i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when
 your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
 the ball. but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”
 
lydia declared herself satisfied. “oh yes--it would be much better to
 wait till jane was well; and by that time, most likely, captain carter
 would be at meryton again. and when you have given _your_ ball,” she
 added, “i shall insist on their giving one also. i shall tell colonel
 forster it will be quite shame if does not.”
 
mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned
 instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the
 remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy; the latter of whom, however,
 could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
 all miss bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.

chapter x.

the day passed much as the day before had done. mrs. hurst and miss
 bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
 continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, elizabeth joined
 their party in the drawing-room. the loo table, however, did not appear.
 mr. darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching
 the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
 messages to his sister. mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet, and
 mrs. hurst was observing their game.
 
elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
 attending to what passed between darcy and his companion. the perpetual
 commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
 of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
 with which her praises were received, formed curious dialogue, and was
 exactly in unison with her opinion of each.
 
“how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such letter!”
 
made answer.
 
“you write uncommonly fast.”
 
“you are mistaken. i write rather slowly.”
 
“how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
 year! letters of business, too! how odious i should think them!”
 
“it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”
 
“pray tell your sister that i long to see her.”
 
“i have already told her so once, by your desire.”
 
“i am afraid you do not like your pen. let mend it for you. i mend
 pens remarkably well.”
 
“thank you--but i always mend my own.”
 
“how can you contrive to write so even?”
 
was silent.
 
“tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
 and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
 little design for table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss
 grantley’s.”
 
“will you give leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at
 present i have not room to do them justice.”
 
“oh, it is of consequence. i shall see her in january. but do you
 always write such charming long letters to her, mr. darcy?”
 
“they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
 to determine.”
 
“it is rule with me, that person who can write long letter with
 ease cannot write ill.”
 
“that will not do for compliment to darcy, caroline,” cried her
 brother, “because does _not_ write with ease. studies too much
 for words of four syllables. do not you, darcy?”
 
“my style of writing is very different from yours.”
 
“oh,” cried miss bingley, “charles writes in the most careless way
 imaginable. leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”
 
“my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them; by which
 means my letters sometimes convey ideas at all to my correspondents.”
 
“your humility, mr. bingley,” said elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”
 
“nothing is more deceitful,” said darcy, “than the appearance of
 humility. it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
 indirect boast.”
 
“and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”
 
“the indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
 writing, because you consider them as proceeding from rapidity of
 thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
 think at least highly interesting. the power of doing anything with
 quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
 attention to the imperfection of the performance. when you told mrs.
 bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield
 you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be sort of
 panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very
 laudable in precipitance which must leave very necessary business
 undone, and can be of real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”
 
“nay,” cried bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
 foolish things that were said in the morning. and yet, upon my honour, i
 believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this
 moment. at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless
 precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”
 
“i daresay you believed it; but i am by means convinced that you
 would be gone with such celerity. your conduct would be quite as
 dependent on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were
 mounting your horse, friend were to say, ‘bingley, you had better stay
 till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not
 go--and, at another word, might stay month.”
 
“you have only proved by this,” cried elizabeth, “that mr. bingley did
 not do justice to his own disposition. you have shown him off now much
 more than did himself.”
 
“i am exceedingly gratified,” said bingley, “by your converting what my
 friend says into compliment on the sweetness of my temper. but i am
 afraid you are giving it turn which that gentleman did by means
 intend; for would certainly think the better of if, under such a
 circumstance, i were to give flat denial, and ride off as fast as i
 could.”
 
“would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
 as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”
 
“upon my word, i cannot exactly explain the matter--darcy must speak for
 himself.”
 
“you expect to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
 but which i have never acknowledged. allowing the case, however, to
 stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet,
 that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
 the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
 one argument in favour of its propriety.”
 
“to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of friend is merit
 with you.”
 
“to yield without conviction is compliment to the understanding of
 either.”
 
“you appear to me, mr. darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
 friendship and affection. regard for the requester would often make
 one readily yield to request, without waiting for arguments to reason
 one into it. i am not particularly speaking of such case as you have
 supposed about mr. bingley. we may as well wait, perhaps, till the
 circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
 thereupon. but in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,
 where one of them is desired by the other to change resolution of no
 very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
 with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”
 
“will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
 with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
 appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
 between the parties?”
 
“by all means,” cried bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
 forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more
 weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of. i assure
 you that if darcy were not such great tall fellow, in comparison with
 myself, i should not pay him half so much deference. i declare i do not
 know more awful object than darcy on particular occasions, and in
 particular places; at his own house especially, and of sunday evening,
 when has nothing to do.”
 
mr. darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that was
 rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. miss bingley warmly
 resented the indignity had received, in an expostulation with her
 brother for talking such nonsense.
 
“i see your design, bingley,” said his friend. “you dislike an argument,
 and want to silence this.”
 
“perhaps i do. arguments are too much like disputes. if you and miss
 bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very
 thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”
 
“what you ask,” said elizabeth, “is sacrifice on my side; and mr.
 darcy had much better finish his letter.”
 
mr. darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
 
when that business was over, applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
 for the indulgence of some music. miss bingley moved with alacrity to
 the pianoforte, and after polite request that elizabeth would lead the
 way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
 seated herself.
 
mrs. hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,
 elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
 that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr. darcy’s eyes were fixed
 on her. she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
 admiration to so great man, and yet that should look at her because
 disliked her was still more strange. she could only imagine, however,
 at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her
 more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
 any other person present. the supposition did not pain her. she liked
 him too little to care for his approbation.
 
after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a
 lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr. darcy, drawing near
 elizabeth, said to her,--
 
“do you not feel great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an
 opportunity of dancing reel?”
 
she smiled, but made answer. repeated the question, with some
 surprise at her silence.
 
“oh,” said she, “i heard you before; but i could not immediately
 determine what to say in reply. you wanted me, i know, to say ‘yes,’
 that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always
 delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating person of
 their premeditated contempt. i have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
 you that i do not want to dance reel at all; and now despise if you
 dare.”
 
“indeed i do not dare.”
 
elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
 gallantry; but there was mixture of sweetness and archness in her
 manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and darcy had
 never been so bewitched by any woman as was by her. really
 believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
 should be in some danger.
 
miss bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great
 anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some
 assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.
 
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
 their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
 
“i hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
 next day, “you will give your mother-in-law few hints, when this
 desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
 and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after
 the officers. and, if i may mention so delicate subject, endeavour to
 check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
 which your lady possesses.”
 
[illustration:
 
“no, no; stay where you are”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”
 
“oh yes. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed
 in the gallery at pemberley. put them next to your great-uncle the
 judge. they are in the same profession, you know, only in different
 lines. as for your elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it
 taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”
 
“it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their
 colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
 copied.”
 
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurst and
 elizabeth herself.
 
“i did not know that you intended to walk,” said miss bingley, in some
 confusion, lest they had been overheard.
 
“you used us abominably ill,” answered mrs. hurst, “running away without
 telling us that you were coming out.”
 
then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy, she left elizabeth to walk
 by herself. the path just admitted three. mr. darcy felt their rudeness,
 and immediately said,--
 
“this walk is not wide enough for our party. we had better go into the
 avenue.”
 
but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
 laughingly answered,--
 
“no, no; stay where you are. you are charmingly grouped, and appear to
 uncommon advantage. the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
 fourth. good-bye.”
 
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of
 being at home again in day or two. jane was already so much recovered
 as to intend leaving her room for couple of hours that evening.

“piling up the fire”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 



chapter xi.
 

[illustration]
 
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister, and
 seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,
 where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of
 pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were
 during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. their powers
 of conversation were considerable. they could describe an entertainment
 with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their
 acquaintance with spirit.
 
but when the gentlemen entered, jane was longer the first object;
 miss bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had
 something to say to him before had advanced many steps. addressed
 himself directly to miss bennet with polite congratulation; mr. hurst
 also made her slight bow, and said was “very glad;” but diffuseness
 and warmth remained for bingley’s salutation. was full of joy and
 attention. the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
 should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,
 to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the
 door. then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
 elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
 delight.
 
when tea was over mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
 card-table--but in vain. she had obtained private intelligence that mr.
 darcy did not wish for cards, and mr. hurst soon found even his open
 petition rejected. she assured him that one intended to play, and the
 silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. mr.
 hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
 sofas and go to sleep. darcy took up book. miss bingley did the same;
 and mrs. hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
 rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with miss
 bennet.
 
miss bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr.
 darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
 perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. she
 could not win him, however, to any conversation; merely answered her
 question and read on. at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
 amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
 second volume of his, she gave great yawn and said, “how pleasant it
 is to spend an evening in this way! i declare, after all, there is no
 enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tires of anything than of a
 book! when i have house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not
 an excellent library.”
 
one made any reply. she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
 cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing
 her brother mentioning ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly
 towards him and said,--
 
“by the bye charles, are you really serious in meditating dance at
 netherfield? i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
 the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not
 some among us to whom ball would be rather punishment than a
 pleasure.”
 
“if you mean darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he
 chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite settled
 thing, and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send
 round my cards.”
 
“i should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were
 carried on in different manner; but there is something insufferably
 tedious in the usual process of such meeting. it would surely be much
 more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
 day.”
 
“much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say; but it would not be
 near so much like ball.”
 
miss bingley made answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about
 the room. her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but darcy, at
 whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. in the
 desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,
 turning to elizabeth, said,--
 
“miss eliza bennet, let persuade you to follow my example, and take a
 turn about the room. i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
 long in one attitude.”
 
elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. miss bingley
 succeeded less in the real object of her civility: mr. darcy looked
 up. was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
 elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. was
 directly invited to join their party, but declined it, observing that
 could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
 the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
 interfere. what could mean? she was dying to know what could be his
 meaning--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.
 
“not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, means to be
 severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
 nothing about it.”
 
miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in
 anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his
 two motives.
 
“i have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon
 as she allowed him to speak. “you either choose this method of passing
 the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret
 affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
 appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, i should be
 completely in your way; and if the second, i can admire you much better
 as i sit by the fire.”
 
“oh, shocking!” cried miss bingley. “i never heard anything so
 abominable. how shall we punish him for such speech?”
 
“nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said elizabeth. “we
 can all plague and punish one another. tease him--laugh at him. intimate
 as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”
 
“but upon my honour i do _not_. i do assure you that my intimacy has not
 yet taught _that_. tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! no,
 no; i feel may defy us there. and as to laughter, we will not expose
 ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without subject. mr.
 darcy may hug himself.”
 
“mr. darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried elizabeth. “that is an
 uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would
 be great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. i dearly love a
 laugh.”
 
“miss bingley,” said he, “has given credit for more than can be. the
 wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may
 be rendered ridiculous by person whose first object in life is a
 joke.”
 
“certainly,” replied elizabeth, “there are such people, but i hope i am
 not one of _them_. i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good. follies
 and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, i own, and i
 laugh at them whenever i can. but these, i suppose, are precisely what
 you are without.”
 
“perhaps that is not possible for anyone. but it has been the study of
 my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose strong
 understanding to ridicule.”
 
“such as vanity and pride.”
 
“yes, vanity is weakness indeed. but pride--where there is real
 superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”
 
elizabeth turned away to hide smile.
 
“your examination of mr. darcy is over, i presume,” said miss bingley;
 “and pray what is the result?”
 
“i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has defect. owns it
 himself without disguise.”
 
“no,” said darcy, “i have made such pretension. i have faults enough,
 but they are not, i hope, of understanding. my temper i dare not vouch
 for. it is, i believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the
 convenience of the world. i cannot forget the follies and vices of
 others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself. my
 feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. my temper
 would perhaps be called resentful. my good opinion once lost is lost for
 ever.”
 
“_that_ is failing, indeed!” cried elizabeth. “implacable resentment
 _is_ shade in character. but you have chosen your fault well. i
 really cannot _laugh_ at it. you are safe from me.”
 
“there is, i believe, in every disposition tendency to some particular
 evil, natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”
 
“and _your_ defect is propensity to hate everybody.”
 
“and yours,” replied, with smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand
 them.”
 
“do let us have little music,” cried miss bingley, tired of a
 conversation in which she had share. “louisa, you will not mind my
 waking mr. hurst.”
 
her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
 opened; and darcy, after few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for
 it. began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.

in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the
 next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
 them in the course of the day. but mrs. bennet, who had calculated on
 her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which
 would exactly finish jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive
 them with pleasure before. her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
 least not to elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. mrs.
 bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
 before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr. bingley
 and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
 well. against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively
 resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
 contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
 she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley’s carriage immediately, and at
 length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
 that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.
 
the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
 said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
 jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. miss bingley was
 then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike
 of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
 
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
 soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
 safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where
 she felt herself to be right.
 
to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence: elizabeth had been at
 netherfield long enough. she attracted him more than liked; and miss
 bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. he
 wisely resolved to be particularly careful that sign of admiration
 should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
 influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been
 suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
 in confirming or crushing it. steady to his purpose, scarcely spoke
 ten words to her through the whole of saturday: and though they were at
 one time left by themselves for half an hour, adhered most
 conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
 
on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
 all, took place. miss bingley’s civility to elizabeth increased at last
 very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted,
 after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
 see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most
 tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. elizabeth took leave of
 the whole party in the liveliest spirits.
 
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. mrs. bennet
 wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
 trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again. but their
 father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
 glad to see them; had felt their importance in the family circle. the
 evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
 animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and
 elizabeth.
 
they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
 nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of
 threadbare morality to listen to. catherine and lydia had information
 for them of different sort. much had been done, and much had been said
 in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of the officers
 had dined lately with their uncle; private had been flogged; and it
 had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married.

“i hope, my dear,” said mr. bennet to his wife, as they were at
 breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered good dinner to-day,
 because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”
 
“who do you mean, my dear? i know of nobody that is coming, i am sure,
 unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in; and i hope _my_ dinners
 are good enough for her. i do not believe she often sees such at home.”
 
“the person of whom i speak is gentleman and stranger.”
 
mrs. bennet’s eyes sparkled. “a gentleman and stranger! it is mr.
 bingley, i am sure. why, jane--you never dropped word of this--you sly
 thing! well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley.
 but--good lord! how unlucky! there is not bit of fish to be got
 to-day. lydia, my love, ring the bell. i must speak to hill this
 moment.”
 
“it is _not_ mr. bingley,” said her husband; “it is person whom i
 never saw in the whole course of my life.”
 
this roused general astonishment; and had the pleasure of being
 eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.
 
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, thus
 explained:--“about month ago i received this letter, and about a
 fortnight ago i answered it; for i thought it case of some delicacy,
 and requiring early attention. it is from my cousin, mr. collins, who,
 when i am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he
 pleases.”
 
“oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
 pray do not talk of that odious man. i do think it is the hardest thing
 in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
 children; and i am sure, if i had been you, i should have tried long ago
 to do something or other about it.”
 
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
 they had often attempted it before: but it was subject on which mrs.
 bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
 bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from family of
 five daughters, in favour of man whom nobody cared anything about.
 
“it certainly is most iniquitous affair,” said mr. bennet; “and
 nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.
 but if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be little
 softened by his manner of expressing himself.”
 
“no, that i am sure i shall not: and i think it was very impertinent of
 him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. i hate such false
 friends. why could not keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
 did before him?”
 
“why, indeed, does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
 head, as you will hear.”
 
/* right “hunsford, near westerham, kent, _15th october_. */
 
“dear sir,
 
“the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
 father always gave much uneasiness; and, since i have had the
 misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the
 breach: but, for some time, i was kept back by my own doubts,
 fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for to be
 on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be
 at variance.”--‘there, mrs. bennet.’--“my mind, however, is now
 made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at easter,
 i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of
 the right honourable lady catherine bourgh, widow of sir lewis
 bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred to the
 valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
 endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
 ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
 which are instituted by the church of england. as clergyman,
 moreover, i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
 of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
 these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of
 good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my
 being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly
 overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered
 olive branch. i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
 means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to
 apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make
 them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. if you should
 have objection to receive into your house, i propose myself
 the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, monday,
 november 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your
 hospitality till the saturday se’nnight following, which i can do
 without any inconvenience, as lady catherine is far from objecting
 to my occasional absence on sunday, provided that some other
 clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. i remain, dear sir,
 with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your
 well-wisher and friend,
 
“william collins.”
 
“at four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”
 said mr. bennet, as folded up the letter. “he seems to be most
 conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, i doubt not, will
 prove valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so
 indulgent as to let him come to us again.”
 
“there is some sense in what says about the girls, however; and, if
 is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to
 discourage him.”
 
“though it is difficult,” said jane, “to guess in what way can mean
 to make us the atonement thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
 credit.”
 
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady
 catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
 his parishioners whenever it were required.
 
“he must be an oddity, i think,” said she. “i cannot make him out. there
 is something very pompous in his style. and what can mean by
 apologizing for being next in the entail? we cannot suppose would
 help it, if could. can be sensible man, sir?”
 
“no, my dear; i think not. i have great hopes of finding him quite the
 reverse. there is mixture of servility and self-importance in his
 letter which promises well. i am impatient to see him.”
 
“in point of composition,” said mary, “his letter does not seem
 defective. the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i
 think it is well expressed.”
 
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
 degree interesting. it was next to impossible that their cousin should
 come in scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
 received pleasure from the society of man in any other colour. as for
 their mother, mr. collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,
 and she was preparing to see him with degree of composure which
 astonished her husband and daughters.
 
mr. collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
 politeness by the whole family. mr. bennet indeed said little; but the
 ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr. collins seemed neither in need
 of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. was tall,
 heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. his air was grave and
 stately, and his manners were very formal. had not been long seated
 before complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine family of
 daughters, said had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
 instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that did not
 doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. this
 gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but mrs.
 bennet, who quarrelled with compliments, answered most readily,--
 
“you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may
 prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. things are settled so
 oddly.”
 
“you allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”
 
“ah, sir, i do indeed. it is grievous affair to my poor girls, you
 must confess. not that i mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,
 i know, are all chance in this world. there is knowing how estates
 will go when once they come to be entailed.”
 
“i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
 could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing
 forward and precipitate. but i can assure the young ladies that i come
 prepared to admire them. at present i will not say more, but, perhaps,
 when we are better acquainted----”
 
was interrupted by summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
 other. they were not the only objects of mr. collins’s admiration. the
 hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
 and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs. bennet’s
 heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
 own future property. the dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;
 and begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its
 cookery was owing. but here was set right by mrs. bennet, who assured
 him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep good
 cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. begged
 pardon for having displeased her. in softened tone she declared
 herself not at all offended; but continued to apologize for about a
 quarter of an hour.

chapter xiv

during dinner, mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
 were withdrawn, thought it time to have some conversation with his
 guest, and therefore started subject in which expected him to
 shine, by observing that seemed very fortunate in his patroness. lady
 catherine bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
 comfort, appeared very remarkable. mr. bennet could not have chosen
 better. mr. collins was eloquent in her praise. the subject elevated him
 to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with most important aspect
 protested that had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
 person of rank--such affability and condescension, as had himself
 experienced from lady catherine. she had been graciously pleased to
 approve of both the discourses which had already had the honour of
 preaching before her. she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings,
 and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of
 quadrille in the evening. lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
 people, knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
 she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
 made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
 neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for week or
 two to visit his relations. she had even condescended to advise him to
 marry as soon as could, provided chose with discretion; and had
 once paid him visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
 approved all the alterations had been making, and had even vouchsafed
 to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.
 
“that is all very proper and civil, i am sure,” said mrs. bennet, “and i
 dare say she is very agreeable woman. it is pity that great ladies
 in general are not more like her. does she live near you, sir?”
 
“the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by lane
 from rosings park, her ladyship’s residence.”
 
“i think you said she was widow, sir? has she any family?”
 
“she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very
 extensive property.”
 
“ah,” cried mrs. bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than
 many girls. and what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?”
 
“she is most charming young lady, indeed. lady catherine herself says
 that, in point of true beauty, miss bourgh is far superior to the
 handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
 the young woman of distinguished birth. she is unfortunately of sickly
 constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
 accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as i am
 informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
 resides with them. but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
 to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”
 
“has she been presented? i do not remember her name among the ladies at
 court.”
 
“her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
 and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived
 the british court of its brightest ornament. her ladyship seemed pleased
 with the idea; and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
 offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
 ladies. i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her
 charming daughter seemed born to be duchess; and that the most
 elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
 her. these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
 it is sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
 pay.”
 
“you judge very properly,” said mr. bennet; “and it is happy for you
 that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. may i ask
 whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
 moment, or are the result of previous study?”
 
“they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though i
 sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
 compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to
 give them as unstudied an air as possible.”
 
mr. bennet’s expectations were fully answered. his cousin was as absurd
 as had hoped; and listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
 maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
 and, except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring partner
 in his pleasure.
 
by tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and mr. bennet was glad
 to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,
 glad to invite him

“protested
 that never read novels” h.t feb 94
 ]
 
to read aloud to the ladies. mr. collins readily assented, and book
 was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be
 from circulating library) started back, and, begging pardon,
 protested that never read novels. kitty stared at him, and lydia
 exclaimed. other books were produced, and after some deliberation he
 chose “fordyce’s sermons.” lydia gaped as opened the volume; and
 before had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
 interrupted him with,--
 
“do you know, mamma, that my uncle philips talks of turning away
 richard? and if does, colonel forster will hire him. my aunt told me
 so herself on saturday. i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more
 about it, and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town.”
 
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr.
 collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--
 
“i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
 of serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. it amazes
 me, i confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
 them as instruction. but i will longer importune my young cousin.”
 
then, turning to mr. bennet, offered himself as his antagonist at
 backgammon. mr. bennet accepted the challenge, observing that acted
 very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. mrs.
 bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for lydia’s
 interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if would
 resume his book; but mr. collins, after assuring them that bore his
 young cousin ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
 affront, seated himself at another table with mr. bennet, and prepared
 for backgammon.

chapter xv.
 

[illustration]
 
mr. collins was not sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
 been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
 his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
 miserly father; and though belonged to one of the universities, he
 had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
 acquaintance. the subjection in which his father had brought him up had
 given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now good
 deal counteracted by the self-conceit of weak head, living in
 retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
 prosperity. fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
 bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
 felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
 mingling with very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
 clergyman, and his right as rector, made him altogether mixture of
 pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.
 
having now good house and very sufficient income, intended to
 marry; and in seeking reconciliation with the longbourn family had
 wife in view, as meant to choose one of the daughters, if found
 them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
 this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s
 estate; and thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
 suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
 part.
 
his plan did not vary on seeing them. miss bennet’s lovely face
 confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
 was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
 choice. the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in quarter
 of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with mrs. bennet before breakfast, a
 conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
 to the avowal of his hopes, that mistress for it might be found at
 longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
 encouragement, caution against the very jane had fixed on. “as to
 her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
 not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
 _eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to
 hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”
 
mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon
 done--done while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire. elizabeth, equally
 next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
 
mrs. bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
 two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
 the day before, was now high in her good graces.
 
lydia’s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten: every sister
 except mary agreed to go with her; and mr. collins was to attend them,
 at the request of mr. bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
 and have his library to himself; for thither mr. collins had followed
 him after breakfast, and there would continue, nominally engaged with
 one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr.
 bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford. such
 doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly. in his library had been
 always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as told
 elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
 house, was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,
 was most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in their
 walk; and mr. collins, being in fact much better fitted for walker
 than reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
 go.
 
in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
 cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton. the attention of
 the younger ones was then longer to be gained by _him_. their eyes
 were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and
 nothing less than very smart bonnet, indeed, or really new muslin in
 shop window, could recall them.
 
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by young man, whom
 they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
 with an officer on the other side of the way. the officer was the very
 mr. denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire, and
 bowed as they passed. all were struck with the stranger’s air, all
 wondered who could be; and kitty and lydia, determined if possible
 to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting
 something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the
 pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same
 spot. mr. denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
 introduce his friend, mr. wickham, who had returned with him the day
 before from town, and, was happy to say, had accepted commission in
 their corps. this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
 only regimentals to make him completely charming. his appearance was
 greatly in his favour: had all the best parts of beauty, fine
 countenance, good figure, and very pleasing address. the introduction
 was followed up on his side by happy readiness of conversation--a
 readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
 whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
 when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were
 seen riding down the street. on distinguishing the ladies of the group
 the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
 civilities. bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the
 principal object. was then, said, on his way to longbourn on
 purpose to inquire after her. mr. darcy corroborated it with bow, and
 was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they
 were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and elizabeth
 happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
 was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. both changed colour,
 one looked white, the other red. mr. wickham, after few moments,
 touched his hat--a salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return.
 what could be the meaning of it? it was impossible to imagine; it was
 impossible not to long to know.
 
in another minute mr. bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
 passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
 
mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
 mr. philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia’s
 pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs.
 philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
 invitation.
 
mrs. philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from
 their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly
 expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
 carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
 she had not happened to see mr. jones’s shopboy in the street, who had
 told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield,
 because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
 towards mr. collins by jane’s introduction of him. she received him with
 her very best politeness, which returned with as much more,
 apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
 her, which could not help flattering himself, however, might be
 justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
 her notice. mrs. philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
 breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
 by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
 could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr. denny had
 brought him from london, and that was to have lieutenant’s
 commission in the ----shire. she had been watching him the last hour,
 she said, as walked up and down the street,--and had mr. wickham
 appeared, kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;
 but unluckily one passed the windows now except few of the
 officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,
 disagreeable fellows.” some of them were to dine with the philipses the
 next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr.
 wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn
 would come in the evening. this was agreed to; and mrs. philips
 protested that they would have nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
 tickets, and little bit of hot supper afterwards. the prospect of such
 delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. mr.
 collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,
 with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.
 
as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
 between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or
 both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could more explain such
 behaviour than her sister.
 
mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs.
 philips’s manners and politeness. protested that, except lady
 catherine and her daughter, had never seen more elegant woman; for
 she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
 pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
 utterly unknown to her before. something, supposed, might be
 attributed to his connection with them, but yet had never met with so
 much attention in the whole course of his life.

as objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their
 aunt, and all mr. collins’s scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for
 single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
 conveyed him and his five cousins at suitable hour to meryton; and the
 girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
 that mr. wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in
 the house.
 
when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr.
 collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and was so much
 struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that declared he
 might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
 at rosings; comparison that did not at first convey much
 gratification; but when mrs. philips understood from him what rosings
 was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
 description of only one of lady catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found
 that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
 the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented comparison
 with the housekeeper’s room.
 
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion,
 with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
 improvements it was receiving, was happily employed until the
 gentlemen joined them; and found in mrs. philips very attentive
 listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
 heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
 soon as she could. to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
 and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
 their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the
 interval of waiting appeared very long. it was over at last, however.
 the gentlemen did approach: and when mr. wickham walked into the room,
 elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
 of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. the
 officers of the ----shire were in general very creditable,
 gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but
 mr, wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
 walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips,
 breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

“the officers of the ----shire”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
 turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom finally seated
 himself; and the agreeable manner in which immediately fell into
 conversation, though it was only on its being wet night, and on the
 probability of rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
 dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the
 skill of the speaker.
 
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the
 officers, mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
 ladies certainly was nothing; but had still at intervals kind
 listener in mrs. philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly
 supplied with coffee and muffin.
 
when the card tables were placed, had an opportunity of obliging her,
 in return, by sitting down to whist.
 
“i know little of the game at present,” said he, “but i shall be glad to
 improve myself; for in my situation of life----” mrs. philips was very
 thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
 
mr. wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
 received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia. at first there
 seemed danger of lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was most
 determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
 she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
 and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.
 allowing for the common demands of the game, mr. wickham was therefore
 at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,
 though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,
 the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy. she dared not even
 mention that gentleman. her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
 relieved. mr. wickham began the subject himself. inquired how far
 netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
 hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there.
 
“about month,” said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
 drop, added, “he is man of very large property in derbyshire, i
 understand.”
 
“yes,” replied wickham; “his estate there is noble one. clear ten
 thousand per annum. you could not have met with person more capable of
 giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been
 connected with his family, in particular manner, from my infancy.”
 
elizabeth could not but look surprised.
 
“you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after
 seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
 yesterday. are you much acquainted with mr. darcy?”
 
“as much as i ever wish to be,” cried elizabeth, warmly. “i have spent
 four days in the same house with him, and i think him very
 disagreeable.”
 
“i have right to give _my_ opinion,” said wickham, “as to his being
 agreeable or otherwise. i am not qualified to form one. i have known him
 too long and too well to be fair judge. it is impossible for _me_ to
 be impartial. but i believe your opinion of him would in general
 astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly
 anywhere else. here you are in your own family.”
 
“upon my word i say more _here_ than i might say in any house in the
 neighbourhood, except netherfield. is not at all liked in
 hertfordshire. everybody is disgusted with his pride. you will not find
 him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”
 
“i cannot pretend to be sorry,” said wickham, after short
 interruption, “that or that any man should not be estimated beyond
 their deserts; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen. the
 world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
 high and imposing manners, and sees him only as chooses to be seen.”
 
“i should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
 ill-tempered man.”
 
wickham only shook his head.
 
“i wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether is
 likely to be in this country much longer.”
 
“i do not at all know; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i
 was at netherfield. i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
 not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”
 
“oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr. darcy. if _he_
 wishes to avoid seeing _me_ must go. we are not on friendly terms,
 and it always gives pain to meet him, but i have reason for
 avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world--a sense of
 very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what is.
 his father, miss bennet, the late mr. darcy, was one of the best men
 that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be
 in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
 thousand tender recollections. his behaviour to myself has been
 scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and
 everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
 memory of his father.”
 
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
 all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
 
mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the
 neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
 had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but
 very intelligible gallantry.
 
“it was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” added,
 “which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. i know it to be a
 most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend denny tempted me
 further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
 attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them.
 society, i own, is necessary to me. i have been disappointed man, and
 my spirits will not bear solitude. i _must_ have employment and society.
 military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have
 now made it eligible. the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i
 was brought up for the church; and i should at this time have been in
 possession of most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
 were speaking of just now.”
 
“indeed!”
 
“yes--the late mr. darcy bequeathed the next presentation of the best
 living in his gift. was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
 i cannot do justice to his kindness. meant to provide for amply,
 and thought had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
 elsewhere.”
 
“good heavens!” cried elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? how could his
 will be disregarded? why did not you seek legal redress?”
 
“there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
 give hope from law. man of honour could not have doubted the
 intention, but mr. darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as merely
 conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
 to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.
 certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i
 was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
 less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
 anything to deserve to lose it. i have warm unguarded temper, and i
 may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
 freely. i can recall nothing worse. but the fact is, that we are very
 different sort of men, and that hates me.”
 
“this is quite shocking! deserves to be publicly disgraced.”
 
“some time or other _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. till i
 can forget his father, i can never defy or expose _him_.”
 
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
 ever as expressed them.
 
“but what,” said she, after pause, “can have been his motive? what can
 have induced him to behave so cruelly?”
 
“a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but
 attribute in some measure to jealousy. had the late mr. darcy liked me
 less, his might have borne with better; but his father’s uncommon
 attachment to irritated him, i believe, very early in life. had
 not temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
 of preference which was often given me.”
 
“i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked
 him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be
 despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
 descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
 this!”
 
after few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “i _do_
 remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of
 his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. his disposition
 must be dreadful.”
 
“i will not trust myself on the subject,” replied wickham; “_i_ can
 hardly be just to him.”
 
elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after time exclaimed, “to
 treat in such manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
 father!” she could have added, “a young man, too, like _you_, whose very
 countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” but she contented herself
 with--“and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
 childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest
 manner.”
 
“we were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
 part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,
 sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _my_
 father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr. philips,
 appears to do so much credit to; but gave up everything to be of use
 to the late mr. darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
 pemberley property. was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy, most
 intimate, confidential friend. mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to
 be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;
 and when, immediately before my father’s death, mr. darcy gave him a
 voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that felt it
 to be as much debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”
 
“how strange!” cried elizabeth. “how abominable! i wonder that the very
 pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you. if from better
 motive, that should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
 dishonesty i must call it.”
 
“it _is_ wonderful,” replied wickham; “for almost all his actions may be
 traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. it has
 connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. but we are none
 of us consistent; and in his behaviour to there were stronger
 impulses even than pride.”
 
“can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”
 
“yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money
 freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
 poor. family pride, and _filial_ pride, for is very proud of what his
 father was, have done this. not to appear to disgrace his family, to
 degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
 pemberley house, is powerful motive. has also _brotherly_ pride,
 which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him very kind and
 careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up
 as the most attentive and best of brothers.”
 
“what sort of girl is miss darcy?”
 
shook his head. “i wish i could call her amiable. it gives pain to
 speak ill of darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very
 proud. as child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
 of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. but she is
 nothing to now. she is handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
 and, i understand, highly accomplished. since her father’s death her
 home has been london, where lady lives with her, and superintends her
 education.”
 
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not
 help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--
 
“i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley. how can mr. bingley,
 who seems good-humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable,
 be in friendship with such man? how can they suit each other? do you
 know mr. bingley?”
 
“not at all.”
 
“he is sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. cannot know what mr.
 darcy is.”
 
“probably not; but mr. darcy can please where chooses. does not
 want abilities. can be conversible companion if thinks it worth
 his while. among those who are at all his equals in consequence, is a
 very different man from what is to the less prosperous. his pride
 never deserts him; but with the rich is liberal-minded, just,
 sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing
 something for fortune and figure.”
 
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
 the other table, and mr. collins took his station between his cousin
 elizabeth and mrs. philips. the usual inquiries as to his success were
 made by the latter. it had not been very great; had lost every point;
 but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon, assured
 her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;
 that considered the money as mere trifle, and begged she would not
 make herself uneasy.
 
“i know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a
 card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i
 am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. there
 are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to lady
 catherine bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
 little matters.”
 
mr. wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing mr. collins for
 few moments, asked elizabeth in low voice whether her relations
 were very intimately acquainted with the family of bourgh.
 
“lady catherine bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a
 living. i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her
 notice, but certainly has not known her long.”
 
“you know of course that lady catherine bourgh and lady anne darcy
 were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy.”
 
“no, indeed, i did not. i knew nothing at all of lady catherine’s
 connections. i never heard of her existence till the day before
 yesterday.”
 
“her daughter, miss bourgh, will have very large fortune, and it is
 believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”
 
this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss
 bingley. vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
 affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if were already
 self-destined to another.
 
“mr. collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
 daughter; but, from some particulars that has related of her
 ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of
 her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”
 
“i believe her to be both in great degree,” replied wickham; “i have
 not seen her for many years; but i very well remember that i never liked
 her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. she has the
 reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe
 she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
 her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
 chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of
 the first class.”
 
elizabeth allowed that had given very rational account of it, and
 they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
 an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr.
 wickham’s attentions. there could be conversation in the noise of
 mrs. philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to
 everybody. whatever said, was said well; and whatever did, done
 gracefully. elizabeth went away with her head full of him. she could
 think of nothing but of mr. wickham, and of what had told her, all
 the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
 they went, for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent. lydia
 talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
 fish she had won; and mr. collins, in describing the civility of mr. and
 mrs. philips, protesting that did not in the least regard his losses
 at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
 that crowded his cousins, had more to say than could well manage
 before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.

elizabeth related to jane, the next day, what had passed between mr.
 wickham and herself. jane listened with astonishment and concern: she
 knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr.
 bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the
 veracity of young man of such amiable appearance as wickham. the
 possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to
 interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
 done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
 throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
 otherwise explained.
 
“they have both,” said she, “been deceived, i dare say, in some way or
 other, of which we can form idea. interested people have perhaps
 misrepresented each to the other. it is, in short, impossible for us to
 conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
 without actual blame on either side.”
 
“very true, indeed; and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in
 behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
 business? do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
 somebody.”
 
“laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh out of my
 opinion. my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what disgraceful light
 it places mr. darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a
 manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. it is
 impossible. man of common humanity, man who had any value for his
 character, could be capable of it. can his most intimate friends be so
 excessively deceived in him? oh no.”
 
“i can much more easily believe mr. bingley’s being imposed on than that
 mr. wickham should invent such history of himself as gave last
 night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. if it be not
 so, let mr. darcy contradict it. besides, there was truth in his looks.”
 
“it is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. one does not know what to
 think.”
 
“i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”
 
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr.
 bingley, if _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when
 the affair became public.
 
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
 conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
 they had been speaking; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their
 personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was
 fixed for the following tuesday. the two ladies were delighted to see
 their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
 repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
 separation. to the rest of the family they paid little attention;
 avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth,
 and nothing at all to the others. they were soon gone again, rising from
 their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
 hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet’s civilities.
 
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
 female of the family. mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in
 compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
 receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself, instead of a
 ceremonious card. jane pictured to herself happy evening in the
 society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
 elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing great deal with mr.
 wickham, and of seeing confirmation of everything in mr. darcy’s look
 and behaviour. the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended
 less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they
 each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham,
 was by means the only partner who could satisfy them, and ball
 was, at any rate, ball. and even mary could assure her family that she
 had disinclination for it.
 
“while i can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. i
 think it is sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
 society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who
 consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
 everybody.”
 
elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
 not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins, she could not help asking
 him whether intended to accept mr. bingley’s invitation, and if he
 did, whether would think it proper to join in the evening’s
 amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that entertained no
 scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading rebuke,
 either from the archbishop or lady catherine bourgh, by venturing to
 dance.
 
“i am by means of opinion, i assure you,” said he, “that ball of
 this kind, given by young man of character, to respectable people, can
 have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing
 myself, that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
 cousins in the course of the evening; and i take this opportunity of
 soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a
 preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
 cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”
 
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. she had fully proposed being
 engaged by wickham for those very dances; and to have mr. collins
 instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. there was help
 for it, however. mr. wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce
 delayed little longer, and mr. collins’s proposal accepted with as
 good grace as she could. she was not the better pleased with his
 gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. it now first
 struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
 being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a
 quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
 the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
 civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
 compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
 gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
 her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
 was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. elizabeth, however, did not choose
 to take the hint, being well aware that serious dispute must be the
 consequence of any reply. mr. collins might never make the offer, and,
 till did, it was useless to quarrel about him.
 
if there had not been netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
 younger miss bennets would have been in pitiable state at this time;
 for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was
 such succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once. no
 aunt, officers, news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses
 for netherfield were got by proxy. even elizabeth might have found some
 trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement
 of her acquaintance with mr. wickham; and nothing less than dance on
 tuesday could have made such friday, saturday, sunday, and monday
 endurable to kitty and lydia.

chapter xviii.
 

[illustration]
 
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield, and looked in
 vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
 doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. the certainty of
 meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
 might not unreasonably have alarmed her. she had dressed with more than
 usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
 that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
 might be won in the course of the evening. but in an instant arose the
 dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for mr. darcy’s
 pleasure, in the bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this
 was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
 pronounced by his friend mr. denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and
 who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
 the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with significant
 smile,--
 
“i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
 had not wished to avoid certain gentleman here.”
 
this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by
 elizabeth; and, as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
 wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
 of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
 disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
 the polite inquiries which directly afterwards approached to make.
 attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to wickham. she
 was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
 with degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
 speaking to mr. bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
 
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
 of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
 spirits; and, having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she
 had not seen for week, she was soon able to make voluntary
 transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her
 particular notice. the two first dances, however, brought return of
 distress: they were dances of mortification. mr. collins, awkward and
 solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong
 without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a
 disagreeable partner for couple of dances can give. the moment of her
 release from him was ecstasy.
 
she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
 wickham, and of hearing that was universally liked. when those dances
 were over, she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with
 her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy, who took
 her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
 knowing what she did, she accepted him. walked away again
 immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
 mind: charlotte tried to console her.
 
“i dare say you will find him very agreeable.”
 
“heaven forbid! _that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! to find
 man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! do not wish such an
 evil.”
 
when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her
 hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her, in whisper, not to be a
 simpleton, and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
 in the eyes of man often times his consequence. elizabeth made no
 answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
 she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy, and
 reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
 they stood for some time without speaking word; and she began to
 imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at
 first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it
 would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,
 she made some slight observation on the dance. replied, and was again
 silent. after pause of some minutes, she addressed him second time,
 with--
 
“it is _your_ turn to say something now, mr. darcy. _i_ talked about the
 dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the
 room, or the number of couples.”
 
smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
 said.
 
“very well; that reply will do for the present. perhaps, by-and-by, i
 may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but
 _now_ we may be silent.”
 
“do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”
 
“sometimes. one must speak little, you know. it would look odd to be
 entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of
 _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
 trouble of saying as little as possible.”
 
“are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
 imagine that you are gratifying mine?”
 
“both,” replied elizabeth archly; “for i have always seen great
 similarity in the turn of our minds. we are each of an unsocial,
 taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
 something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
 posterity with all the _éclat_ of proverb.”
 
“this is very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure,”
 said he. “how near it may be to _mine_, i cannot pretend to say. _you_
 think it faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”
 
“i must not decide on my own performance.”
 
made answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down
 the dance, when asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
 walk to meryton. she answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist
 the temptation, added, “when you met us there the other day, we had just
 been forming new acquaintance.”
 
the effect was immediate. deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
 features, but said not word; and elizabeth, though blaming herself
 for her own weakness, could not go on. at length darcy spoke, and in a
 constrained manner said,--
 
“mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his
 _making_ friends; whether may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
 is less certain.”
 
“he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied elizabeth,
 with emphasis, “and in manner which is likely to suffer from all
 his life.”
 
darcy made answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. at
 that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
 through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving mr.
 darcy, stopped, with bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on
 his dancing and his partner.
 
“i have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very
 superior dancing is not often seen. it is evident that you belong to the
 first circles. allow to say, however, that your fair partner does not
 disgrace you: and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
 especially when certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza (glancing
 at her sister and bingley), shall take place. what congratulations will
 then flow in! i appeal to mr. darcy;--but let not interrupt you, sir.
 you will not thank for detaining you from the bewitching converse of
 that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”

the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir
 william’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
 eyes were directed, with very serious expression, towards bingley and
 jane, who were dancing together. recovering himself, however, shortly,
 turned to his partner, and said,--
 
“sir william’s interruption has made forget what we were talking
 of.”
 
“i do not think we were speaking at all. sir william could not have
 interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
 themselves. we have tried two or three subjects already without success,
 and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine.”
 
“what think you of books?” said he, smiling.
 
“books--oh no!--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
 feelings.”
 
“i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
 want of subject. we may compare our different opinions.”
 
“no--i cannot talk of books in ball-room; my head is always full of
 something else.”
 
“the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,
 with look of doubt.
 
“yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her
 thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
 by her suddenly exclaiming, “i remember hearing you once say, mr. darcy,
 that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was
 unappeasable. you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being
 created_?”
 
“i am,” said he, with firm voice.
 
“and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”
 
“i hope not.”
 
“it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
 to be secure of judging properly at first.”
 
“may i ask to what these questions tend?”
 
“merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring
 to shake off her gravity. “i am trying to make it out.”
 
“and what is your success?”
 
she shook her head. “i do not get on at all. i hear such different
 accounts of you as puzzle exceedingly.”
 
“i can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary
 greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were
 not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
 fear that the performance would reflect credit on either.”
 
“but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another
 opportunity.”
 
“i would by means suspend any pleasure of yours,” coldly replied.
 she said more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
 silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for
 in darcy’s breast there was tolerably powerful feeling towards her,
 which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
 another.
 
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and,
 with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--
 
“so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham?
 your sister has been talking to about him, and asking thousand
 questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his
 other communications, that was the of old wickham, the late mr.
 darcy’s steward. let recommend you, however, as friend, not to give
 implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to mr. darcy’s using
 him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, has been always
 remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a
 most infamous manner. i do not know the particulars, but i know very
 well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame; that cannot bear
 to hear george wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he
 could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he
 was excessively glad to find that had taken himself out of the way.
 his coming into the country at all is most insolent thing, indeed, and
 i wonder how could presume to do it. i pity you, miss eliza, for this
 discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his
 descent, one could not expect much better.”
 
“his guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”
 said elizabeth, angrily; “for i have heard you accuse him of nothing
 worse than of being the of mr. darcy’s steward, and of _that_, i can
 assure you, informed himself.”
 
“i beg your pardon,” replied miss bingley, turning away with sneer.
 “excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”
 
“insolent girl!” said elizabeth to herself. “you are much mistaken if
 you expect to influence by such paltry attack as this. i see
 nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr.
 darcy.” she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
 inquiries on the same subject of bingley. jane met her with smile of
 such sweet complacency, glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
 marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
 elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude
 for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave
 way before the hope of jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.
 
“i want to know,” said she, with countenance less smiling than her
 sister’s, “what you have learnt about mr. wickham. but perhaps you have
 been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case
 you may be sure of my pardon.”
 
“no,” replied jane, “i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing
 satisfactory to tell you. mr. bingley does not know the whole of his
 history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
 principally offended mr. darcy; but will vouch for the good conduct,
 the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
 mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than has
 received; and i am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his
 sister’s, mr. wickham is by means respectable young man. i am
 afraid has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr. darcy’s
 regard.”
 
“mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself.”
 
“no; never saw him till the other morning at meryton.”
 
“this account then is what has received from mr. darcy. i am
 perfectly satisfied. but what does say of the living?”
 
“he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though has heard
 them from mr. darcy more than once, but believes that it was left to
 him _conditionally_ only.”
 
“i have not doubt of mr. bingley’s sincerity,” said elizabeth warmly,
 “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. mr.
 bingley’s defence of his friend was very able one, i dare say; but
 since is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
 the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of
 both gentlemen as i did before.”
 
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
 which there could be difference of sentiment. elizabeth listened with
 delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of
 bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
 in it. on their being joined by mr. bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew
 to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
 partner she had scarcely replied, before mr. collins came up to them,
 and told her with great exultation, that had just been so fortunate
 as to make most important discovery.
 
“i have found out,” said he, “by singular accident, that there is now
 in the room near relation to my patroness. i happened to overhear the
 gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
 this house the names of his cousin miss bourgh, and of her mother,
 lady catherine. how wonderfully these sort of things occur! who would
 have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de
 bourgh in this assembly! i am most thankful that the discovery is made
 in time for to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do,
 and trust will excuse my not having done it before. my total
 ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”
 
“you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy?”
 
“indeed i am. i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
 i believe him to be lady catherine’s _nephew_. it will be in my power to
 assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”
 
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such scheme; assuring him
 that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
 an impertinent freedom, rather than compliment to his aunt; that it
 was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
 side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr. darcy, the superior in
 consequence, to begin the acquaintance. mr. collins listened to her with
 the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased
 speaking, replied thus,--
 
“my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your
 excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
 understanding, but permit to say that there must be wide difference
 between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those
 which regulate the clergy; for, give leave to observe that i consider
 the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
 in the kingdom--provided that proper humility of behaviour is at the
 same time maintained. you must, therefore, allow to follow the
 dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead to perform
 what i look on as point of duty. pardon for neglecting to profit by
 your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,
 though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education
 and habitual study to decide on what is right than young lady like
 yourself;” and with low bow left her to attack mr. darcy, whose
 reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
 being so addressed was very evident. her cousin prefaced his speech with
 solemn bow, and though she could not hear word of it, she felt as if
 hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”
 “hunsford,” and “lady catherine bourgh.” it vexed her to see him
 expose himself to such man. mr. darcy was eyeing him with
 unrestrained wonder; and when at last mr. collins allowed him to speak,
 replied with an air of distant civility. mr. collins, however, was not
 discouraged from speaking again, and mr. darcy’s contempt seemed
 abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the
 end of it only made him slight bow, and moved another way: mr.
 collins then returned to elizabeth.
 
“i have reason, i assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my
 reception. mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. answered
 with the utmost civility, and even paid the compliment of saying,
 that was so well convinced of lady catherine’s discernment as to be
 certain she could never bestow favour unworthily. it was really very
 handsome thought. upon the whole, i am much pleased with him.”
 
as elizabeth had longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
 her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley; and the
 train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made
 her perhaps almost as happy as jane. she saw her in idea settled in that
 very house, in all the felicity which marriage of true affection could
 bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
 even to like bingley’s two sisters. her mother’s thoughts she plainly
 saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,
 lest she might hear too much. when they sat down to supper, therefore,
 she considered it most unlucky perverseness which placed them within
 one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was
 talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing
 else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr.
 bingley. it was an animating subject, and mrs. bennet seemed incapable
 of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. his being such
 charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,
 were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a
 comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be
 certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. it
 was, moreover, such promising thing for her younger daughters, as
 jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;
 and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to
 consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might
 not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. it was necessary
 to make this circumstance matter of pleasure, because on such
 occasions it is the etiquette; but one was less likely than mrs.
 bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. she
 concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
 fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
 chance of it.
 
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s
 words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in less audible
 whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the
 chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy, who sat opposite to them. her
 mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
 
“what is mr. darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him? i am
 sure we owe him such particular civility as to be obliged to say
 nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”
 
“for heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. what advantage can it be to you
 to offend mr. darcy? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
 so doing.”
 
nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. her mother would
 talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. elizabeth blushed and
 blushed again with shame and vexation. she could not help frequently
 glancing her eye at mr. darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
 she dreaded; for though was not always looking at her mother, she was
 convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. the expression
 of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to composed and
 steady gravity.
 
at length, however, mrs. bennet had more to say; and lady lucas, who
 had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
 likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
 elizabeth now began to revive. but not long was the interval of
 tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
 had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty,
 preparing to oblige the company. by many significant looks and silent
 entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such proof of
 complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an
 opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
 elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and
 she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
 which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving
 amongst the thanks of the table the hint of hope that she might be
 prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half minute
 began another. mary’s powers were by means fitted for such display;
 her voice was weak, and her manner affected. elizabeth was in agonies.
 she looked at jane to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly
 talking to bingley. she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
 signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued, however,
 impenetrably grave. she looked at her father to entreat his
 interference, lest mary should be singing all night. took the hint,
 and, when mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--
 
“that will do extremely well, child. you have delighted us long enough.
 let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”
 
mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
 elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid
 her anxiety had done good. others of the party were now applied to.
 
“if i,” said mr. collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i
 should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an
 air; for i consider music as very innocent diversion, and perfectly
 compatible with the profession of clergyman. i do not mean, however,
 to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
 music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. the
 rector of parish has much to do. in the first place, must make such
 an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
 offensive to his patron. must write his own sermons; and the time
 that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
 and improvement of his dwelling, which cannot be excused from making
 as comfortable as possible. and i do not think it of light importance
 that should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards
 everybody, especially towards those to whom owes his preferment. i
 cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who
 should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody
 connected with the family.” and with bow to mr. darcy, concluded
 his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the
 room. many stared--many smiled; but one looked more amused than mr.
 bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for
 having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in half-whisper to lady
 lucas, that was remarkably clever, good kind of young man.
 
to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
 expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
 have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
 finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
 that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
 feelings were not of sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
 must have witnessed. that his two sisters and mr. darcy, however, should
 have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and
 she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
 the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
 
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement. she was teased by
 mr. collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he
 could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
 power to dance with others. in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
 somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the
 room. assured her that, as to dancing, was perfectly indifferent
 to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend
 himself to her; and that should therefore make point of remaining
 close to her the whole evening. there was arguing upon such a
 project. she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who
 often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged mr. collins’s conversation
 to herself.
 
she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy’s further notice:
 though often standing within very short distance of her, quite
 disengaged, never came near enough to speak. she felt it to be the
 probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham, and rejoiced in
 it.
 
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
 manœuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriage quarter of an
 hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
 heartily they were wished away by some of the family. mrs. hurst and her
 sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
 were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. they repulsed
 every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a
 languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long
 speeches of mr. collins, who was complimenting mr. bingley and his
 sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
 politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. darcy said
 nothing at all. mr. bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
 mr. bingley and jane were standing together little detached from the
 rest, and talked only to each other. elizabeth preserved as steady a
 silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too
 much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “lord,
 how tired i am!” accompanied by violent yawn.
 
when at length they arose to take leave, mrs. bennet was most pressingly
 civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and
 addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley, to assure him how happy
 would make them, by eating family dinner with them at any time,
 without the ceremony of formal invitation. bingley was all grateful
 pleasure; and readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
 waiting on her after his return from london, whither was obliged to
 go the next day for short time.
 
mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
 delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
 settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
 see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four
 months. of having another daughter married to mr. collins she thought
 with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
 elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
 man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
 was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield.

chapter xix.
 

[illustration]
 
the next day opened new scene at longbourn. mr. collins made his
 declaration in form. having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
 his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having
 feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
 moment, set about it in very orderly manner, with all the
 observances which supposed regular part of the business. on finding
 mrs. bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
 after breakfast, addressed the mother in these words,--
 
“may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth,
 when i solicit for the honour of private audience with her in the
 course of this morning?”
 
before elizabeth had time for anything but blush of surprise, mrs.
 bennet instantly answered,--
 
“oh dear! yes, certainly. i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am sure
 she can have objection. come, kitty, i want you upstairs.” and
 gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth
 called out,--
 
“dear ma’am, do not go. i beg you will not go. mr. collins must excuse
 me. can have nothing to say to that anybody need not hear. i am
 going away myself.”
 
“no, no, nonsense, lizzy. i desire you will stay where you are.” and
 upon elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
 to escape, she added, “lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
 mr. collins.”
 
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and moment’s
 consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
 over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
 to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided
 between distress and diversion. mrs. bennet and kitty walked off, and as
 soon as they were gone, mr. collins began,--
 
“believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
 doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. you
 would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
 unwillingness; but allow to assure you that i have your respected
 mother’s permission for this address. you can hardly doubt the purport
 of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
 dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. almost as
 soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my
 future life. but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
 subject, perhaps it will be advisable for to state my reasons for
 marrying--and, moreover, for coming into hertfordshire with the design
 of selecting wife, as i certainly did.”
 
the idea of mr. collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
 with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
 use the short pause allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
 continued,--
 
“my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it right thing for
 every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
 of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that i am convinced it will add
 very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps i ought to
 have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
 recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling
 patroness. twice has she condescended to give her opinion (unasked
 too!) on this subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i
 left hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while mrs. jenkinson was
 arranging miss bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘mr. collins, you
 must marry. clergyman like you must marry. choose properly, choose a
 gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,
 useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make small
 income go good way. this is my advice. find such woman as soon as
 you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.’ allow me, by the
 way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and
 kindness of lady catherine bourgh as among the least of the
 advantages in my power to offer. you will find her manners beyond
 anything i can describe; and your wit and vivacity, i think, must be
 acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
 which her rank will inevitably excite. thus much for my general
 intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
 were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i
 assure you there are many amiable young women. but the fact is, that
 being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
 father (who, however, may live many years longer), i could not satisfy
 myself without resolving to choose wife from among his daughters, that
 the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy
 event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be
 for several years. this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i
 flatter myself it will not sink in your esteem. and now nothing
 remains for but to assure you in the most animated language of the
 violence of my affection. to fortune i am perfectly indifferent, and
 shall make demand of that nature on your father, since i am well
 aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
 in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s
 decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. on that head,
 therefore, i shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that
 ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”
 
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
 
“you are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “you forget that i have made no
 answer. let do it without further loss of time. accept my thanks for
 the compliment you are paying me. i am very sensible of the honour of
 your proposals, but it is impossible for to do otherwise than decline
 them.”
 
“i am not now to learn,” replied mr. collins, with formal wave of the
 hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
 man whom they secretly mean to accept, when first applies for their
 favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated second or even a
 third time. i am, therefore, by means discouraged by what you have
 just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”
 
“upon my word, sir,” cried elizabeth, “your hope is rather an
 extraordinary one after my declaration. i do assure you that i am not
 one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
 daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked second
 time. i am perfectly serious in my refusal. you could not make _me_
 happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
 would make _you_ so. nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i
 am persuaded she would find in every respect ill qualified for the
 situation.”
 
“were it certain that lady catherine would think so,” said mr. collins,
 very gravely--“but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
 disapprove of you. and you may be certain that when i have the honour of
 seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
 economy, and other amiable qualifications.”
 
“indeed, mr. collins, all praise of will be unnecessary. you must
 give leave to judge for myself, and pay the compliment of
 believing what i say. i wish you very happy and very rich, and by
 refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
 in making the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
 feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn
 estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. this matter may be
 considered, therefore, as finally settled.” and rising as she thus
 spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr. collins thus
 addressed her,--
 
“when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, i
 shall hope to receive more favourable answer than you have now given
 me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i
 know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject man on the
 first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to
 encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
 female character.”
 
“really, mr. collins,” cried elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me
 exceedingly. if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
 of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such way as
 may convince you of its being one.”
 
“you must give leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
 refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. my reasons for
 believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to that my hand
 is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer
 would be any other than highly desirable. my situation in life, my
 connections with the family of bourgh, and my relationship to your
 own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into
 further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is
 by means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.
 your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo
 the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. as i must,
 therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i
 shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
 suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”
 
“i do assure you, sir, that i have pretensions whatever to that kind
 of elegance which consists in tormenting respectable man. i would
 rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. i thank you
 again and again for the honour you have done in your proposals, but
 to accept them is absolutely impossible. my feelings in every respect
 forbid it. can i speak plainer? do not consider now as an elegant
 female intending to plague you, but as rational creature speaking the
 truth from her heart.”
 
“you are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward
 gallantry; “and i am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express
 authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
 being acceptable.”
 
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no
 reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he
 persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
 encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
 in such manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
 not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.

mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
 successful love; for mrs. bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
 to watch for the end of the conference, sooner saw elizabeth open the
 door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
 entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
 warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. mr. collins
 received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
 proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
 of which trusted had every reason to be satisfied, since the
 refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
 from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
 
this information, however, startled mrs. bennet: she would have been
 glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
 him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
 and could not help saying so.
 
“but depend upon it, mr. collins,” she added, “that lizzy shall be
 brought to reason. i will speak to her about it myself directly. she is
 very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
 i will _make_ her know it.”
 
“pardon for interrupting you, madam,” cried mr. collins; “but if she
 is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would
 altogether be very desirable wife to man in my situation, who
 naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. if, therefore, she
 actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
 force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of
 temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”
 
“sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said mrs. bennet, alarmed. “lizzy is
 only headstrong in such matters as these. in everything else she is as
 good-natured girl as ever lived. i will go directly to mr. bennet, and
 we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure.”
 
she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
 husband, called out, as she entered the library,--
 
“oh, mr. bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
 you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins, for she vows she will
 not have him; and if you do not make haste will change his mind and
 not have _her_.”
 
mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
 on her face with calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by
 her communication.
 
“i have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had
 finished her speech. “of what are you talking?”
 
“of mr. collins and lizzy. lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins,
 and mr. collins begins to say that will not have lizzy.”
 
“and what am i to do on the occasion? it seems hopeless business.”
 
“speak to lizzy about it yourself. tell her that you insist upon her
 marrying him.”
 
“let her be called down. she shall hear my opinion.”
 
mrs. bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
 library.
 
“come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “i have sent for
 you on an affair of importance. i understand that mr. collins has made
 you an offer of marriage. is it true?”
 
elizabeth replied that it was.
 
“very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”
 
“i have, sir.”
 
“very well. we now come to the point. your mother insists upon your
 accepting it. is it not so, mrs. bennet?”
 
“yes, or i will never see her again.”
 
“an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth. from this day you must
 be stranger to one of your parents. your mother will never see you
 again if you do _not_ marry mr. collins, and i will never see you again
 if you _do_.”
 
elizabeth could not but smile at such conclusion of such beginning;
 but mrs. bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
 affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
 
“what do you mean, mr. bennet, by talking in this way? you promised me
 to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”
 
“my dear,” replied her husband, “i have two small favours to request.
 first, that you will allow the free use of my understanding on the
 present occasion; and, secondly, of my room. i shall be glad to have the
 library to myself as soon as may be.”
 
not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
 mrs. bennet give up the point. she talked to elizabeth again and again;
 coaxed and threatened her by turns. she endeavoured to secure jane in
 her interest, but jane, with all possible mildness, declined
 interfering; and elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
 sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. though her manner
 varied, however, her determination never did.
 
mr. collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
 thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
 could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, suffered in other
 way. his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
 deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
 
while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend
 the day with them. she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to
 her, cried in half whisper, “i am glad you are come, for there is such
 fun here! what do you think has happened this morning? mr. collins has
 made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him.”
 
[illustration:
 
“they entered the breakfast room”
 ]
 
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty,
 who came to tell the same news; and sooner had they entered the
 breakfast-room, where mrs. bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
 the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating
 her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of her
 family. “pray do, my dear miss lucas,” she added, in melancholy tone;
 “for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; i am cruelly used,
 nobody feels for my poor nerves.”
 
charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.
 
“ay, there she comes,” continued mrs. bennet, “looking as unconcerned as
 may be, and caring more for us than if we were at york, provided she
 can have her own way. but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take it
 into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
 you will never get husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is
 to maintain you when your father is dead. _i_ shall not be able to keep
 you--and so i warn you. i have done with you from this very day. i told
 you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you again,
 and you will find as good as my word. i have pleasure in talking
 to undutiful children. not that i have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
 to anybody. people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have
 great inclination for talking. nobody can tell what i suffer! but it
 is always so. those who do not complain are never pitied.”
 
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
 attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.
 she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
 they were joined by mr. collins, who entered with an air more stately
 than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--
 
“now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
 let mr. collins and have little conversation together.”
 
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but
 lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte,
 detained first by the civility of mr. collins, whose inquiries after
 herself and all her family were very minute, and then by little
 curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
 not to hear. in doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected
 conversation:--
 
“oh, mr. collins!”
 
“my dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.
 far be it from me,” presently continued, in voice that marked his
 displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. resignation to
 inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of young man
 who has been so fortunate as i have been, in early preferment; and, i
 trust, i am resigned. perhaps not the less so from feeling doubt of my
 positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured with her hand; for i
 have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the
 blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.
 you will not, i hope, consider as showing any disrespect to your
 family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
 daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the
 compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.
 my conduct may, i fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
 dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all
 liable to error. i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
 my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
 consideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_
 has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologize.”

chapter xxi.

the discussion of mr. collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and
 elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
 attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.
 as for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
 by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
 stiffness of manner and resentful silence. scarcely ever spoke to
 her; and the assiduous attentions which had been so sensible of
 himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose
 civility in listening to him was seasonable relief to them all, and
 especially to her friend.
 
the morrow produced abatement of mrs. bennet’s ill humour or ill
 health. mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride. elizabeth
 had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
 not appear in the least affected by it. was always to have gone on
 saturday, and to saturday still meant to stay.
 
after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton, to inquire if mr. wickham
 were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.
 joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
 aunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were
 well talked over. to elizabeth, however, voluntarily acknowledged
 that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.
 
“i found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that i had better not meet
 mr. darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
 many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes
 might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”
 
she highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for full
 discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly
 bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with
 them to longbourn, and during the walk particularly attended to her.
 his accompanying them was double advantage: she felt all the
 compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an
 occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
 
[illustration: “walked back with them”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
soon after their return, letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came
 from netherfield, and was opened immediately. the envelope contained a
 sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with lady’s
 fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as
 she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
 jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to
 join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but
 elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
 even from wickham; and sooner had and his companion taken leave,
 than glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs. when they
 had gained their own room, jane, taking out her letter, said, “this is
 from caroline bingley: what it contains has surprised good deal.
 the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way
 to town; and without any intention of coming back again. you shall hear
 what she says.”
 
she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
 of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
 and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr.
 hurst had house. the next was in these words:--“‘i do not pretend to
 regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society, my
 dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many
 returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the
 meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by very frequent and most
 unreserved correspondence. i depend on you for that.’” to these
 high-flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
 distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
 saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their
 absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley’s being there; and as
 to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon
 cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.
 
“it is unlucky,” said she, after short pause, “that you should not be
 able to see your friends before they leave the country. but may we not
 hope that the period of future happiness, to which miss bingley looks
 forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
 intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
 satisfaction as sisters? mr. bingley will not be detained in london by
 them.”
 
“caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
 hertfordshire this winter. i will read it to you.
 
“‘when my brother left us yesterday, imagined that the business which
 took him to london might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
 are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
 charles gets to town will be in hurry to leave it again, we have
 determined on following him thither, that may not be obliged to spend
 his vacant hours in comfortless hotel. many of my acquaintance are
 already there for the winter: i wish i could hear that you, my dearest
 friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that i
 despair. i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in
 the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
 will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of
 whom we shall deprive you.’
 
“it is evident by this,” added jane, “that comes back more this
 winter.”
 
“it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean _should_.”
 
“why will you think so? it must be his own doing; is his own master.
 but you do not know _all_. i _will_ read you the passage which
 particularly hurts me. i will have reserves from _you_. ‘mr. darcy is
 impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely
 less eager to meet her again. i really do not think georgiana darcy has
 her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection
 she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still
 more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being
 hereafter our sister. i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to
 you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the country
 without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them
 unreasonable. my brother admires her greatly already; will have
 frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her
 relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and sister’s
 partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most
 capable of engaging any woman’s heart. with all these circumstances to
 favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest
 jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
 of so many?’ what think you of _this_ sentence, my dear lizzy?” said
 jane, as she finished it. “is it not clear enough? does it not expressly
 declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes to be her sister;
 that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that
 if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most
 kindly!) to put on my guard. can there be any other opinion on the
 subject?”
 
“yes, there can; for mine is totally different. will you hear it?”
 
“most willingly.”
 
“you shall have it in few words. miss bingley sees that her brother is
 in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy. she follows him to
 town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
 does not care about you.”
 
jane shook her head.
 
“indeed, jane, you ought to believe me. one who has ever seen you
 together can doubt his affection; miss bingley, i am sure, cannot: she
 is not such simpleton. could she have seen half as much love in mr.
 darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. but the
 case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
 is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion
 that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble
 in achieving second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i
 dare say it would succeed if miss bourgh were out of the way. but, my
 dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because miss bingley
 tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, is in the smallest
 degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when took leave of you on
 tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
 of being in love with you, is very much in love with her friend.”
 
“if we thought alike of miss bingley,” replied jane, “your
 representation of all this might make quite easy. but i know the
 foundation is unjust. caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
 anyone; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
 herself.”
 
“that is right. you could not have started more happy idea, since you
 will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.
 you have now done your duty by her, and must fret longer.”
 
“but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in
 accepting man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
 elsewhere?”
 
“you must decide for yourself,” said elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
 deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
 more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you,
 by all means, to refuse him.”
 
“how can you talk so?” said jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,
 though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could
 not hesitate.”
 
“i did not think you would; and that being the case, i cannot consider
 your situation with much compassion.”
 
“but if returns more this winter, my choice will never be
 required. thousand things may arise in six months.”
 
the idea of his returning more elizabeth treated with the utmost
 contempt. it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline’s
 interested wishes; and she could not for moment suppose that those
 wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence young man
 so totally independent of everyone.
 
she represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on
 the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
 jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,
 though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
 bingley would return to netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.
 
they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the
 family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;
 but even this partial communication gave her great deal of concern,
 and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
 to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. after
 lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of
 thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at
 longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,
 that, though had been invited only to family dinner, she would take
 care to have two full courses.

chapter xxii.

the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases; and again, during the
 chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins.
 elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “it keeps him in good
 humour,” said she, “and i am more obliged to you than i can express.”
 
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
 that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. this was
 very amiable; but charlotte’s kindness extended farther than elizabeth
 had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her
 from any return of mr. collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards
 herself. such was miss lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so
 favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
 sure of success if had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.
 but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
 character; for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
 morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
 himself at her feet. was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
 from conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
 conjecture his design, and was not willing to have the attempt known
 till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost
 secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
 was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday. his
 reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. miss lucas
 perceived him from an upper window as walked towards the house, and
 instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. but little had
 she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
 
in as short time as mr. collins’s long speeches would allow,
 everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
 they entered the house, earnestly entreated her to name the day that
 was to make him the happiest of men; and though such solicitation must
 be waived for the present, the lady felt inclination to trifle with
 his happiness. the stupidity with which was favoured by nature must
 guard his courtship from any charm that could make woman wish for its
 continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
 disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
 establishment were gained.
 
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
 and it was bestowed with most joyful alacrity. mr. collins’s present
 circumstances made it most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
 they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
 exceedingly fair. lady lucas began directly to calculate, with more
 interest than the matter had ever
 
[illustration:
 
“so much love and eloquence”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
excited before, how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live; and
 sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever mr. collins
 should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly
 expedient that both and his wife should make their appearance at st.
 james’s. the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the
 occasion. the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ year or two
 sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved
 from their apprehension of charlotte’s dying an old maid. charlotte
 herself was tolerably composed. she had gained her point, and had time
 to consider of it. her reflections were in general satisfactory. mr.
 collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was
 irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. but still would
 be her husband. without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,
 marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable
 provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however
 uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative
 from want. this preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of
 twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good
 luck of it. the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the
 surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she
 valued beyond that of any other person. elizabeth would wonder, and
 probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
 shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation. she resolved
 to give her the information herself; and therefore charged mr. collins,
 when returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop hint of what had
 passed before any of the family. promise of secrecy was of course very
 dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
 curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
 questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and was
 at the same time exercising great self-denial, for was longing to
 publish his prosperous love.
 
as was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of
 the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies
 moved for the night; and mrs. bennet, with great politeness and
 cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again,
 whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.
 
“my dear madam,” replied, “this invitation is particularly
 gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you
 may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
 possible.”
 
they were all astonished; and mr. bennet, who could by means wish for
 so speedy return, immediately said,--
 
“but is there not danger of lady catherine’s disapprobation here, my
 good sir? you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
 offending your patroness.”
 
“my dear sir,” replied mr. collins, “i am particularly obliged to you
 for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
 material step without her ladyship’s concurrence.”
 
“you cannot be too much on your guard. risk anything rather than her
 displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
 again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
 and be satisfied that _we_ shall take offence.”
 
“believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
 affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive
 from letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of
 your regard during my stay in hertfordshire. as for my fair cousins,
 though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall
 now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
 my cousin elizabeth.”
 
with proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
 surprised to find that meditated quick return. mrs. bennet wished
 to understand by it that thought of paying his addresses to one of
 her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a
 solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no
 means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and
 improve himself by such an example as hers, might become very
 agreeable companion. but on the following morning every hope of this
 kind was done away. miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
 private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.
 
the possibility of mr. collins’s fancying himself in love with her
 friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two: but
 that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility
 as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was
 consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
 she could not help crying out,--
 
“engaged to mr. collins! my dear charlotte, impossible!”
 
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
 story gave way to momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
 reproach; though, as it was more than she expected, she soon regained
 her composure, and calmly replied,--
 
“why should you be surprised, my dear eliza? do you think it incredible
 that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,
 because was not so happy as to succeed with you?”
 
but elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making strong effort
 for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the
 prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she
 wished her all imaginable happiness.
 
“i see what you are feeling,” replied charlotte; “you must be surprised,
 very much surprised, so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you.
 but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be
 satisfied with what i have done. i am not romantic, you know. i never
 was. i ask only comfortable home; and, considering mr. collins’s
 character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my
 chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
 entering the marriage state.”
 
elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,
 they returned to the rest of the family. charlotte did not stay much
 longer; and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. it
 was long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
 unsuitable match. the strangeness of mr. collins’s making two offers
 of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
 accepted. she had always felt that charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was
 not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible
 that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
 feeling to worldly advantage. charlotte, the wife of mr. collins, was a
 most humiliating picture! and to the pang of friend disgracing
 herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
 that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
 she had chosen.

chapter xxiii.
 

[illustration]
 
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
 she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,
 when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
 announce her engagement to the family. with many compliments to them,
 and much self-gratulation on the prospect of connection between the
 houses, unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
 but incredulous; for mrs. bennet, with more perseverance than
 politeness, protested must be entirely mistaken; and lydia, always
 unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--
 
“good lord! sir william, how can you tell such story? do not you know
 that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy?”
 
nothing less than the complaisance of courtier could have borne
 without anger such treatment: but sir william’s good-breeding carried
 him through it all; and though begged leave to be positive as to the
 truth of his information, listened to all their impertinence with the
 most forbearing courtesy.
 
elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
 situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
 mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and
 endeavoured to put stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
 by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she
 was readily joined by jane, and by making variety of remarks on the
 happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
 of mr. collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.
 
mrs. bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say great deal while
 sir william remained; but sooner had left them than her feelings
 found rapid vent. in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
 the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr. collins
 had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
 together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. two
 inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
 elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
 she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
 points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. nothing could
 console and nothing appease her. nor did that day wear out her
 resentment. week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
 scolding her: month passed away before she could speak to sir william
 or lady lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she
 could at all forgive their daughter.
 
mr. bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
 as did experience pronounced to be of most agreeable sort; for
 it gratified him, said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom had
 been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
 more foolish than his daughter!
 
jane confessed herself little surprised at the match: but she said
 less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
 nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. kitty and
 lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr. collins was only a
 clergyman; and it affected them in other way than as piece of news
 to spread at meryton.
 
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
 mrs. bennet the comfort of having daughter well married; and she
 called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
 though mrs. bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
 enough to drive happiness away.
 
between elizabeth and charlotte there was restraint which kept them
 mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no
 real confidence could ever subsist between them again. her
 disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
 sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
 never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
 bingley had now been gone week, and nothing was heard of his return.
 
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
 the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. the promised
 letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their
 father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
 twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. after
 discharging his conscience on that head, proceeded to inform them,
 with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the
 affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained
 that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that had
 been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at
 longbourn, whither hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight;
 for lady catherine, added, so heartily approved his marriage, that
 she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which trusted would
 be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early
 day for making him the happiest of men.
 
mr. collins’s return into hertfordshire was longer matter of
 pleasure to mrs. bennet. on the contrary, she was as much disposed to
 complain of it as her husband. it was very strange that should come
 to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient
 and exceedingly troublesome. she hated having visitors in the house
 while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
 most disagreeable. such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet, and they
 gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley’s continued
 absence.
 
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. day after
 day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
 report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming more to
 netherfield the whole winter; report which highly incensed mrs.
 bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as most scandalous
 falsehood.
 
even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that
 his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. unwilling as she
 was to admit an idea so destructive to jane’s happiness, and so
 dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
 frequently recurring. the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,
 and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss
 darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for
 the strength of his attachment.
 
as for jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
 painful than elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of
 concealing; and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject
 was never alluded to. but as such delicacy restrained her mother, an
 hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her
 impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he
 did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. it needed all
 jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
 tranquillity.
 
mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his
 reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
 first introduction. was too happy, however, to need much attention;
 and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
 from great deal of his company. the chief of every day was spent by
 him at lucas lodge, and sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
 to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
 
[illustration:
 
“_whenever she spoke in low voice_”
 ]
 
mrs. bennet was really in most pitiable state. the very mention of
 anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and
 wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. the sight of
 miss lucas was odious to her. as her successor in that house, she
 regarded her with jealous abhorrence. whenever charlotte came to see
 them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
 whenever she spoke in low voice to mr. collins, was convinced that
 they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
 and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr. bennet was dead. she
 complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
 
“indeed, mr. bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that charlotte
 lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _i_ should be forced
 to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”
 
“my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. let us hope for
 better things. let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor.”
 
this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet; and, therefore, instead of
 making any answer, she went on as before.
 
“i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. if it was
 not for the entail, i should not mind it.”
 
“what should not you mind?”
 
“i should not mind anything at all.”
 
“let us be thankful that you are preserved from state of such
 insensibility.”
 
“i never can be thankful, mr. bennet, for anything about the entail. how
 anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own
 daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr. collins, too!
 why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”
 
“i leave it to yourself to determine,” said mr. bennet.

chapter xxiv.
 

[illustration]
 
miss bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. the very first
 sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
 the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had
 time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before left
 the country.
 
hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of
 the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
 writer, that could give her any comfort. miss darcy’s praise occupied
 the chief of it. her many attractions were again dwelt on; and caroline
 boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
 the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
 letter. she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an
 inmate of mr. darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
 the latter with regard to new furniture.
 
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
 heard it in silent indignation. her heart was divided between concern
 for her sister and resentment against all others. to caroline’s
 assertion of her brother’s being partial to miss darcy, she paid no
 credit. that was really fond of jane, she doubted more than she
 had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
 could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
 of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
 of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
 the caprice of their inclinations. had his own happiness, however, been
 the only sacrifice, might have been allowed to sport with it in
 whatever manner thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as
 she thought must be sensible himself. it was subject, in short, on
 which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. she
 could think of nothing else; and yet, whether bingley’s regard had
 really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;
 whether had been aware of jane’s attachment, or whether it had
 escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of
 him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s
 situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.
 
day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
 elizabeth; but at last, on mrs. bennet’s leaving them together, after a
 longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could
 not help saying,--
 
“o that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no
 idea of the pain she gives by her continual reflections on him. but i
 will not repine. it cannot last long. will be forgot, and we shall
 all be as we were before.”
 
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
 nothing.
 
“you doubt me,” cried jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no
 reason. may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
 acquaintance but that is all. i have nothing either to hope or fear, and
 nothing to reproach him with. thank god i have not _that_ pain. little
 time, therefore--i shall certainly try to get the better----”
 
with stronger voice she soon added, “i have this comfort immediately,
 that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
 has done harm to anyone but myself.”
 
“my dear jane,” exclaimed elizabeth, “you are too good. your sweetness
 and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to
 you. i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you
 deserve.”
 
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
 the praise on her sister’s warm affection.
 
“nay,” said elizabeth, “this is not fair. _you_ wish to think all the
 world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody. _i_ only want
 to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. do not be
 afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
 privilege of universal good-will. you need not. there are few people
 whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well. the more i see
 of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
 my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
 little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
 or sense. i have met with two instances lately: one i will not mention,
 the other is charlotte’s marriage. it is unaccountable! in every view it
 is unaccountable!”
 
“my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. they will
 ruin your happiness. you do not make allowance enough for difference of
 situation and temper. consider mr. collins’s respectability, and
 charlotte’s prudent, steady character. remember that she is one of a
 large family; that as to fortune it is most eligible match; and be
 ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like
 regard and esteem for our cousin.”
 
“to oblige you, i would try to believe almost anything, but one else
 could be benefited by such belief as this; for were i persuaded that
 charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her
 understanding than i now do of her heart. my dear jane, mr. collins is a
 conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know is, as well as
 i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries him
 cannot have proper way of thinking. you shall not defend her, though
 it is charlotte lucas. you shall not, for the sake of one individual,
 change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
 yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
 danger security for happiness.”
 
“i must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied
 jane; “and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
 together. but enough of this. you alluded to something else. you
 mentioned _two_ instances. i cannot misunderstand you, but i entreat
 you, dear lizzy, not to pain by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
 saying your opinion of him is sunk. we must not be so ready to fancy
 ourselves intentionally injured. we must not expect lively young man
 to be always so guarded and circumspect. it is very often nothing but
 our own vanity that deceives us. women fancy admiration means more than
 it does.”
 
“and men take care that they should.”
 
“if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have idea
 of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”
 
“i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingley’s conduct to design,”
 said elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
 unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. thoughtlessness,
 want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,
 will do the business.”
 
“and do you impute it to either of those?”
 
“yes; to the last. but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i
 think of persons you esteem. stop me, whilst you can.”
 
“you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”
 
“yes, in conjunction with his friend.”
 
“i cannot believe it. why should they try to influence him? they can
 only wish his happiness; and if is attached to other woman can
 secure it.”
 
“your first position is false. they may wish many things besides his
 happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
 may wish him to marry girl who has all the importance of money, great
 connections, and pride.”
 
“beyond doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy,” replied jane;
 “but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. they have
 known her much longer than they have known me; wonder if they love
 her better. but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
 they should have opposed their brother’s. what sister would think
 herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
 objectionable? if they believed him attached to they would not try to
 part us; if were so, they could not succeed. by supposing such an
 affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and most
 unhappy. do not distress by the idea. i am not ashamed of having been
 mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
 what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. let take it
 in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”
 
elizabeth could not oppose such wish; and from this time mr. bingley’s
 name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
 
mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
 more; and though day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
 for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
 with less perplexity. her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
 she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely
 the effect of common and transient liking, which ceased when saw
 her more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
 the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. mrs. bennet’s best
 comfort was, that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer.
 
mr. bennet treated the matter differently. “so, lizzy,” said he, one
 day, “your sister is crossed in love, i find. i congratulate her. next
 to being married, girl likes to be crossed in love little now and
 then. it is something to think of, and gives her sort of distinction
 among her companions. when is your turn to come? you will hardly bear to
 be long outdone by jane. now is your time. here are officers enough at
 meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. let wickham
 be your man. is pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”
 
“thank you, sir, but less agreeable man would satisfy me. we must not
 all expect jane’s good fortune.”
 
“true,” said mr. bennet; “but it is comfort to think that, whatever of
 that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will
 always make the most of it.”
 
mr. wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
 which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
 family. they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
 added that of general unreserve. the whole of what elizabeth had already
 heard, his claims on mr. darcy, and all that had suffered from him,
 was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
 pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they
 had known anything of the matter.
 
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
 extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of
 hertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
 allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else
 mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men.

chapter xxv.
 

[illustration]
 
after week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr.
 collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
 saturday. the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
 side by preparations for the reception of his bride, as had reason to
 hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day
 would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. took leave
 of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
 his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
 another letter of thanks.
 
on the following monday, mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
 brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the christmas at
 longbourn. mr. gardiner was sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
 superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. the netherfield
 ladies would have had difficulty in believing that man who lived by
 trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
 well-bred and agreeable. mrs. gardiner, who was several years younger
 than mrs. bennet and mrs. philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
 woman, and great favourite with her longbourn nieces. between the two
 eldest and herself especially, there subsisted very particular regard.
 they had frequently been staying with her in town.
 
the first part of mrs. gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to
 distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. when this was
 done, she had less active part to play. it became her turn to listen.
 mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. they
 had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. two of her
 girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
 in it.
 
“i do not blame jane,” she continued, “for jane would have got mr.
 bingley if she could. but, lizzy! oh, sister! it is very hard to think
 that she might have been mr. collins’s wife by this time, had not it
 been for her own perverseness. made her an offer in this very room,
 and she refused him. the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have
 daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as
 much entailed as ever. the lucases are very artful people, indeed,
 sister. they are all for what they can get. i am sorry to say it of
 them, but so it is. it makes very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
 so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
 before anybody else. however, your coming just at this time is the
 greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of
 long sleeves.”
 
mrs. gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
 the course of jane and elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her
 sister slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
 conversation.
 
when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.
 “it seems likely to have been desirable match for jane,” said she. “i
 am sorry it went off. but these things happen so often! young man,
 such as you describe mr. bingley, so easily falls in love with pretty
 girl for few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily
 forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”
 
[illustration:
 
“offended two or three young ladies”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“an excellent consolation in its way,” said elizabeth; “but it will not
 do for _us_. we do not suffer by accident. it does not often happen
 that the interference of friends will persuade young man of
 independent fortune to think more of girl whom was violently in
 love with only few days before.”
 
“but that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so
 doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives very little idea. it is as
 often applied to feelings which arise only from half hour’s
 acquaintance, as to real, strong attachment. pray, how _violent was_
 mr. bingley’s love?”
 
“i never saw more promising inclination; was growing quite
 inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. every time
 they met, it was more decided and remarkable. at his own ball he
 offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and i
 spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. could there be
 finer symptoms? is not general incivility the very essence of love?”
 
“oh, yes! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt. poor
 jane! i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
 over it immediately. it had better have happened to _you_, lizzy; you
 would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. but do you think she would
 be prevailed on to go back with us? change of scene might be of
 service--and perhaps little relief from home may be as useful as
 anything.”
 
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
 of her sister’s ready acquiescence.
 
“i hope,” added mrs. gardiner, “that consideration with regard to
 this young man will influence her. we live in so different part of
 town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
 out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
 unless really comes to see her.”
 
“and _that_ is quite impossible; for is now in the custody of his
 friend, and mr. darcy would more suffer him to call on jane in such a
 part of london! my dear aunt, how could you think of it? mr. darcy may,
 perhaps, have _heard_ of such place as gracechurch street, but he
 would hardly think month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
 impurities, were once to enter it; and, depend upon it, mr. bingley
 never stirs without him.”
 
“so much the better. i hope they will not meet at all. but does not jane
 correspond with his sister? _she_ will not be able to help calling.”
 
“she will drop the acquaintance entirely.”
 
but, in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
 point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley’s being
 withheld from seeing jane, she felt solicitude on the subject which
 convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
 hopeless. it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
 his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
 successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane’s
 attractions.
 
miss bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the
 bingleys were otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she
 hoped, by caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she
 might occasionally spend morning with her, without any danger of
 seeing him.
 
the gardiners stayed week at longbourn; and what with the philipses,
 the lucases, and the officers, there was not day without its
 engagement. mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
 of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to family
 dinner. when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
 made part of it, of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one; and
 on these occasions mrs. gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth’s
 warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. without supposing
 them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
 of each other was plain enough to make her little uneasy; and she
 resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
 hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
 an attachment.
 
to mrs. gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
 unconnected with his general powers. about ten or dozen years ago,
 before her marriage, she had spent considerable time in that very part
 of derbyshire to which belonged. they had, therefore, many
 acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since
 the death of darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power
 to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been
 in the way of procuring.
 
mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr. darcy by
 character perfectly well. here, consequently, was an inexhaustible
 subject of discourse. in comparing her recollection of pemberley with
 the minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her
 tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
 delighting both him and herself. on being made acquainted with the
 present mr. darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
 that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite lad, which might
 agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having
 heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as very proud,
 ill-natured boy.

“will you come and see me?”

chapter xxvi.
 

[illustration]
 
mrs. gardiner’s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
 the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after
 honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--
 
“you are too sensible girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
 are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking
 openly. seriously, i would have you be on your guard. do not involve
 yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of
 fortune would make so very imprudent. i have nothing to say against
 _him_: is most interesting young man; and if had the fortune he
 ought to have, i should think you could not do better. but as it is--you
 must not let your fancy run away with you. you have sense, and we all
 expect you to use it. your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
 good conduct, i am sure. you must not disappoint your father.”
 
“my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”
 
“yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”
 
“well, then, you need not be under any alarm. i will take care of
 myself, and of mr. wickham too. shall not be in love with me, if i
 can prevent it.”
 
“elizabeth, you are not serious now.”
 
“i beg your pardon. i will try again. at present i am not in love with
 mr. wickham; no, i certainly am not. but is, beyond all comparison,
 the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if becomes really attached to
 me--i believe it will be better that should not. i see the imprudence
 of it. oh, _that_ abominable mr. darcy! my father’s opinion of does
 the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it. my
 father, however, is partial to mr. wickham. in short, my dear aunt, i
 should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
 since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are
 seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
 engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many
 of my fellow-creatures, if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that
 it would be wiser to resist? all that i can promise you, therefore, is
 not to be in hurry. i will not be in hurry to believe myself his
 first object. when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing. in
 short, i will do my best.”
 
“perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
 often. at least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”
 
“as i did the other day,” said elizabeth, with conscious smile; “very
 true, it will be wise in to refrain from _that_. but do not imagine
 that is always here so often. it is on your account that has been
 so frequently invited this week. you know my mother’s ideas as to the
 necessity of constant company for her friends. but really, and upon my
 honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now i hope you
 are satisfied.”
 
her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth, having thanked her for
 the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice
 being given on such point without being resented.
 
mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
 by the gardiners and jane; but, as took up his abode with the
 lucases, his arrival was great inconvenience to mrs. bennet. his
 marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned
 as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured
 tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” thursday was to be the
 wedding-day, and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and
 when she rose to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s
 ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,
 accompanied her out of the room. as they went down stairs together,
 charlotte said,--
 
“i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza.”
 
“_that_ you certainly shall.”
 
“and i have another favour to ask. will you come and see me?”
 
“we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire.”
 
“i am not likely to leave kent for some time. promise me, therefore, to
 come to hunsford.”
 
elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
 visit.
 
“my father and maria are to come to in march,” added charlotte, “and
 i hope you will consent to be of the party. indeed, eliza, you will be
 as welcome to as either of them.”
 
the wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
 the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the
 subject as usual. elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their
 correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it
 should be equally unreserved was impossible. elizabeth could never
 address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;
 and, though determined not to slacken as correspondent, it was for the
 sake of what had been rather than what was. charlotte’s first letters
 were received with good deal of eagerness: there could not but be
 curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
 like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
 be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte
 expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. she
 wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
 which she could not praise. the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
 roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine’s behaviour was most
 friendly and obliging. it was mr. collins’s picture of hunsford and
 rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
 for her own visit there, to know the rest.
 
jane had already written few lines to her sister, to announce their
 safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it
 would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.
 
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
 generally is. jane had been week in town, without either seeing or
 hearing from caroline. she accounted for it, however, by supposing that
 her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been
 lost.
 
“my aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the
 town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street.”
 
she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.
 “i did not think caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very
 glad to see me, and reproached for giving her notice of my coming
 to london. i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.
 i inquired after their brother, of course. was well, but so much
 engaged with mr. darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. i found that
 miss darcy was expected to dinner: i wish i could see her. my visit was
 not long, as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out. i dare say i shall
 soon see them here.”
 
elizabeth shook her head over this letter. it convinced her that
 accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sister’s being in town.
 
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him. she endeavoured to
 persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could longer be
 blind to miss bingley’s inattention. after waiting at home every morning
 for fortnight, and inventing every evening fresh excuse for her, the
 visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet
 more, the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself
 longer. the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister
 will prove what she felt:--
 
“my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
 her better judgment, at my expense, when i confess myself to have
 been entirely deceived in miss bingley’s regard for me. but, my
 dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
 obstinate if i still assert that, considering what her behaviour
 was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. i do not at
 all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,
 if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should
 be deceived again. caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
 and not note, not line, did i receive in the meantime. when she
 did come, it was very evident that she had pleasure in it; she
 made slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a
 word of wishing to see again, and was, in every respect, so
 altered creature, that when she went away i was perfectly
 resolved to continue the acquaintance longer. i pity, though i
 cannot help blaming, her. she was very wrong in singling out as
 she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
 her side. but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been
 acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her
 brother is the cause of it. i need not explain myself farther; and
 though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
 feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
 deservedly dear as is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
 feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. i cannot but wonder,
 however, at her having any such fears now, because if had at all
 cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. knows of my
 being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and
 yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
 persuade herself that is really partial to miss darcy. i cannot
 understand it. if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should be
 almost tempted to say, that there is strong appearance of
 duplicity in all this. i will endeavour to banish every painful
 thought, and think only of what will make happy, your affection,
 and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. let hear
 from you very soon. miss bingley said something of his never
 returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
 with any certainty. we had better not mention it. i am extremely
 glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
 hunsford. pray go to see them, with sir william and maria. i am
 sure you will be very comfortable there.
 
“yours, etc.”
 
this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she
 considered that jane would longer be duped, by the sister at least.
 all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. she would not
 even wish for any renewal of his attentions. his character sunk on every
 review of it; and, as punishment for him, as well as possible
 advantage to jane, she seriously hoped might really soon marry mr.
 darcy’s sister, as, by wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly
 regret what had thrown away.
 
mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
 concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had
 such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
 herself. his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
 was the admirer of some one else. elizabeth was watchful enough to
 see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
 her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
 with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
 permitted it. the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
 remarkable charm of the young lady to whom was now rendering himself
 agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
 in charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
 nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to
 suppose that it cost him few struggles to relinquish her, she was
 ready to allow it wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
 sincerely wish him happy.
 
all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner; and, after relating the
 circumstances, she thus went on:--“i am now convinced, my dear aunt,
 that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that
 pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name,
 and wish him all manner of evil. but my feelings are not only cordial
 towards _him_, they are even impartial towards miss king. i cannot find
 out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think
 her very good sort of girl. there can be love in all this. my
 watchfulness has been effectual; and though i should certainly be more
 interesting object to all my acquaintance, were i distractedly in love
 with him, i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance.
 importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. kitty and lydia take
 his defection much more to heart than i do. they are young in the ways
 of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
 handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the
 plain.”

with greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise
 diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and
 sometimes cold, did january and february pass away. march was to take
 elizabeth to hunsford. she had not at first thought very seriously of
 going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the
 plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater
 pleasure as well as greater certainty. absence had increased her desire
 of seeing charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr. collins.
 there was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such mother and such
 uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, little change
 was not unwelcome for its own sake. the journey would, moreover, give
 her peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
 been very sorry for any delay. everything, however, went on smoothly,
 and was finally settled according to charlotte’s first sketch. she was
 to accompany sir william and his second daughter. the improvement of
 spending night in london was added in time, and the plan became as
 perfect as plan could be.
 
the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
 and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
 told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
 
the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly; on
 his side even more. his present pursuit could not make him forget that
 elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
 first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
 of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
 she was to expect in lady catherine bourgh, and trusting their
 opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
 was solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to
 him with most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,
 whether married or single, must always be her model of the amiable
 and pleasing.
 
her fellow-travellers the next day were not of kind to make her think
 him less agreeable. sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a
 good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
 that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
 delight as the rattle of the chaise. elizabeth loved absurdities, but
 she had known sir william’s too long. could tell her nothing new of
 the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
 worn out, like his information.
 
it was journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
 as to be in gracechurch street by noon. as they drove to mr. gardiner’s
 door, jane was at drawing-room window watching their arrival: when
 they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth,
 looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
 lovely as ever. on the stairs were troop of little boys and girls,
 whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to
 wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
 for twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. all was joy and
 kindness. the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
 shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
 
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. their first subject was her
 sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
 her minute inquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her
 spirits, there were periods of dejection. it was reasonable, however, to
 hope that they would not continue long. mrs. gardiner gave her the
 particulars also of miss bingley’s visit in gracechurch street, and
 repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
 herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
 acquaintance.
 
mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham’s desertion, and
 complimented her on bearing it so well.
 
“but, my dear elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is miss king? i
 should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”
 
“pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
 between the mercenary and the prudent motive? where does discretion end,
 and avarice begin? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
 because it would be imprudent; and now, because is trying to get a
 girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that is
 mercenary.”
 
“if you will only tell what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know
 what to think.”
 
“she is very good kind of girl, i believe. i know harm of her.”
 
“but paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death
 made her mistress of this fortune?”
 
“no--why should he? if it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
 affections, because i had money, what occasion could there be for
 making love to girl whom did not care about, and who was equally
 poor?”
 
“but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so
 soon after this event.”
 
“a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
 decorums which other people may observe. if _she_ does not object to it,
 why should _we_?”
 
“_her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. it only shows her being
 deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”
 
“well,” cried elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _he_ shall be
 mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”
 
“no, lizzy, that is what i do _not_ choose. i should be sorry, you know,
 to think ill of young man who has lived so long in derbyshire.”
 
“oh, if that is all, i have very poor opinion of young men who live in
 derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
 much better. i am sick of them all. thank heaven! i am going to-morrow
 where i shall find man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
 neither manners nor sense to recommend him. stupid men are the only ones
 worth knowing, after all.”
 
“take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”
 
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
 unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
 tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
 
“we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said mrs.
 gardiner; “but perhaps, to the lakes.”
 
scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her
 acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “my dear, dear
 aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! you give me
 fresh life and vigour. adieu to disappointment and spleen. what are men
 to rocks and mountains? oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! and
 when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
 being able to give one accurate idea of anything. we _will_ know where
 we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. lakes, mountains,
 and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
 we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
 about its relative situation. let _our_ first effusions be less
 insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”

chapter xxviii.
 

[illustration]
 
every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to
 elizabeth; and her spirits were in state of enjoyment; for she had
 seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
 and the prospect of her northern tour was constant source of delight.
 
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in
 search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
 the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side. elizabeth
 smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
 
at length the parsonage was discernible. the garden sloping to the
 road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,
 everything declared they were arriving. mr. collins and charlotte
 appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which
 led by short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
 the whole party. in moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
 at the sight of each other. mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the
 liveliest pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
 coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. she saw
 instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:
 his formal civility was just what it had been; and detained her some
 minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
 family. they were then, with other delay than his pointing out the
 neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were
 in the parlour, welcomed them second time, with ostentatious
 formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s
 offers of refreshment.
 
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
 fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,
 and its furniture, addressed himself particularly to her, as if
 wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. but though
 everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
 by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,
 that she could have so cheerful an air with such companion. when mr.
 collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
 which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
 charlotte. once or twice she could discern faint blush; but in general
 charlotte wisely did not hear. after sitting long enough to admire
 every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the
 fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
 happened in london, mr. collins invited them to take stroll in the
 garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
 which attended himself. to work in his garden was one of his most
 respectable pleasures; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance
 with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
 owned she encouraged it as much as possible. here, leading the way
 through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
 interval to utter the praises asked for, every view was pointed out
 with minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. could number the
 fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
 the most distant clump. but of all the views which his garden, or which
 the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with
 the prospect of rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that
 bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. it was a
 handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.
 
from his garden, mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows;
 but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of white
 frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte
 took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
 probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s
 help. it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
 was fitted up and arranged with neatness and consistency, of which
 elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit. when mr. collins could be
 forgotten, there was really great air of comfort throughout, and by
 charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed must be often
 forgotten.
 
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country. it
 was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr. collins joining
 in, observed,--
 
“yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
 bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will
 be delighted with her. she is all affability and condescension, and i
 doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
 service is over. i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
 include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
 honours us during your stay here. her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
 charming. we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
 walk home. her ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. i
 _should_ say, one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”
 
“lady catherine is very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added
 charlotte, “and most attentive neighbour.”
 
“very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say. she is the sort of
 woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”
 
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and
 telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
 elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
 charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
 and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
 was all done very well. she had also to anticipate how her visit would
 pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious
 interruptions of mr. collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse
 with rosings. lively imagination soon settled it all.
 
about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
 for walk, sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
 confusion; and, after listening moment, she heard somebody running
 upstairs in violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. she opened
 the door, and met maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with
 agitation, cried out,--
 
[illustration:
 
“in conversation with the ladies”
 
[copyright 1894 by george allen.]]
 
“oh, my dear eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
 there is such sight to be seen! i will not tell you what it is. make
 haste, and come down this moment.”
 
elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more;
 and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest
 of this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in low phaeton at the
 garden gate.
 
“and is this all?” cried elizabeth. “i expected at least that the pigs
 were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
 daughter!”
 
“la! my dear,” said maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not lady
 catherine. the old lady is mrs. jenkinson, who lives with them. the
 other is miss bourgh. only look at her. she is quite little
 creature. who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”
 
“she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
 why does she not come in?”
 
“oh, charlotte says she hardly ever does. it is the greatest of favours
 when miss bourgh comes in.”
 
“i like her appearance,” said elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “she
 looks sickly and cross. yes, she will do for him very well. she will
 make him very proper wife.”
 
mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
 with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth’s high diversion, was
 stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
 before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss bourgh looked that
 way.
 
at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
 the others returned into the house. mr. collins sooner saw the two
 girls than began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
 charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
 to dine at rosings the next day.

chapter xxix.
 

[illustration]
 
mr. collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
 the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
 visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
 wife, was exactly what had wished for; and that an opportunity of
 doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady
 catherine’s condescension as knew not how to admire enough.
 
“i confess,” said he, “that i should not have been at all surprised by
 her ladyship’s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening
 at rosings. i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that
 it would happen. but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?
 who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine
 there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so
 immediately after your arrival?”
 
“i am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied sir william,
 “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
 my situation in life has allowed to acquire. about the court, such
 instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”
 
scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
 visit to rosings. mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what
 they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
 so splendid dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
 
when the ladies were separating for the toilette, said to
 elizabeth,--
 
“do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. lady
 catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
 becomes herself and daughter. i would advise you merely to put on
 whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is occasion
 for anything more. lady catherine will not think the worse of you for
 being simply dressed. she likes to have the distinction of rank
 preserved.”
 
while they were dressing, came two or three times to their different
 doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much
 objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. such formidable accounts of
 her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas,
 who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her
 introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
 to his presentation at st. james’s.
 
as the weather was fine, they had pleasant walk of about half mile
 across the park. every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
 elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
 raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
 slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
 house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
 cost sir lewis bourgh.
 
when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria’s alarm was every moment
 increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm.
 elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. she had heard nothing of lady
 catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
 miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she
 thought she could witness without trepidation.
 
from the entrance hall, of which mr. collins pointed out, with a
 rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
 the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine,
 her daughter, and mrs. jenkinson were sitting. her ladyship, with great
 condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs. collins had settled it
 with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was
 performed in proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
 which would have thought necessary.
 
in spite of having been at st. james’s, sir william was so completely
 awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that had but just courage
 enough to make very low bow, and take his seat without saying word;
 and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
 of her chair, not knowing which way to look. elizabeth found herself
 quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
 composedly. lady catherine was tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
 features, which might once have been handsome. her air was not
 conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
 visitors forget their inferior rank. she was not rendered formidable by
 silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative tone as
 marked her self-importance, and brought mr. wickham immediately to
 elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she
 believed lady catherine to be exactly what had represented.
 
when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
 she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy, she turned her eyes on the
 daughter, she could almost have joined in maria’s astonishment at her
 being so thin and so small. there was neither in figure nor face any
 likeness between the ladies. miss bourgh was pale and sickly: her
 features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
 little, except in low voice, to mrs. jenkinson, in whose appearance
 there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
 to what she said, and placing screen in the proper direction before
 her eyes.
 
after sitting few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
 admire the view, mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties,
 and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
 looking at in the summer.
 
the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
 and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised; and, as he
 had likewise foretold, took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
 her ladyship’s desire, and looked as if felt that life could furnish
 nothing greater. carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;
 and every dish was commended first by him, and then by sir william, who
 was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a
 manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear. but lady
 catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most
 gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved novelty
 to them. the party did not supply much conversation. elizabeth was ready
 to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between
 charlotte and miss bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
 listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not word to her all
 the dinnertime. mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how
 little miss bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and
 fearing she was indisposed. maria thought speaking out of the question,
 and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
 
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
 done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any
 intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
 subject in so decisive manner as proved that she was not used to have
 her judgment controverted. she inquired into charlotte’s domestic
 concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her great deal of advice as
 to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
 regulated in so small family as hers, and instructed her as to the
 care of her cows and her poultry. elizabeth found that nothing was
 beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an
 occasion for dictating to others. in the intervals of her discourse with
 mrs. collins, she addressed variety of questions to maria and
 elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
 the least, and who, she observed to mrs. collins, was very genteel,
 pretty kind of girl. she asked her at different times how many sisters
 she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
 them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
 had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
 mother’s maiden name? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
 questions, but answered them very composedly. lady catherine then
 observed,--
 
“your father’s estate is entailed on mr. collins, i think? for your
 sake,” turning to charlotte, “i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no
 occasion for entailing estates from the female line. it was not thought
 necessary in sir lewis bourgh’s family. do you play and sing, miss
 bennet?”
 
“a little.”
 
“oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. our
 instrument is capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it
 some day. do your sisters play and sing?”
 
“one of them does.”
 
“why did not you all learn? you ought all to have learned. the miss
 webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. do
 you draw?”
 
“no, not at all.”
 
“what, none of you?”
 
“not one.”
 
“that is very strange. but i suppose you had opportunity. your mother
 should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”
 
“my mother would have objection, but my father hates london.”
 
“has your governess left you?”
 
“we never had any governess.”
 
“no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home
 without governess! i never heard of such thing. your mother must
 have been quite slave to your education.”
 
elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
 been the case.
 
“then who taught you? who attended to you? without governess, you must
 have been neglected.”
 
“compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as
 wished to learn never wanted the means. we were always encouraged to
 read, and had all the masters that were necessary. those who chose to be
 idle certainly might.”
 
“ay, doubt: but that is what governess will prevent; and if i had
 known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
 one. i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
 and regular instruction, and nobody but governess can give it. it is
 wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
 way. i am always glad to get young person well placed out. four nieces
 of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
 it was but the other day that i recommended another young person, who
 was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
 delighted with her. mrs. collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe’s
 calling yesterday to thank me? she finds miss pope treasure. ‘lady
 catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given treasure.’ are any of your
 younger sisters out, miss bennet?”
 
“yes, ma’am, all.”
 
“all! what, all five out at once? very odd! and you only the second. the
 younger ones out before the elder are married! your younger sisters must
 be very young?”
 
“yes, my youngest is not sixteen. perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
 in company. but really, ma’am, i think it would be very hard upon
 younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and
 amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
 marry early. the last born has as good right to the pleasures of youth
 as the first. and to be kept back on _such_ motive! i think it would
 not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”
 
“upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly
 for so young person. pray, what is your age?”
 
“with three younger sisters grown up,” replied elizabeth, smiling, “your
 ladyship can hardly expect to own it.”
 
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving direct answer;
 and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
 dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
 
“you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not
 conceal your age.”
 
“i am not one-and-twenty.”
 
when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
 were placed. lady catherine, sir william, and mr. and mrs. collins sat
 down to quadrille; and as miss bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
 two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her
 party. their table was superlatively stupid. scarcely syllable was
 uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs. jenkinson
 expressed her fears of miss bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or
 having too much or too little light. great deal more passed at the
 other table. lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
 of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. mr. collins
 was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
 for every fish won, and apologizing if thought won too many.
 sir william did not say much. was storing his memory with anecdotes
 and noble names.
 
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
 the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to mrs. collins,
 gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. the party then gathered
 round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
 to have on the morrow. from these instructions they were summoned by the
 arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr.
 collins’s side, and as many bows on sir william’s, they departed. as
 soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her
 cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which,
 for charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. but
 her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by means
 satisfy mr. collins, and was very soon obliged to take her ladyship’s
 praise into his own hands.

chapter xxx.

sir william stayed only week at hunsford; but his visit was long
 enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,
 and of her possessing such husband and such neighbour as were not
 often met with. while sir william was with them, mr. collins devoted his
 mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but
 when went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
 and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
 cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast
 and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in
 reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,
 which fronted the road. the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
 the dining parlour for common use; it was better sized room, and had a
 pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
 reason for what she did, for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been
 much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and
 she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.
 
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
 were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
 along, and how often especially miss bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
 which never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
 almost every day. she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had
 few minutes’ conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever
 prevailed on to get out.
 
very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings, and
 not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
 and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
 to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
 hours. now and then they were honoured with call from her ladyship,
 and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
 these visits. she examined into their employments, looked at their work,
 and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
 of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
 accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
 out that mrs. collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.
 
elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the
 commission of the peace for the county, she was most active magistrate
 in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
 mr. collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
 quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
 village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
 them into harmony and plenty.

“he never failed to inform them”

the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice week;
 and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one
 card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
 of the first. their other engagements were few, as the style of living
 of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses’ reach. this,
 however, was evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
 comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
 charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
 had often great enjoyment out of doors. her favourite walk, and where
 she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was
 along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
 nice sheltered path, which one seemed to value but herself, and
 where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine’s curiosity.
 
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
 easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
 addition to the family at rosings, which in so small circle must be
 important. elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that mr. darcy
 was expected there in the course of few weeks; and though there were
 not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
 furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and
 she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley’s designs on him
 were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom was evidently destined
 by lady catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
 satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
 seemed almost angry to find that had already been frequently seen by
 miss lucas and herself.
 
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage; for mr. collins was walking
 the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane,
 in order to have
 
[illustration:
 
“the gentlemen accompanied him.”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage
 turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. on the
 following morning hastened to rosings to pay his respects. there were
 two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for mr. darcy had brought
 with him colonel fitzwilliam, the younger of his uncle, lord ----;
 and, to the great surprise of all the party, when mr. collins returned,
 the gentlemen accompanied him. charlotte had seen them from her
 husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the
 other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--
 
“i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility. mr. darcy would
 never have come so soon to wait upon me.”
 
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment
 before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
 afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. colonel fitzwilliam,
 who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
 address most truly the gentleman. mr. darcy looked just as had been
 used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
 reserve, to mrs. collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
 friend, met her with every appearance of composure. elizabeth merely
 courtesied to him, without saying word.
 
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the
 readiness and ease of well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
 his cousin, after having addressed slight observation on the house and
 garden to mrs. collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
 at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
 elizabeth after the health of her family. she answered him in the usual
 way; and, after moment’s pause, added,--
 
“my eldest sister has been in town these three months. have you never
 happened to see her there?”
 
she was perfectly sensible that never had: but she wished to see
 whether would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
 bingleys and jane; and she thought looked little confused as he
 answered that had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet. the
 subject was pursued further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
 away.

chapter xxxi.

colonel fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
 and the ladies all felt that must add considerably to the pleasure of
 their engagements at rosings. it was some days, however, before they
 received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
 house they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day,
 almost week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by
 such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
 come there in the evening. for the last week they had seen very little
 of either lady catherine or her daughter. colonel fitzwilliam had called
 at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr. darcy they had
 only seen at church.
 
the invitation was accepted, of course, and at proper hour they joined
 the party in lady catherine’s drawing-room. her ladyship received them
 civilly, but it was plain that their company was by means so
 acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
 almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy,
 much more than to any other person in the room.
 
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a
 welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs. collins’s pretty friend had,
 moreover, caught his fancy very much. now seated himself by her, and
 talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
 at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so
 well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
 spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as
 well as of mr. darcy. _his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
 towards them with look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a
 while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
 scruple to call out,--
 
“what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam? what is it you are talking
 of? what are you telling miss bennet? let hear what it is.”
 
“we were talking of music, madam,” said he, when longer able to avoid
 reply.
 
“of music! then pray speak aloud. it is of all subjects my delight. i
 must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.
 there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true
 enjoyment of music than myself, or better natural taste. if i had ever
 learnt, i should have been great proficient. and so would anne, if her
 health had allowed her to apply. i am confident that she would have
 performed delightfully. how does georgiana get on, darcy?”
 
mr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.
 
“i am very glad to hear such good account of her,” said lady
 catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
 if she does not practise great deal.”
 
“i assure you, madam,” replied, “that she does not need such advice.
 she practises very constantly.”
 
“so much the better. it cannot be done too much; and when i next write
 to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. i often
 tell young ladies, that excellence in music is to be acquired without
 constant practice. i have told miss bennet several times, that she will
 never play really well, unless she practises more; and though mrs.
 collins has instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often told
 her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in mrs.
 jenkinson’s room. she would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part
 of the house.”
 
mr. darcy looked little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made
 answer.
 
when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
 promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. he
 drew chair near her. lady catherine listened to half song, and then
 talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
 her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,
 stationed himself so as to command full view of the fair performer’s
 countenance. elizabeth saw what was doing, and at the first
 convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--
 
“you mean to frighten me, mr. darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
 me. but i will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.
 there is stubbornness about that never can bear to be frightened at
 the will of others. my courage always rises with every attempt to
 intimidate me.”
 
“i shall not say that you are mistaken,” replied, “because you could
 not really believe to entertain any design of alarming you; and i
 have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
 find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,
 are not your own.”
 
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
 colonel fitzwilliam, “your cousin will give you very pretty notion of
 me, and teach you not to believe word i say. i am particularly unlucky
 in meeting with person so well able to expose my real character, in a
 part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
 of credit. indeed, mr. darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
 all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me
 leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking to retaliate,
 and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”
 
“i am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.
 
“pray let hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried colonel
 fitzwilliam. “i should like to know how behaves among strangers.”
 
“you shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. the
 first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know, was at
 ball--and at this ball, what do you think did? danced only four
 dances! i am sorry to pain you, but so it was. danced only four
 dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more
 than one young lady was sitting down in want of partner. mr. darcy,
 you cannot deny the fact.”
 
“i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
 beyond my own party.”
 
“true; and nobody can ever be introduced in ball-room. well, colonel
 fitzwilliam, what do i play next? my fingers wait your orders.”
 
“perhaps,” said darcy, “i should have judged better had i sought an
 introduction, but i am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”
 
“shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said elizabeth, still
 addressing colonel fitzwilliam. “shall we ask him why man of sense and
 education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend
 himself to strangers?”
 
“i can answer your question,” said fitzwilliam, “without applying to
 him. it is because will not give himself the trouble.”
 
“i certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said darcy,
 “of conversing easily with those i have never seen before. i cannot
 catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
 concerns, as i often see done.”
 
“my fingers,” said elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the
 masterly manner which i see so many women’s do. they have not the same
 force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. but then i
 have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take
 the trouble of practising. it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers
 as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”
 
darcy smiled and said, “you are perfectly right. you have employed your
 time much better. one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
 think anything wanting. we neither of us perform to strangers.”
 
here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know
 what they were talking of. elizabeth immediately began playing again.
 lady catherine approached, and, after listening for few minutes, said
 to darcy,--
 
“miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
 could have the advantage of london master. she has very good notion
 of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne’s. anne would have
 been delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”
 
elizabeth looked at darcy, to see how cordially assented to his
 cousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
 discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
 bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that might have
 been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.
 
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth’s performance, mixing
 with them many instructions on execution and taste. elizabeth received
 them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
 gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship’s carriage was
 ready to take them all home.

chapter xxxii.
 

[illustration]
 
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane,
 while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village,
 when she was startled by ring at the door, the certain signal of a
 visitor. as she had heard carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
 lady catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her
 half-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,
 when the door opened, and to her very great surprise mr. darcy, and mr.
 darcy only, entered the room.
 
seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his
 intrusion, by letting her know that had understood all the ladies to
 be within.
 
they then sat down, and when her inquiries after rosings were made,
 seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. it was absolutely
 necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency
 recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling
 curious to know what would say on the subject of their hasty
 departure, she observed,--
 
“how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr. darcy!
 it must have been most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you
 all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, went but the day
 before. and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london?”
 
“perfectly so, i thank you.”
 
she found that she was to receive other answer; and, after short
 pause, added,--
 
“i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever
 returning to netherfield again?”
 
“i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that may spend
 very little of his time there in future. has many friends, and is
 at time of life when friends and engagements are continually
 increasing.”
 
“if means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the
 neighbourhood that should give up the place entirely, for then we
 might possibly get settled family there. but, perhaps, mr. bingley did
 not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
 for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
 principle.”
 
“i should not be surprised,” said darcy, “if were to give it up as
 soon as any eligible purchase offers.”
 
elizabeth made answer. she was afraid of talking longer of his
 friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
 trouble of finding subject to him.
 
took the hint and soon began with, “this seems very comfortable
 house. lady catherine, i believe, did great deal to it when mr.
 collins first came to hunsford.”
 
“i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her
 kindness on more grateful object.”
 
“mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of wife.”
 
“yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
 the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
 him happy if they had. my friend has an excellent understanding--though
 i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest
 thing she ever did. she seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a
 prudential light, it is certainly very good match for her.”
 
“it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
 distance of her own family and friends.”
 
“an easy distance do you call it? it is nearly fifty miles.”
 
“and what is fifty miles of good road? little more than half day’s
 journey. yes, i call it very easy distance.”
 
“i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
 of the match,” cried elizabeth. “i should never have said mrs. collins
 was settled _near_ her family.”
 
“it is proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire. anything beyond
 the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far.”
 
as spoke there was sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she
 understood; must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
 netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--
 
“i do not mean to say that woman may not be settled too near her
 family. the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
 varying circumstances. where there is fortune to make the expense of
 travelling unimportant, distance becomes evil. but that is not the
 case _here_. mr. and mrs. collins have comfortable income, but not
 such one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my
 friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
 the present distance.”
 
mr. darcy drew his chair little towards her, and said, “_you_ cannot
 have right to such very strong local attachment. _you_ cannot have
 been always at longbourn.”
 
elizabeth looked surprised. the gentleman experienced some change of
 feeling; drew back his chair, took newspaper from the table, and,
 glancing over it, said, in colder voice,--
 
“are you pleased with kent?”
 
short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
 calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
 and her sister, just returned from their walk. the _tête-à-tête_
 surprised them. mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his
 intruding on miss bennet, and, after sitting few minutes longer,
 without saying much to anybody, went away.
 
[illustration: “accompanied by their aunt”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“what can be the meaning of this?” said charlotte, as soon as was
 gone. “my dear eliza, must be in love with you, or would never
 have called on us in this familiar way.”
 
but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
 even to charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various
 conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
 the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
 from the time of year. all field sports were over. within doors there
 was lady catherine, books, and billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
 always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the
 pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
 two cousins found temptation from this period of walking thither
 almost every day. they called at various times of the morning, sometimes
 separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
 aunt. it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
 had pleasure in their society, persuasion which of course recommended
 him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
 being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former
 favourite, george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there
 was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam’s manners, she
 believed might have the best informed mind.
 
but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult
 to understand. it could not be for society, as frequently sat there
 ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when did speak, it
 seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
 propriety, not pleasure to himself. seldom appeared really
 animated. mrs. collins knew not what to make of him. colonel
 fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that was
 generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
 her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
 love, and the object of that love her friend eliza, she set herself
 seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at
 rosings, and whenever came to hunsford; but without much success. he
 certainly looked at her friend great deal, but the expression of that
 look was disputable. it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
 doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
 seemed nothing but absence of mind.
 
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
 being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs.
 collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
 raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
 opinion it admitted not of doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would
 vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.
 
in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
 colonel fitzwilliam. was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he
 certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
 to counterbalance these advantages, mr. darcy had considerable patronage
 in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.

more than once did elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
 unexpectedly meet mr. darcy. she felt all the perverseness of the
 mischance that should bring him where one else was brought; and, to
 prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,
 that it was favourite haunt of hers. how it could occur second time,
 therefore, was very odd! yet it did, and even the third. it seemed like
 wilful ill-nature, or voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was
 not merely few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
 but actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. he
 never said great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
 or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
 encounter that was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her
 pleasure in being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
 opinion of mr. and mrs. collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of
 rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, seemed to
 expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying
 _there_ too. his words seemed to imply it. could have colonel
 fitzwilliam in his thoughts? she supposed, if meant anything, must
 mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. it distressed her
 little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
 pales opposite the parsonage.
 
she was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing jane’s last
 letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not
 written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy,
 she saw, on looking up, that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her.
 putting away the letter immediately, and forcing smile, she said,--
 
“i did not know before that you ever walked this way.”
 
“i have been making the tour of the park,” replied, “as i generally
 do every year, and intended to close it with call at the parsonage.
 are you going much farther?”
 
“no, i should have turned in moment.”
 
and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage
 together.
 
“do you certainly leave kent on saturday?” said she.
 
“yes--if darcy does not put it off again. but i am at his disposal. he
 arranges the business just as pleases.”
 
“and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, has at least
 great pleasure in the power of choice. i do not know anybody who seems
 more to enjoy the power of doing what likes than mr. darcy.”
 
“he likes to have his own way very well,” replied colonel fitzwilliam.
 “but so we all do. it is only that has better means of having it than
 many others, because is rich, and many others are poor. i speak
 feelingly. younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
 dependence.”
 
“in my opinion, the younger of an earl can know very little of
 either. now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
 dependence? when have you been prevented by want of money from going
 wherever you chose or procuring anything you had fancy for?”
 
“these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have
 experienced many hardships of that nature. but in matters of greater
 weight, i may suffer from the want of money. younger sons cannot marry
 where they like.”
 
“unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often
 do.”
 
“our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in
 my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
 money.”
 
“is this,” thought elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the
 idea; but, recovering herself, said in lively tone, “and pray, what is
 the usual price of an earl’s younger son? unless the elder brother is
 very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”
 
answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. to interrupt
 silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
 she soon afterwards said,--
 
“i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
 having somebody at his disposal. i wonder does not marry, to secure a
 lasting convenience of that kind. but, perhaps, his sister does as well
 for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, may do what he
 likes with her.”
 
“no,” said colonel fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which must
 divide with me. i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy.”
 
“are you, indeed? and pray what sort of guardian do you make? does
 your charge give you much trouble? young ladies of her age are sometimes
 little difficult to manage; and if she has the true darcy spirit, she
 may like to have her own way.”
 
as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
 in which immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
 give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
 got pretty near the truth. she directly replied,--
 
“you need not be frightened. i never heard any harm of her; and i dare
 say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. she is a
 very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs. hurst and
 miss bingley. i think i have heard you say that you know them.”
 
“i know them little. their brother is pleasant, gentlemanlike
 man--he is great friend of darcy’s.”
 
“oh yes,” said elizabeth drily--“mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr.
 bingley, and takes prodigious deal of care of him.”
 
“care of him! yes, i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in
 those points where most wants care. from something that told me
 in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted
 to him. but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have right to suppose
 that bingley was the person meant. it was all conjecture.”
 
“what is it you mean?”
 
“it is circumstance which darcy of course could not wish to be
 generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it
 would be an unpleasant thing.”
 
“you may depend upon my not mentioning it.”
 
“and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
 bingley. what told was merely this: that congratulated himself
 on having lately saved friend from the inconveniences of most
 imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
 particulars; and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him
 the kind of young man to get into scrape of that sort, and from
 knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”
 
“did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”
 
“i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
 lady.”
 
“and what arts did use to separate them?”
 
“he did not talk to of his own arts,” said fitzwilliam, smiling. “he
 only told what i have now told you.”
 
elizabeth made answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
 indignation. after watching her little, fitzwilliam asked her why she
 was so thoughtful.
 
“i am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “your
 cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. why was to be the
 judge?”
 
“you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”
 
“i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
 friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, was to
 determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. but,”
 she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the
 particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. it is not to be supposed
 that there was much affection in the case.”
 
“that is not an unnatural surmise,” said fitzwilliam; “but it is
 lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”
 
this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just picture of
 mr. darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
 therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
 matters till they reached the parsonage. there, shut into her own room,
 as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
 of all that she had heard. it was not to be supposed that any other
 people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. there
 could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom mr. darcy could have
 such boundless influence. that had been concerned in the measures
 taken to separate mr. bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she
 had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and
 arrangement of them. if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
 _he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that
 jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. had ruined for a
 while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
 in the world; and one could say how lasting an evil might have
 inflicted.
 
“there were some very strong objections against the lady,” were colonel
 fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her
 having one uncle who was country attorney, and another who was in
 business in london.
 
“to jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be possibility of
 objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! her understanding
 excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. neither could
 anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
 peculiarities, has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain,
 and respectability which will probably never reach.” when she thought
 of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way little; but she would
 not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr.
 darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive deeper wound from
 the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want
 of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that had been partly
 governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
 retaining mr. bingley for his sister.
 
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a
 headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
 her unwillingness to see mr. darcy, it determined her not to attend her
 cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. mrs. collins,
 seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
 as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but mr. collins
 could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine’s being rather
 displeased by her staying at home.

when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
 much as possible against mr. darcy, chose for her employment the
 examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
 being in kent. they contained actual complaint, nor was there any
 revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
 but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was want of that
 cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
 proceeding from the serenity of mind at ease with itself, and kindly
 disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. elizabeth
 noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
 attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. mr. darcy’s
 shameful boast of what misery had been able to inflict gave her a
 keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. it was some consolation to
 think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next,
 and still greater that in less than fortnight she should herself be
 with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
 spirits, by all that affection could do.
 
she could not think of darcy’s leaving kent without remembering that his
 cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
 that had intentions at all, and, agreeable as was, she did not
 mean to be unhappy about him.
 
while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
 door-bell; and her spirits were little fluttered by the idea of its
 being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
 the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. but
 this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
 affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr. darcy walk into the
 room. in hurried manner immediately began an inquiry after her
 health, imputing his visit to wish of hearing that she were better.
 she answered him with cold civility. sat down for few moments, and
 then getting up walked about the room. elizabeth was surprised, but
 said not word. after silence of several minutes, came towards her
 in an agitated manner, and thus began:--
 
“in vain have i struggled. it will not do. my feelings will not be
 repressed. you must allow to tell you how ardently i admire and love
 you.”
 
elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. she stared, coloured,
 doubted, and was silent. this considered sufficient encouragement,
 and the avowal of all that felt and had long felt for her immediately
 followed. spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the
 heart to be detailed, and was not more eloquent on the subject of
 tenderness than of pride. his sense of her inferiority, of its being a
 degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed
 to inclination, were dwelt on with warmth which seemed due to the
 consequence was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
 suit.
 
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
 the compliment of such man’s affection, and though her intentions did
 not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain was to
 receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
 all compassion in anger. she tried, however, to compose herself to
 answer him with patience, when should have done. concluded with
 representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of
 all his endeavours had found impossible to conquer; and with
 expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
 his hand. as said this she could easily see that had doubt of a
 favourable answer. _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
 countenance expressed real security. such circumstance could only
 exasperate farther; and when ceased the colour rose into her cheeks
 and she said,--
 
“in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to
 express sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
 unequally they may be returned. it is natural that obligation should be
 felt, and if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you. but i
 cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
 bestowed it most unwillingly. i am sorry to have occasioned pain to
 anyone. it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be
 of short duration. the feelings which you tell have long prevented
 the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in
 overcoming it after this explanation.”
 
mr. darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed
 on her face, seemed to catch her words with less resentment than
 surprise. his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
 his mind was visible in every feature. was struggling for the
 appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till believed
 himself to have attained it. the pause was to elizabeth’s feelings
 dreadful. at length, in voice of forced calmness, said,--
 
“and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting! i
 might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
 civility, i am thus rejected. but it is of small importance.”
 
“i might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident design
 of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell that you liked me
 against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
 was not this some excuse for incivility, if i _was_ uncivil? but i have
 other provocations. you know i have. had not my own feelings decided
 against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
 favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt to accept
 the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
 happiness of most beloved sister?”
 
as she pronounced these words, mr. darcy changed colour; but the emotion
 was short, and listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
 continued,--
 
“i have every reason in the world to think ill of you. motive can
 excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. you dare not,
 you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
 of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
 world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
 disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
 kind.”
 
she paused, and saw with slight indignation that was listening
 with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
 even looked at her with smile of affected incredulity.
 
“can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.
 
with assumed tranquillity then replied, “i have wish of denying
 that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
 sister, or that i rejoice in my success. towards _him_ i have been
 kinder than towards myself.”
 
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
 but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
 
“but it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike
 is founded. long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
 decided. your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
 many months ago from mr. wickham. on this subject, what can you have to
 say? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
 or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”
 
“you take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said darcy,
 in less tranquil tone, and with heightened colour.
 
“who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an
 interest in him?”
 
“his misfortunes!” repeated darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his
 misfortunes have been great indeed.”
 
“and of your infliction,” cried elizabeth, with energy; “you have
 reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. you
 have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed
 for him. you have deprived the best years of his life of that
 independence which was less his due than his desert. you have done
 all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with
 contempt and ridicule.”
 
“and this,” cried darcy, as walked with quick steps across the room,
 “is your opinion of me! this is the estimation in which you hold me! i
 thank you for explaining it so fully. my faults, according to this
 calculation, are heavy indeed! but, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his
 walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been
 overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
 scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. these
 bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i, with greater
 policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my
 being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
 reflection, by everything. but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
 nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related. they were natural and just.
 could you expect to rejoice in the inferiority of your
 connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose
 condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”
 
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
 the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--
 
“you are mistaken, mr. darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
 declaration affected in any other way than as it spared the
 concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
 more gentlemanlike manner.”
 
she saw him start at this; but said nothing, and she continued,--
 
“you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way
 that would have tempted to accept it.”
 
again his astonishment was obvious; and looked at her with an
 expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. she went on,--
 
“from the very beginning, from the first moment, i may almost say, of my
 acquaintance with you, your manners impressing with the fullest
 belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
 feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of
 disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
 dislike; and i had not known you month before i felt that you were the
 last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry.”
 
“you have said quite enough, madam. i perfectly comprehend your
 feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
 forgive for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
 wishes for your health and happiness.”
 
and with these words hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him
 the next moment open the front door and quit the house. the tumult of
 her mind was now painfully great. she knew not how to support herself,
 and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. her
 astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by
 every review of it. that she should receive an offer of marriage from
 mr. darcy! that should have been in love with her for so many months!
 so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections
 which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which
 must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost
 incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong
 an affection. but his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal
 of what had done with respect to jane, his unpardonable assurance in
 acknowledging, though could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner
 which had mentioned mr. wickham, his cruelty towards whom had not
 attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his
 attachment had for moment excited.
 
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady
 catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
 charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.

chapter xxxv.
 

[illustration]
 
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
 which had at length closed her eyes. she could not yet recover from the
 surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything
 else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
 breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. she was proceeding
 directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr. darcy’s
 sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
 she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. the
 park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
 of the gates into the ground.
 
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
 tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
 look into the park. the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had
 made great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
 verdure of the early trees. she was on the point of continuing her
 walk, when she caught glimpse of gentleman within the sort of grove
 which edged the park: was moving that way; and fearful of its being
 mr. darcy, she was directly retreating. but the person who advanced was
 now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,
 pronounced her name. she had turned away; but on hearing herself called,
 though in voice which proved it to be mr. darcy, she moved again
 towards the gate. had by that time reached it also; and, holding out
 letter, which she instinctively took, said, with look of haughty
 composure, “i have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of
 meeting you. will you do the honour of reading that letter?” and
 then, with slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon
 out of sight.
 
with expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
 elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
 perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
 quite through, in very close hand. the envelope itself was likewise
 full. pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. it was dated
 from rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--
 
“be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of
 its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those
 offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. i write without any
 intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,
 which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
 effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
 should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
 and read. you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand
 your attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i
 demand it of your justice.
 
“two offences of very different nature, and by means of equal
 magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. the first mentioned was,
 that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached mr. bingley
 from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in defiance of various
 claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
 prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham. wilfully and
 wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
 favourite of my father, young man who had scarcely any other
 dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
 its exertion, would be depravity, to which the separation of two young
 persons whose affection could be the growth of only few weeks, could
 bear comparison. but from the severity of that blame which was last
 night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope
 to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and
 their motives has been read. if, in the explanation of them which is due
 to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be
 offensive to yours, i can only say that i am sorry. the necessity must
 be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. i had not been long in
 hertfordshire before i saw, in common with others, that bingley
 preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. but
 it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any
 apprehension of his feeling serious attachment. i had often seen him
 in love before. at that ball, while i had the honour of dancing with
 you, i was first made acquainted, by sir william lucas’s accidental
 information, that bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to
 general expectation of their marriage. spoke of it as certain
 event, of which the time alone could be undecided. from that moment i
 observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive
 that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed
 in him. your sister i also watched. her look and manners were open,
 cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar
 regard; and i remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that
 though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite
 them by any participation of sentiment. if _you_ have not been mistaken
 here, _i_ must have been in an error. your superior knowledge of your
 sister must make the latter probable. if it be so, if i have been misled
 by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
 unreasonable. but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of
 your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most
 acute observer conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart
 was not likely to be easily touched. that i was desirous of believing
 her indifferent is certain; but i will venture to say that my
 investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or
 fears. i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it; i
 believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason.
 my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night
 acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside
 in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
 my friend as to me. but there were other causes of repugnance; causes
 which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both
 instances, i had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not
 immediately before me. these causes must be stated, though briefly. the
 situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in
 comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost
 uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and
 occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains to offend
 you. but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,
 and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
 consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid
 any share of the like censure is praise less generally bestowed on
 you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and
 disposition of both. i will only say, farther, that from what passed
 that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every
 inducement heightened, which could have led before to preserve my
 friend from what i esteemed most unhappy connection. left
 netherfield for london on the day following, as you, i am certain,
 remember, with the design of soon returning. the part which i acted is
 now to be explained. his sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited
 with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike
 sensible that time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we
 shortly resolved on joining him directly in london. we accordingly
 went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my
 friend the certain evils of such choice. i described and enforced them
 earnestly. but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed
 his determination, i do not suppose that it would ultimately have
 prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which
 i hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. had before
 believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,
 regard. but bingley has great natural modesty, with stronger
 dependence on my judgment than on his own. to convince him, therefore,
 that had deceived himself was very difficult point. to persuade
 him against returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been
 given, was scarcely the work of moment. i cannot blame myself for
 having done thus much. there is but one part of my conduct, in the whole
 affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that i
 condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him
 your sister’s being in town. i knew it myself, as it was known to miss
 bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. that they might
 have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard
 did not appear to enough extinguished for him to see her without some
 danger. perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. it is
 done, however, and it was done for the best. on this subject i have
 nothing more to say, other apology to offer. if i have wounded your
 sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
 governed may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have not
 yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other, more weighty
 accusation, of having injured mr. wickham, i can only refute it by
 laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. of what he
 has _particularly_ accused i am ignorant; but of the truth of what i
 shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.
 mr. wickham is the of very respectable man, who had for many years
 the management of all the pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in
 the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service
 to him; and on george wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was
 therefore liberally bestowed. my father supported him at school, and
 afterwards at cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,
 always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to
 give him gentleman’s education. my father was not only fond of this
 young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, had also the
 highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,
 intended to provide for him in it. as for myself, it is many, many years
 since i first began to think of him in very different manner. the
 vicious propensities, the want of principle, which was careful to
 guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the
 observation of young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who
 had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr. darcy
 could not have. here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you
 only can tell. but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has
 created, suspicion of their nature shall not prevent from unfolding
 his real character. it adds even another motive. my excellent father
 died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the
 last so steady, that in his will particularly recommended it to to
 promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might
 allow, and if took orders, desired that valuable family living
 might be his as soon as it became vacant. there was also legacy of
 one thousand pounds. his own father did not long survive mine; and
 within half year from these events mr. wickham wrote to inform me
 that, having finally resolved against taking orders, hoped i should
 not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate
 pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which could not be
 benefited. had some intention, added, of studying the law, and i
 must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be very
 insufficient support therein. i rather wished than believed him to be
 sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his
 proposal. i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be clergyman. the
 business was therefore soon settled. resigned all claim to assistance
 in the church, were it possible that could ever be in situation to
 receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. all connection
 between us seemed now dissolved. i thought too ill of him to invite him
 to pemberley, or admit his society in town. in town, i believe, he
 chiefly lived, but his studying the law was mere pretence; and being
 now free from all restraint, his life was life of idleness and
 dissipation. for about three years i heard little of him; but on the
 decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,
 applied to again by letter for the presentation. his
 circumstances, assured me, and i had difficulty in believing it,
 were exceedingly bad. had found the law most unprofitable study,
 and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would present
 him to the living in question--of which trusted there could be little
 doubt, as was well assured that i had other person to provide for,
 and i could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. you will
 hardly blame for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
 resisting every repetition of it. his resentment was in proportion to
 the distress of his circumstances--and was doubtless as violent in
 his abuse of to others as in his reproaches to myself. after this
 period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. how lived, i
 know not. but last summer was again most painfully obtruded on my
 notice. i must now mention circumstance which i would wish to forget
 myself, and which obligation less than the present should induce me
 to unfold to any human being. having said thus much, i feel doubt of
 your secrecy. my sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left
 to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, colonel fitzwilliam, and
 myself. about year ago, she was taken from school, and an
 establishment formed for her in london; and last summer she went with
 the lady who presided over it to ramsgate; and thither also went mr.
 wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been prior
 acquaintance between him and mrs. younge, in whose character we were
 most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid so far
 recommended himself to georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a
 strong impression of his kindness to her as child, that she was
 persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. she
 was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
 imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to
 herself. i joined them unexpectedly day or two before the intended
 elopement; and then georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving
 and offending brother whom she almost looked up to as father,
 acknowledged the whole to me. you may imagine what i felt and how i
 acted. regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public
 exposure; but i wrote to mr. wickham, who left the place immediately,
 and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge. mr. wickham’s
 chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty
 thousand pounds; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging
 himself on was strong inducement. his revenge would have been
 complete indeed. this, madam, is faithful narrative of every event in
 which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely
 reject it as false, you will, i hope, acquit henceforth of cruelty
 towards mr. wickham. i know not in what manner, under what form of
 falsehood, has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be
 wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning
 either. detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly
 not in your inclination. you may possibly wonder why all this was not
 told you last night. but i was not then master enough of myself to know
 what could or ought to be revealed. for the truth of everything here
 related, i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel
 fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and
 still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been
 unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. if
 your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you
 cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and
 that there may be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour
 to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the
 course of the morning. i will only add, god bless you.
 
“fitzwilliam darcy.”

chapter xxxvi.

elizabeth, when mr. darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
 contain renewal of his offers, she had formed expectation at all of
 its contents. but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
 she went through them, and what contrariety of emotion they excited.
 her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. with amazement did
 she first understand that believed any apology to be in his power;
 and steadfastly was she persuaded, that could have explanation to
 give, which just sense of shame would not conceal. with strong
 prejudice against everything might say, she began his account of
 what had happened at netherfield. she read with an eagerness which
 hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing
 what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
 sense of the one before her eyes. his belief of her sister’s
 insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the
 real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any
 wish of doing him justice. expressed regret for what had done
 which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. it was all
 pride and insolence.
 
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham--when
 she read, with somewhat clearer attention, relation of events which,
 if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
 bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings
 were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
 astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. she wished
 to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “this must be false!
 this cannot be! this must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had
 gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
 last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
 regard it, that she would never look in it again.
 
in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
 nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half minute the letter
 was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she
 again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and
 commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
 the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly
 what had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy,
 though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
 own words. so far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to
 the will, the difference was great. what wickham had said of the living
 was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was
 impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
 other, and, for few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
 not err. but when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the
 particulars immediately following of wickham’s resigning all pretensions
 to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable sum as three
 thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. she put down the
 letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
 impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
 little success. on both sides it was only assertion. again she read on.
 but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
 believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
 render mr. darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
 turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.
 
the extravagance and general profligacy which scrupled not to lay to
 mr. wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
 bring proof of its injustice. she had never heard of him before his
 entrance into the ----shire militia, in which had engaged at the
 persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
 had there renewed slight acquaintance. of his former way of life,
 nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what told
 
[illustration:

himself. as to his real character, had information been in her power,
 she had never felt wish of inquiring. his countenance, voice, and
 manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.
 she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished
 trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the
 attacks of mr. darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone
 for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what
 mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’
 continuance. but such recollection befriended her. she could see him
 instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could
 remember more substantial good than the general approbation of the
 neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in
 the mess. after pausing on this point considerable while, she once
 more continued to read. but, alas! the story which followed, of his
 designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed
 between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at
 last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel
 fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the
 information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose
 character she had reason to question. at one time she had almost
 resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness
 of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that
 mr. darcy would never have hazarded such proposal, if had not been
 well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.
 
she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
 between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr. philips’s.
 many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. she was _now_
 struck with the impropriety of such communications to stranger, and
 wondered it had escaped her before. she saw the indelicacy of putting
 himself forward as had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
 with his conduct. she remembered that had boasted of having fear
 of seeing mr. darcy--that mr. darcy might leave the country, but that
 _he_ should stand his ground; yet had avoided the netherfield ball
 the very next week. she remembered, also, that till the netherfield
 family had quitted the country, had told his story to one but
 herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;
 that had then reserves, scruples in sinking mr. darcy’s
 character, though had assured her that respect for the father would
 always prevent his exposing the son.
 
how differently did everything now appear in which was concerned! his
 attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
 hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved longer
 the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
 his behaviour to herself could now have had tolerable motive: had
 either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
 his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
 incautiously shown. every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
 and fainter; and in further justification of mr. darcy, she could not
 but allow that mr. bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago
 asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as
 were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
 acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
 together, and given her sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
 that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
 of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections was
 esteemed and valued;--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a
 brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
 sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his
 actions been what wickham represented them, so gross violation of
 everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
 that friendship between person capable of it and such an amiable man
 as mr. bingley was incomprehensible.
 
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself. of neither darcy nor wickham
 could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
 prejudiced, absurd.
 
“how despicably have i acted!” she cried. “i, who have prided myself on
 my discernment! i, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
 often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
 vanity in useless or blameless distrust. how humiliating is this
 discovery! yet, how just humiliation! had i been in love, i could not
 have been more wretchedly blind. but vanity, not love, has been my
 folly. pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
 of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted
 prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were
 concerned. till this moment, i never knew myself.”
 
from herself to jane, from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in line
 which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy’s explanation
 _there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. widely
 different was the effect of second perusal. how could she deny that
 credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
 give in the other? declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious
 of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what
 charlotte’s opinion had always been. neither could she deny the justice
 of his description of jane. she felt that jane’s feelings, though
 fervent, were little displayed, and that there was constant
 complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
 sensibility.
 
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
 mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense
 of shame was severe. the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
 for denial; and the circumstances to which particularly alluded, as
 having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
 disapprobation, could not have made stronger impression on his mind
 than on hers.
 
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. it soothed, but
 it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
 self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that
 jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest
 relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
 by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
 had ever known before.
 
after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
 variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and
 reconciling herself, as well as she could, to change so sudden and so
 important, fatigue, and recollection of her long absence, made her at
 length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing
 cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as
 must make her unfit for conversation.
 
she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
 called during her absence; mr. darcy, only for few minutes, to take
 leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
 an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
 till she could be found. elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
 missing him; she really rejoiced at it. colonel fitzwilliam was no
 longer an object. she could think only of her letter.
 



[illustration:
 
“his parting obeisance”
 ]
 



chapter xxxvii.
 

[illustration]
 
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr. collins having
 been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
 able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very
 good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
 melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings. to rosings then
 hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter; and on his return
 brought back, with great satisfaction, message from her ladyship,
 importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
 having them all to dine with her.
 
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that, had
 she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her
 future niece; nor could she think, without smile, of what her
 ladyship’s indignation would have been. “what would she have said? how
 would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused
 herself.
 
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings’ party. “i assure
 you, i feel it exceedingly,” said lady catherine; “i believe nobody
 feels the loss of friends so much as i do. but i am particularly
 attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!
 they were excessively sorry to go! but so they always are. the dear
 colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy
 seemed to feel it most acutely--more, i think, than last year. his
 attachment to rosings certainly increases.”
 
mr. collins had compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which
 were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
 
lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of
 spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
 she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--
 
“but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
 may stay little longer. mrs. collins will be very glad of your
 company, i am sure.”
 
“i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied
 elizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. i must be in town
 next saturday.”
 
“why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. i expected
 you to stay two months. i told mrs. collins so before you came. there
 can be occasion for your going so soon. mrs. bennet could certainly
 spare you for another fortnight.”
 
“but my father cannot. wrote last week to hurry my return.”
 
[illustration:
 
“dawson”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.
 daughters are never of so much consequence to father. and if you will
 stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you
 as far as london, for i am going there early in june, for week; and
 as dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good
 room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be
 cool, i should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you
 large.”
 
“you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our
 original plan.”
 
lady catherine seemed resigned. “mrs. collins, you must send servant
 with them. you know i always speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea
 of two young women travelling post by themselves. it is highly improper.
 you must contrive to send somebody. i have the greatest dislike in the
 world to that sort of thing. young women should always be properly
 guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. when my
 niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made point of her
 having two men-servants go with her. miss darcy, the daughter of mr.
 darcy of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with
 propriety in different manner. i am excessively attentive to all those
 things. you must send john with the young ladies, mrs. collins. i am
 glad it occurred to to mention it; for it would really be
 discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”
 
“my uncle is to send servant for us.”
 
“oh! your uncle! keeps man-servant, does he? i am very glad you
 have somebody who thinks of those things. where shall you change horses?
 oh, bromley, of course. if you mention my name at the bell, you will be
 attended to.”
 
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;
 and as she did not answer them all herself attention was
 necessary--which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a
 mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. reflection
 must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave
 way to it as the greatest relief; and not day went by without a
 solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of
 unpleasant recollections.
 
mr. darcy’s letter she was in fair way of soon knowing by heart. she
 studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
 times widely different. when she remembered the style of his address,
 she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly
 she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
 herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
 his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she
 could not approve him; nor could she for moment repent her refusal, or
 feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. in her own past
 behaviour, there was constant source of vexation and regret: and in
 the unhappy defects of her family, subject of yet heavier chagrin.
 they were hopeless of remedy. her father, contented with laughing at
 them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
 youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
 herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. elizabeth had frequently
 united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
 and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,
 what chance could there be of improvement? catherine, weak-spirited,
 irritable, and completely under lydia’s guidance, had been always
 affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would
 scarcely give them hearing. they were ignorant, idle, and vain. while
 there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
 meryton was within walk of longbourn, they would be going there for
 ever.
 
anxiety on jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and mr. darcy’s
 explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion,
 heightened the sense of what jane had lost. his affection was proved to
 have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
 could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. how
 grievous then was the thought that, of situation so desirable in every
 respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had
 been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
 
when to these recollections was added the development of wickham’s
 character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
 seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it
 almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
 
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
 her stay as they had been at first. the very last evening was spent
 there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
 their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
 and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
 way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
 work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
 
when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them
 good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year;
 and miss bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out
 her hand to both.

“the elevation of his feelings.”

chapter xxxviii.
 

[illustration]
 
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast few
 minutes before the others appeared; and took the opportunity of
 paying the parting civilities which deemed indispensably necessary.
 
“i know not, miss elizabeth,” said he, “whether mrs. collins has yet
 expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but i am very
 certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
 it. the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you. we know
 how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. our plain
 manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
 see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to young lady like
 yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
 and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending
 your time unpleasantly.”
 
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. she had
 spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
 charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel
 the obliged. mr. collins was gratified; and with more smiling
 solemnity replied,--
 
“it gives the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
 time not disagreeably. we have certainly done our best; and most
 fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
 society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of
 varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that
 your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. our situation
 with regard to lady catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of
 extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. you see on
 what footing we are. you see how continually we are engaged there. in
 truth, i must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this
 humble parsonage, i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of
 compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings.”
 
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and was
 obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility
 and truth in few short sentences.
 
“you may, in fact, carry very favourable report of us into
 hertfordshire, my dear cousin. i flatter myself, at least, that you will
 be able to do so. lady catherine’s great attentions to mrs. collins you
 have been daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear
 that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
 as well to be silent. only let assure you, my dear miss elizabeth,
 that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
 marriage. my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
 thinking. there is in everything most remarkable resemblance of
 character and ideas between us. we seem to have been designed for each
 other.”
 
elizabeth could safely say that it was great happiness where that was
 the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
 and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. she was not sorry, however, to
 have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
 whom they sprang. poor charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such
 society! but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently
 regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for
 compassion. her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,
 and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
 
at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
 placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. after an affectionate
 parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
 mr. collins; and as they walked down the garden, was commissioning
 her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
 for the kindness had received at longbourn in the winter, and his
 compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner, though unknown. then handed
 her in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
 when suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
 hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings.
 
[illustration:
 
“they had forgotten to leave any message”
 ]
 
“but,” added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects
 delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
 while you have been here.”
 
elizabeth made objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and
 the carriage drove off.
 
“good gracious!” cried maria, after few minutes’ silence, “it seems
 but day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
 happened!”
 
“a great many indeed,” said her companion, with sigh.
 
“we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
 how much i shall have to tell!”
 
elizabeth privately added, “and how much i shall have to conceal!”
 
their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
 within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr. gardiner’s
 house, where they were to remain few days.
 
jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
 spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
 had reserved for them. but jane was to go home with her, and at
 longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
 
it was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
 longbourn, before she told her sister of mr. darcy’s proposals. to know
 that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
 jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
 vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such temptation
 to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
 in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,
 and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
 repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister
 further.

“how nicely we are crammed in”

chapter xxxix.
 

[illustration]
 
it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out
 together from gracechurch street for the town of ----, in hertfordshire;
 and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet’s carriage was
 to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s
 punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of dining-room upstairs.
 these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
 in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
 dressing salad and cucumber.
 
after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed table set
 out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
 “is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”
 
“and we mean to treat you all,” added lydia; “but you must lend us the
 money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” then showing
 her purchases,--“look here, i have bought this bonnet. i do not think it
 is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not. i shall
 pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any
 better.”
 
and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
 unconcern, “oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
 when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i
 think it will be very tolerable. besides, it will not much signify what
 one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they
 are going in fortnight.”
 
“are they, indeed?” cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
 
“they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to
 take us all there for the summer! it would be such delicious scheme,
 and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all. mamma would like to
 go, too, of all things! only think what miserable summer else we shall
 have!”
 
“yes,” thought elizabeth; “_that_ would be delightful scheme, indeed,
 and completely do for us at once. good heaven! brighton and whole
 campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
 regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton!”
 
“now i have got some news for you,” said lydia, as they sat down to
 table. “what do you think? it is excellent news, capital news, and about
 certain person that we all like.”
 
jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
 need not stay. lydia laughed, and said,--
 
“ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. you thought the
 waiter must not hear, as if cared! i dare say often hears worse
 things said than i am going to say. but is an ugly fellow! i am glad
 is gone. i never saw such long chin in my life. well, but now for
 my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?
 there is danger of wickham’s marrying mary king--there’s for you! she
 is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay. wickham is safe.”
 
“and mary king is safe!” added elizabeth; “safe from connection
 imprudent as to fortune.”
 
“she is great fool for going away, if she liked him.”
 
“but i hope there is strong attachment on either side,” said jane.
 
“i am sure there is not on _his_. i will answer for it, never cared
 three straws about her. who _could_ about such nasty little freckled
 thing?”
 
elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
 coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
 was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
 liberal!
 
as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
 ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
 boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty’s and
 lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.
 
“how nicely we are crammed in!” cried lydia. “i am glad i brought my
 bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! well, now
 let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
 home. and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
 since you went away. have you seen any pleasant men? have you had any
 flirting? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got husband
 before you came back. jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.
 she is almost three-and-twenty! lord! how ashamed i should be of not
 being married before three-and-twenty! my aunt philips wants you so to
 get husbands you can’t think. she says lizzy had better have taken mr.
 collins; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. lord!
 how i should like to be married before any of you! and then i would
 _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. dear me! we had such good piece
 of fun the other day at colonel forster’s! kitty and were to spend
 the day there, and mrs. forster promised to have little dance in the
 evening; (by-the-bye, mrs. forster and are _such_ friends!) and so
 she asked the two harringtons to come: but harriet was ill, and so pen
 was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? we
 dressed up chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a
 lady,--only think what fun! not soul knew of it, but colonel and mrs.
 forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
 one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well looked! when denny,
 and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
 did not know him in the least. lord! how i laughed! and so did mrs.
 forster. i thought i should have died. and _that_ made the men suspect
 something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”
 
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia,
 assisted by kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
 companions all the way to longbourn. elizabeth listened as little as she
 could, but there was escaping the frequent mention of wickham’s name.
 
their reception at home was most kind. mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane
 in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet
 say voluntarily to elizabeth,----
 
“i am glad you are come back, lizzy.”
 
their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases
 came to meet maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects
 which occupied them: lady lucas was inquiring of maria, across the
 table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs. bennet
 was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
 fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
 retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in voice
 rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various
 pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.
 
“oh, mary,” said she, “i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
 as we went along kitty and drew up all the blinds, and pretended
 there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if
 kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we
 behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
 cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
 treated you too. and then when we came away it was such fun! i thought
 we never should have got into the coach. i was ready to die of laughter.
 and then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so
 loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”
 
to this, mary very gravely replied, “far be it from me, my dear sister,
 to depreciate such pleasures. they would doubtless be congenial with the
 generality of female minds. but i confess they would have charms for
 _me_. i should infinitely prefer book.”
 
but of this answer lydia heard not word. she seldom listened to
 anybody for more than half minute, and never attended to mary at all.
 
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
 meryton, and see how everybody went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed
 the scheme. it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at
 home half day before they were in pursuit of the officers. there was
 another reason, too, for her opposition. she dreaded seeing wickham
 again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. the comfort to
 _her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond
 expression. in fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped
 there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.
 
she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton
 scheme, of which lydia had given them hint at the inn, was under
 frequent discussion between her parents. elizabeth saw directly that her
 father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
 at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
 disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.

elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no
 longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
 in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
 she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr.
 darcy and herself.
 
miss bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
 partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
 natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. she was
 sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in manner so
 little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
 unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.
 
“his being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly
 ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
 disappointment.”
 
“indeed,” replied elizabeth, “i am heartily sorry for him; but has
 other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
 you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”
 
“blame you! oh, no.”
 
“but you blame for having spoken so warmly of wickham?”
 
“no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
 
“but you _will_ know it, when i have told you what happened the very
 next day.”
 
she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
 as they concerned george wickham. what stroke was this for poor jane,
 who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
 so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here
 collected in one individual! nor was darcy’s vindication, though
 grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
 most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
 seek to clear one, without involving the other.
 
“this will not do,” said elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both
 of them good for anything. take your choice, but you must be satisfied
 with only one. there is but such quantity of merit between them; just
 enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
 about pretty much. for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr.
 darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”
 
it was some time, however, before smile could be extorted from jane.
 
“i do not know when i have been more shocked,” said she. “wickham so
 very bad! it is almost past belief. and poor mr. darcy! dear lizzy,
 only consider what must have suffered. such disappointment! and
 with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a
 thing of his sister! it is really too distressing, i am sure you must
 feel it so.”
 
“oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full
 of both. i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing
 every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. your profusion makes me
 saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as
 light as feather.”
 
“poor wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
 countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”
 
“there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
 two young men. one has got all the goodness, and the other all the
 appearance of it.”
 
“i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
 used to do.”
 
“and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided dislike
 to him, without any reason. it is such spur to one’s genius, such an
 opening for wit, to have dislike of that kind. one may be continually
 abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing
 at man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”
 
“lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat
 the matter as you do now.”
 
“indeed, i could not. i was uncomfortable enough, i was very
 uncomfortable--i may say unhappy. and with one to speak to of what i
 felt, jane to comfort me, and say that i had not been so very weak,
 and vain, and nonsensical, as i knew i had! oh, how i wanted you!”
 
“how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
 in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
 undeserved.”
 
“certainly. but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is most
 natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging. there is
 one point on which i want your advice. i want to be told whether i
 ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand
 wickham’s character.”
 
miss bennet paused little, and then replied, “surely there can be no
 occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. what is your own opinion?”
 
“that it ought not to be attempted. mr. darcy has not authorized to
 make his communication public. on the contrary, every particular
 relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
 myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
 conduct, who will believe me? the general prejudice against mr. darcy is
 so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
 meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. i am not equal to
 it. wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to
 anybody here what really is. some time hence it will be all found
 out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.
 at present i will say nothing about it.”
 
“you are quite right. to have his errors made public might ruin him for
 ever. is now, perhaps, sorry for what has done, and anxious to
 re-establish character. we must not make him desperate.”
 
the tumult of elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. she
 had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a
 fortnight, and was certain of willing listener in jane, whenever she
 might wish to talk again of either. but there was still something
 lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. she dared not
 relate the other half of mr. darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister
 how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. here was knowledge in
 which one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than
 perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in
 throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “and then,” said she, “if
 that very improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be
 able to tell what bingley may tell in much more agreeable manner
 himself. the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost
 all its value!”
 
she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
 state of her sister’s spirits. jane was not happy. she still cherished a
 very tender affection for bingley. having never even fancied herself in
 love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
 her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
 boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
 every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
 feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
 regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their
 tranquillity.
 
“well, lizzy,” said mrs. bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of
 this sad business of jane’s? for my part, i am determined never to speak
 of it again to anybody. i told my sister philips so the other day. but i
 cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london. well, is a
 very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least
 chance in the world of her ever getting him now. there is talk of his
 coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have inquired of
 everybody, too, who is likely to know.”
 
[illustration:
 
“i am determined never to speak of it again”
 ]
 
“i do not believe that will ever live at netherfield any more.”
 
“oh, well! it is just as chooses. nobody wants him to come; though i
 shall always say that used my daughter extremely ill; and, if i was
 her, i would not have put up with it. well, my comfort is, i am sure
 jane will die of broken heart, and then will be sorry for what he
 has done.”
 
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she
 made answer.
 
“well, lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the
 collinses live very comfortable, do they? well, well, i only hope it
 will last. and what sort of table do they keep? charlotte is an
 excellent manager, i dare say. if she is half as sharp as her mother,
 she is saving enough. there is nothing extravagant in _their_
 housekeeping, i dare say.”
 
“no, nothing at all.”
 
“a great deal of good management, depend upon it. yes, yes. _they_ will
 take care not to outrun their income. _they_ will never be distressed
 for money. well, much good may it do them! and so, i suppose, they often
 talk of having longbourn when your father is dead. they look upon it
 quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens.”
 
“it was subject which they could not mention before me.”
 
“no; it would have been strange if they had. but i make doubt they
 often talk of it between themselves. well, if they can be easy with an
 estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _i_ should be
 ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”

“when colonel miller’s regiment went away”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 



chapter xli.
 

[illustration]
 
the first week of their return was soon gone. the second began. it was
 the last of the regiment’s stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in
 the neighbourhood were drooping apace. the dejection was almost
 universal. the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
 and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. very
 frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
 lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
 hard-heartedness in any of the family.
 
“good heaven! what is to become of us? what are we to do?” would they
 often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “how can you be smiling so,
 lizzy?”
 
their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
 she had herself endured on similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.
 
“i am sure,” said she, “i cried for two days together when colonel
 miller’s regiment went away. i thought i should have broke my heart.”
 
“i am sure i shall break _mine_,” said lydia.
 
“if one could but go to brighton!” observed mrs. bennet.
 
“oh yes!--if one could but go to brighton! but papa is so disagreeable.”
 
“a little sea-bathing would set up for ever.”
 
“and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ great deal of good,”
 added kitty.
 
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
 longbourn house. elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
 of pleasure was lost in shame. she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy’s
 objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
 interference in the views of his friend.
 
but the gloom of lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
 received an invitation from mrs. forster, the wife of the colonel of the
 regiment, to accompany her to brighton. this invaluable friend was a
 very young woman, and very lately married. resemblance in good-humour
 and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of
 their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.
 
the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs. forster,
 the delight of mrs. bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely
 to be described. wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, lydia flew
 about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s
 congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
 whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
 in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
 
“i cannot see why mrs. forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia,”
 said she, “though i am _not_ her particular friend. i have just as much
 right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older.”
 
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make
 her resigned. as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
 exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she
 considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
 for the latter; and detestable as such step must make her, were it
 known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
 go. she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia’s general
 behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
 such woman as mrs. forster, and the probability of her being yet more
 imprudent with such companion at brighton, where the temptations must
 be greater than at home. heard her attentively, and then said,--
 
“lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
 place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
 expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
 circumstances.”
 
“if you were aware,” said elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to
 us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia’s unguarded and
 imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you
 would judge differently in the affair.”
 
“already arisen!” repeated mr. bennet. “what! has she frightened away
 some of your lovers? poor little lizzy! but do not be cast down. such
 squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with little absurdity
 are not worth regret. come, let see the list of the pitiful fellows
 who have been kept aloof by lydia’s folly.”
 
“indeed, you are mistaken. i have such injuries to resent. it is not
 of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining. our
 importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
 wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
 lydia’s character. excuse me,--for i must speak plainly. if you, my dear
 father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
 of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
 her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. her character
 will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
 that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the
 worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
 youth and tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of
 her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
 contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. in this danger kitty
 is also comprehended. she will follow wherever lydia leads. vain,
 ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! oh, my dear father, can you
 suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
 they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
 disgrace?”
 
mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,
 affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--
 
“do not make yourself uneasy, my love. wherever you and jane are known,
 you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
 advantage for having couple of--or i may say, three--very silly
 sisters. we shall have peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
 brighton. let her go, then. colonel forster is sensible man, and will
 keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
 object of prey to anybody. at brighton she will be of less importance
 even as common flirt than she has been here. the officers will find
 women better worth their notice. let us hope, therefore, that her being
 there may teach her her own insignificance. at any rate, she cannot grow
 many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
 of her life.”
 
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
 continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. it was not
 in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.
 she was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over
 unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was part of her
 disposition.
 
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
 father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
 united volubility. in lydia’s imagination, visit to brighton comprised
 every possibility of earthly happiness. she saw, with the creative eye
 of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
 she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at
 present unknown. she saw all the glories of the camp: its tents
 stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
 and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
 saw herself seated beneath tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
 officers at once.
 
[illustration:
 
“tenderly flirting”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
 such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? they could
 have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
 same. lydia’s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the
 melancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there
 himself.
 
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
 continued, with little intermission, to the very day of lydia’s leaving
 home.
 
elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time. having been
 frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
 well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. she had even
 learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
 an affectation and sameness to disgust and weary. in his present
 behaviour to herself, moreover, she had fresh source of displeasure;
 for the inclination soon testified of renewing those attentions which
 had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
 what had since passed, to provoke her. she lost all concern for him in
 finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
 gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
 reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
 cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
 and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.
 
on the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in meryton, dined,
 with others of the officers, at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth
 disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some
 inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she
 mentioned colonel fitzwilliam’s and mr. darcy’s having both spent three
 weeks at rosings, and asked him if were acquainted with the former.
 
looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with moment’s
 recollection, and returning smile, replied, that had formerly seen
 him often; and, after observing that was very gentlemanlike man,
 asked her how she had liked him. her answer was warmly in his favour.
 with an air of indifference, soon afterwards added, “how long did you
 say that was at rosings?”
 
“nearly three weeks.”
 
“and you saw him frequently?”
 
“yes, almost every day.”
 
“his manners are very different from his cousin’s.”
 
“yes, very different; but i think mr. darcy improves on acquaintance.”
 
“indeed!” cried wickham, with look which did not escape her. “and pray
 may i ask--” but checking himself, added, in gayer tone, “is it in
 address that improves? has deigned to add aught of civility to his
 ordinary style? for i dare not hope,” continued, in lower and more
 serious tone, “that is improved in essentials.”
 
“oh, no!” said elizabeth. “in essentials, i believe, is very much
 what ever was.”
 
while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
 rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. there was a
 something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
 and anxious attention, while she added,--
 
“when i said that improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that
 either his mind or manners were in state of improvement; but that,
 from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”
 
wickham’s alarm now appeared in heightened complexion and agitated
 look; for few minutes was silent; till, shaking off his
 embarrassment, turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
 accents,--
 
“you, who so well know my feelings towards mr. darcy, will readily
 comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that is wise enough to assume
 even the _appearance_ of what is right. his pride, in that direction,
 may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
 him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by. i only fear that
 the sort of cautiousness to which you, i imagine, have been alluding, is
 merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
 judgment stands much in awe. his fear of her has always operated, i
 know, when they were together; and good deal is to be imputed to his
 wish of forwarding the match with miss bourgh, which i am certain he
 has very much at heart.”
 
elizabeth could not repress smile at this, but she answered only by a
 slight inclination of the head. she saw that wanted to engage her on
 the old subject of his grievances, and she was in humour to indulge
 him. the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
 of usual cheerfulness, but with further attempt to distinguish
 elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
 mutual desire of never meeting again.
 
when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton,
 from whence they were to set out early the next morning. the separation
 between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. kitty was the
 only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. mrs.
 bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
 and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
 opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there
 was every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous
 happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
 of her sisters were uttered without being heard.

chapter xlii.
 

[illustration]
 
had elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
 not have formed very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
 comfort. her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
 of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
 woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
 their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. respect,
 esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of
 domestic happiness were overthrown. but mr. bennet was not of a
 disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
 imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often
 console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. was fond of
 the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
 enjoyments. to his wife was very little otherwise indebted than as
 her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. this is not
 the sort of happiness which man would in general wish to owe to his
 wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
 philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
 
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
 father’s behaviour as husband. she had always seen it with pain; but
 respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
 herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
 banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
 and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
 children, was so highly reprehensible. but she had never felt so
 strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
 unsuitable marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
 from so ill-judged direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,
 might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
 if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
 
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham’s departure, she found little
 other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. their parties
 abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had mother and
 sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around
 them threw real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty
 might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
 of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
 greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
 folly and assurance, by situation of such double danger as a
 watering-place and camp. upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
 has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked
 forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the
 satisfaction she had promised herself. it was consequently necessary to
 name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
 some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
 again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
 present, and prepare for another disappointment. her tour to the lakes
 was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation
 for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
 and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in the
 scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.
 
“but it is fortunate,” thought she, “that i have something to wish for.
 were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
 but here, by carrying with one ceaseless source of regret in my
 sister’s absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
 pleasure realized. scheme of which every part promises delight can
 never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
 the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”
 
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
 to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
 always very short. those to her mother contained little else than that
 they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
 had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
 made her quite wild; that she had new gown, or new parasol, which
 she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
 violent hurry, as mrs. forster called her, and they were going to the
 camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less
 to be learnt, for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much
 too full of lines under the words to be made public.
 
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,
 good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn. everything
 wore happier aspect. the families who had been in town for the winter
 came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. mrs.
 bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle
 of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton
 without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth
 hope, that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably
 reasonable as not to mention an officer above once day, unless, by
 some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office, another regiment
 should be quartered in meryton.
 
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
 approaching; and fortnight only was wanting of it, when letter
 arrived from mrs. gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
 curtailed its extent. mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from
 setting out till fortnight later in july, and must be in london again
 within month; and as that left too short period for them to go so
 far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
 the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
 the lakes, and substitute more contracted tour; and, according to the
 present plan, were to go farther northward than derbyshire. in that
 county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
 weeks; and to mrs. gardiner it had peculiarly strong attraction. the
 town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
 they were now to spend few days, was probably as great an object of
 her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock, chatsworth,
 dovedale, or the peak.
 
elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing
 the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. but it
 was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
 and all was soon right again.
 
with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. it was
 impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
 owner. “but surely,” said she, “i may enter his county with impunity,
 and rob it of few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”
 
the period of expectation was now doubled. four weeks were to pass away
 before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. but they did pass away, and mr. and
 mrs. gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
 longbourn. the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
 younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
 jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
 sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
 way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.
 
the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn, and set off the next
 morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. one
 enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
 suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
 inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
 and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
 disappointments abroad.
 
it is not the object of this work to give description of derbyshire,
 nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
 lay--oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenilworth, birmingham, etc., are
 sufficiently known. small part of derbyshire is all the present
 concern. to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs. gardiner’s
 former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
 acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
 all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
 lambton, elizabeth found, from her aunt, that pemberley was situated. it
 was not in their direct road; nor more than mile or two out of it. in
 talking over their route the evening before, mrs. gardiner expressed an
 inclination to see the place again. mr. gardiner declared his
 willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.
 
“my love, should not you like to see place of which you have heard so
 much?” said her aunt. “a place, too, with which so many of your
 acquaintance are connected. wickham passed all his youth there, you
 know.”
 
elizabeth was distressed. she felt that she had business at
 pemberley, and was obliged to assume disinclination for seeing it. she
 must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,
 she really had pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
 
mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity. “if it were merely fine house
 richly furnished,” said she, “i should not care about it myself; but the
 grounds are delightful. they have some of the finest woods in the
 country.”
 
elizabeth said more; but her mind could not acquiesce. the
 possibility of meeting mr. darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
 occurred. it would be dreadful! she blushed at the very idea; and
 thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such
 risk. but against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
 that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the
 absence of the family were unfavourably answered.
 
accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
 whether pemberley were not very fine place, what was the name of its
 proprietor, and, with little alarm, whether the family were down for
 the summer? most welcome negative followed the last question; and her
 alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel great deal of
 curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
 next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
 with proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
 to the scheme.
 
to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.

chapter xliii.
 

[illustration]
 
elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
 pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
 in at the lodge, her spirits were in high flutter.
 
the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. they
 entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
 beautiful wood stretching over wide extent.
 
elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
 every remarkable spot and point of view. they gradually ascended for
 half mile, and then found themselves at the top of considerable
 eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
 pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which
 the road with some abruptness wound. it was large, handsome stone
 building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by ridge of high
 woody hills; and in front stream of some natural importance was
 swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. its banks
 were neither formal nor falsely adorned. elizabeth was delighted. she
 had never seen place for which nature had done more, or where natural
 beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. they were
 all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
 to be mistress of pemberley might be something!
 
they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
 while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
 meeting its owner returned. she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
 mistaken. on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
 hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
 wonder at her being where she was.
 
the housekeeper came; respectable looking elderly woman, much less
 fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. they
 followed her into the dining-parlour. it was large, well-proportioned
 room, handsomely fitted up. elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
 to window to enjoy its prospect. the hill, crowned with wood, from
 which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
 distance, was beautiful object. every disposition of the ground was
 good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
 on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
 it, with delight. as they passed into other rooms, these objects were
 taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties
 to be seen. the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture
 suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with
 admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly
 fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the
 furniture of rosings.
 
“and of this place,” thought she, “i might have been mistress! with
 these rooms i might have now been familiarly acquainted! instead of
 viewing them as stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
 welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. but, no,” recollecting
 herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
 me; i should not have been allowed to invite them.”
 
this was lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.
 
she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really
 absent, but had not courage for it. at length, however, the question was
 asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs. reynolds
 replied, that was; adding, “but we expect him to-morrow, with large
 party of friends.” how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had
 not by any circumstance been delayed day!
 
her aunt now called her to look at picture. she approached, and saw
 the likeness of mr. wickham, suspended, amongst several other
 miniatures, over the mantel-piece. her aunt asked her, smilingly, how
 she liked it. the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the
 picture of young gentleman, the of her late master’s steward, who
 had been brought up by him at his own expense. “he is now gone into the
 army,” she added; “but i am afraid has turned out very wild.”
 
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with smile, but elizabeth could not
 return it.
 
“and that,” said mrs. reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
 “is my master--and very like him. it was drawn at the same time as the
 other--about eight years ago.”
 
“i have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said mrs. gardiner,
 looking at the picture; “it is handsome face. but, lizzy, you can tell
 us whether it is like or not.”
 
mrs. reynolds’ respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
 intimation of her knowing her master.
 
“does that young lady know mr. darcy?”
 
elizabeth coloured, and said, “a little.”
 
“and do not you think him very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”
 
“yes, very handsome.”
 
“i am sure _i_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you
 will see finer, larger picture of him than this. this room was my late
 master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
 be then. was very fond of them.”
 
this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickham’s being among them.
 
mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn
 when she was only eight years old.
 
“and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?” said mr. gardiner.
 
“oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
 accomplished! she plays and sings all day long. in the next room is a
 new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she
 comes here to-morrow with him.”
 
mr. gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
 communicativeness by his questions and remarks: mrs. reynolds, either
 from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
 master and his sister.
 
“is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?”
 
“not so much as i could wish, sir: but i dare say may spend half his
 time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months.”
 
“except,” thought elizabeth, “when she goes to ramsgate.”
 
“if your master would marry, you might see more of him.”
 
“yes, sir; but i do not know when _that_ will be. i do not know who is
 good enough for him.”
 
mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled. elizabeth could not help saying, “it is
 very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so.”
 
“i say more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows
 him,” replied the other. elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
 and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
 “i have never had cross word from him in my life, and i have known him
 ever since was four years old.”
 
this was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
 ideas. that was not good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
 her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was
 grateful to her uncle for saying,--
 
“there are very few people of whom so much can be said. you are lucky in
 having such master.”
 
“yes, sir, i know i am. if i were to go through the world, i could not
 meet with better. but i have always observed, that they who are
 good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
 was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
 world.”
 
elizabeth almost stared at her. “can this be mr. darcy?” thought she.
 
“his father was an excellent man,” said mrs. gardiner.
 
“yes, ma’am, that was indeed; and his will be just like him--just
 as affable to the poor.”
 
elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. mrs.
 reynolds could interest her on other point. she related the subjects
 of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
 furniture in vain. mr. gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
 prejudice, to which attributed her excessive commendation of her
 master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
 many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.
 
“he is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever
 lived. not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
 themselves. there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
 give him good name. some people call him proud; but i am sure i never
 saw anything of it. to my fancy, it is only because does not rattle
 away like other young men.”
 
“in what an amiable light does this place him!” thought elizabeth.
 
“this fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not
 quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”
 
“perhaps we might be deceived.”
 
“that is not very likely; our authority was too good.”
 
on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into very pretty
 sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
 the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
 give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken liking to the room, when
 last at pemberley.
 
“he is certainly good brother,” said elizabeth, as she walked towards
 one of the windows.
 
mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy’s delight, when she should enter
 the room. “and this is always the way with him,” she added. “whatever
 can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in moment. there
 is nothing would not do for her.”
 
the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
 all that remained to be shown. in the former were many good paintings:
 but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
 visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
 darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
 also more intelligible.
 
in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
 little to fix the attention of stranger. elizabeth walked on in quest
 of the only face whose features would be known to her. at last it
 arrested her--and she beheld striking resemblance of mr. darcy, with
 such smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
 when looked at her. she stood several minutes before the picture, in
 earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
 gallery. mrs. reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
 father’s lifetime.
 
there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth’s mind, more gentle
 sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of
 their acquaintance. the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds
 was of trifling nature. what praise is more valuable than the praise
 of an intelligent servant? as brother, landlord, master, she
 considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! how
 much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! how much of good
 or evil must be done by him! every idea that had been brought forward by
 the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before
 the canvas, on which was represented, and fixed his eyes upon
 herself, she thought of his regard with deeper sentiment of gratitude
 than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened
 its impropriety of expression.
 
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
 they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
 consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.
 
as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back
 to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was
 conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
 suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.
 
they were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his
 appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. their eyes
 instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
 blush. absolutely started, and for moment seemed immovable from
 surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
 and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
 of perfect civility.
 
she had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
 received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
 overcome. had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
 they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
 that they now saw mr. darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on
 beholding his master, must immediately have told it. they stood little
 aloof while was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
 scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
 returned to his civil inquiries after her family. amazed at the
 alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
 uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
 impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
 minutes in which they continued together were some of the most
 uncomfortable of her life. nor did seem much more at ease; when he
 spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and repeated his
 inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay
 in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried way, as plainly spoke the
 distraction of his thoughts.
 
at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing few
 moments without saying word, suddenly recollected himself, and took
 leave.
 
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
 figure; but elizabeth heard not word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
 feelings, followed them in silence. she was overpowered by shame and
 vexation. her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
 thing in the world! how strange must it appear to him! in what a
 disgraceful light might it not strike so vain man! it might seem as if
 she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! oh! why did she come?
 or, why did thus come day before was expected? had they been
 only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
 discrimination; for it was plain that was that moment arrived, that
 moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. she blushed again and
 again over the perverseness of the meeting. and his behaviour, so
 strikingly altered,--what could it mean? that should even speak to
 her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her
 family! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
 never had spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.
 what contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park, when
 put his letter into her hand! she knew not what to think, or how to
 account for it.
 
they had now entered beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
 every step was bringing forward nobler fall of ground, or finer
 reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time
 before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
 mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
 to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
 distinguished part of the scene. her thoughts were all fixed on that
 one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr. darcy then
 was. she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
 what manner thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
 she was still dear to him. perhaps had been civil only because he
 felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
 not like ease. whether had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
 her, she could not tell, but certainly had not seen her with
 composure.
 
at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
 roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.
 
they entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for while,
 ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
 of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
 the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
 overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. mr. gardiner
 expressed wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be
 beyond walk. with triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
 miles round. it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
 circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in descent among
 hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.
 they crossed it by simple bridge, in character with the general air of
 the scene: it was spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
 the valley, here contracted into glen, allowed room only for the
 stream, and narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
 it. elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
 the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs. gardiner,
 who was not great walker, could go farther, and thought only of
 returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. her niece was,
 therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
 on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
 progress was slow, for mr. gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
 taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
 occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
 about them, that advanced but little. whilst wandering on in this
 slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth’s astonishment was
 quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr. darcy
 approaching them, and at great distance. the walk being here less
 sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
 met. elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
 interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
 calmness, if really intended to meet them. for few moments, indeed,
 she felt that would probably strike into some other path. the idea
 lasted while turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
 turning past, was immediately before them. with glance she saw that
 had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,
 she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not
 got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky
 recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of pemberley from
 her might be mischievously construed. her colour changed, and she said
 more.
 
mrs. gardiner was standing little behind; and on her pausing, asked
 her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
 this was stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
 she could hardly suppress smile at his being now seeking the
 acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
 revolted, in his offer to herself. “what will be his surprise,” thought
 she, “when knows who they are! takes them now for people of
 fashion.”
 
the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
 relationship to herself, she stole sly look at him, to see how bore
 it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
 could from such disgraceful companions. that was _surprised_ by the
 connection was evident: sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,
 so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
 conversation with mr. gardiner. elizabeth could not but be pleased,
 could not but triumph. it was consoling that should know she had some
 relations for whom there was need to blush. she listened most
 attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
 expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
 his taste, or his good manners.
 
the conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard mr. darcy
 invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
 chose, while continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
 time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
 the stream where there was usually most sport. mrs. gardiner, who was
 walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her look expressive of her
 wonder. elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
 compliment must be all for herself. her astonishment, however, was
 extreme; and continually was she repeating, “why is so altered? from
 what can it proceed? it cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
 that his manners are thus softened. my reproofs at hunsford could not
 work such change as this. it is impossible that should still love
 me.”
 
after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
 gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
 brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
 water-plant, there chanced to be little alteration. it originated in
 mrs. gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
 elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
 her husband’s. mr. darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
 together. after short silence the lady first spoke. she wished him to
 know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
 place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
 very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that
 you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we
 left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
 the country.” acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
 business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward few hours
 before the rest of the party with whom had been travelling. “they
 will join early to-morrow,” continued, “and among them are some
 who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr. bingley and his sisters.”
 
elizabeth answered only by slight bow. her thoughts were instantly
 driven back to the time when mr. bingley’s name had been last mentioned
 between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
 not very differently engaged.
 
“there is also one other person in the party,” continued after a
 pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. will you allow
 me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
 during your stay at lambton?”
 
the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
 for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. she immediately felt
 that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
 must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
 satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
 him think really ill of her.
 
they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. elizabeth
 was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
 pleased. his wish of introducing his sister to her was compliment of
 the highest kind. they soon outstripped the others; and when they had
 reached the carriage, mr. and mrs. gardiner were half quarter of a
 mile behind.
 
then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
 tired, and they stood together on the lawn. at such time much might
 have been said, and silence was very awkward. she wanted to talk, but
 there seemed an embargo on every subject. at last she recollected that
 she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dovedale with
 great perseverance. yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
 and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.
 
on mr. and mrs. gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into
 the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they
 parted on each side with the utmost politeness. mr. darcy handed the
 ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him
 walking slowly towards the house.
 
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
 pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
 
“he is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.
 
“there _is_ something little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her
 aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. i can now
 say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
 _i_ have seen nothing of it.”
 
“i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. it was more
 than civil; it was really attentive; and there was necessity for such
 attention. his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling.”
 
“to be sure, lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as wickham;
 or rather has not wickham’s countenance, for his features are
 perfectly good. but how came you to tell us that was so
 disagreeable?”
 
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked
 him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never
 seen him so pleasant as this morning.
 
“but perhaps may be little whimsical in his civilities,” replied
 her uncle. “your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him
 at his word about fishing, as might change his mind another day, and
 warn off his grounds.”
 
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
 nothing.
 
“from what we have seen of him,” continued mrs. gardiner, “i really
 should not have thought that could have behaved in so cruel way by
 anybody as has done by poor wickham. has not an ill-natured look.
 on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
 speaks. and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would
 not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. but, to be sure, the
 good lady who showed us the house did give him most flaming character!
 i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. but is liberal
 master, i suppose, and _that_, in the eye of servant, comprehends
 every virtue.”
 
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
 his behaviour to wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as
 guarded manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
 relations in kent, his actions were capable of very different
 construction; and that his character was by means so faulty, nor
 wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire. in
 confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
 transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
 her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.
 
mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now
 approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
 the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
 to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
 anything else. fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had
 sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
 acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
 intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.
 
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
 much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
 but think, and think with wonder, of mr. darcy’s civility, and, above
 all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.

elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit
 her the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was, consequently,
 resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
 but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
 arrival at lambton these visitors came. they had been walking about the
 place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
 to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
 carriage drew them to window, and they saw gentleman and lady in a
 curricle driving up the street. elizabeth, immediately recognizing the
 livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted small degree of surprise
 to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
 expected. her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
 of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
 of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them new idea on
 the business. nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
 that there was other way of accounting for such attentions from such
 quarter than by supposing partiality for their niece. while these
 newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
 elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. she was quite amazed
 at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she
 dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
 her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
 suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.
 
she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
 up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
 inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.
 
miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
 took place. with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new
 acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. since her
 being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud;
 but the observation of very few minutes convinced her that she was
 only exceedingly shy. she found it difficult to obtain even word from
 her beyond monosyllable.
 
miss darcy was tall, and on larger scale than elizabeth; and, though
 little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
 womanly and graceful. she was less handsome than her brother, but there
 was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
 unassuming and gentle. elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
 acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been, was much
 relieved by discerning such different feelings.
 
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was
 also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
 satisfaction, and prepare for such visitor, when bingley’s quick step
 was heard on the stairs, and in moment entered the room. all
 elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
 felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
 cordiality with which expressed himself on seeing her again. he
 inquired in friendly, though general, way, after her family, and
 looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that had ever done.
 
to mr. and mrs. gardiner was scarcely less interesting personage
 than to herself. they had long wished to see him. the whole party before
 them, indeed, excited lively attention. the suspicions which had just
 arisen of mr. darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
 each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from
 those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
 it was to love. of the lady’s sensations they remained little in
 doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
 evident enough.
 
elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. she wanted to ascertain the
 feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
 make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
 feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom
 she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.
 bingley was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be
 pleased.

in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
 how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a
 like manner. sometimes she could fancy that talked less than on
 former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
 that, as looked at her, was trying to trace resemblance. but,
 though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
 behaviour to miss darcy, who had been set up as rival to jane. no
 look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. nothing
 occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. on
 this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances
 occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted
 recollection of jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and wish of
 saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had dared. he
 observed to her, at moment when the others were talking together, and
 in tone which had something of real regret, that it “was very long
 time since had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could
 reply, added, “it is above eight months. we have not met since the
 26th of november, when we were all dancing together at netherfield.”
 
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and afterwards
 took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
 _all_ her sisters were at longbourn. there was not much in the question,
 nor in the preceding remark; but there was look and manner which
 gave them meaning.
 
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself; but
 whenever she did catch glimpse she saw an expression of general
 complaisance, and in all that said, she heard an accent so far
 removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her
 that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,
 however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one
 day. when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the
 good opinion of people with whom any intercourse few months ago would
 have been disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,
 but to the very relations whom had openly disdained, and recollected
 their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the
 change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could
 hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. never, even in the
 company of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations
 at rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
 self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when importance could
 result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
 acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
 down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
 rosings.
 
their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose
 to depart, mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
 their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner
 at pemberley, before they left the country. miss darcy, though with a
 diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
 readily obeyed. mrs. gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
 how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
 acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head. presuming, however,
 that this studied avoidance spoke rather momentary embarrassment than
 any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
 society, perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
 her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
 
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
 again, having still great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
 make after all their hertfordshire friends. elizabeth, construing all
 this into wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and
 on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
 visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
 satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been
 little. eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
 uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
 favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
 
but she had reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner’s curiosity; it was
 not their wish to force her communication. it was evident that she was
 much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of;
 it was evident that was very much in love with her. they saw much to
 interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
 
of mr. darcy it was now matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
 as their acquaintance reached, there was fault to find. they could
 not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
 from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference
 to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which was known
 would not have recognized it for mr. darcy. there was now an interest,
 however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
 that the authority of servant, who had known him since was four
 years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
 hastily rejected. neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
 their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. they had
 nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride probably had, and if not,
 it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of small market town
 where the family did not visit. it was acknowledged, however, that he
 was liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
 
with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that was not held
 there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
 of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet well-known
 fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, had left many debts behind
 him, which mr. darcy afterwards discharged.
 
as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than
 the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
 long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
 she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. she
 certainly did not hate him. no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
 had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling dislike against him,
 that could be so called. the respect created by the conviction of his
 valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
 time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
 into somewhat of friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his
 favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable light,
 which yesterday had produced. but above all, above respect and esteem,
 there was motive within her of good-will which could not be
 overlooked. it was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once
 loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the
 petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
 unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. who, she had been
 persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
 accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and
 without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,
 where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good
 opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. such
 change in man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but
 gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as
 such, its impression on her was of sort to be encouraged, as by no
 means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. she respected,
 she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt real interest in his
 welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
 depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
 that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
 possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.
 
it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
 such striking civility as miss darcy’s, in coming to them on the very
 day of her arrival at pemberley--for she had reached it only to late
 breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
 some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
 would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
 morning. they were, therefore, to go. elizabeth was pleased; though when
 she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
 
mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast. the fishing scheme had been
 renewed the day before, and positive engagement made of his meeting
 some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.

convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley’s dislike of her had
 originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
 her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know
 with how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now
 be renewed.
 
on reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
 whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. its windows,
 opening to the ground, admitted most refreshing view of the high woody
 hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts
 which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.
 
in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there
 with mrs. hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
 london. georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with
 all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
 fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
 inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. mrs. gardiner and
 her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.
 
by mrs. hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by courtesy; and
 on their being seated, pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
 succeeded for few moments. it was first broken by mrs. annesley, a
 genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
 of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
 others; and between her and mrs. gardiner, with occasional help from
 elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. miss darcy looked as if she
 wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
 short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.
 
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley,
 and that she could not speak word, especially to miss darcy, without
 calling her attention. this observation would not have prevented her
 from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
 inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
 of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. she expected every
 moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she
 feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
 she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. after
 sitting in this manner quarter of an hour, without hearing miss
 bingley’s voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her cold
 inquiry after the health of her family. she answered with equal
 indifference and brevity, and the other said more.
 
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
 entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and variety of all the
 finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
 significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been
 given, to remind her of her post. there was now employment for the whole
 party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
 beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
 them round the table.
 
while thus engaged, elizabeth had fair opportunity of deciding whether
 she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy, by the
 feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
 moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
 regret that came.
 
had been some time with mr. gardiner, who, with two or three other
 gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him
 only on learning that the ladies of the family intended visit to
 georgiana that morning. sooner did appear, than elizabeth wisely
 resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
 necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
 saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
 and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
 when first came into the room. in countenance was attentive
 curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley’s, in spite of the
 smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
 objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
 to mr. darcy were by means over. miss darcy, on her brother’s
 entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he
 was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
 as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. miss
 bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
 first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--
 
“pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?
 they must be great loss to _your_ family.”
 
in darcy’s presence she dared not mention wickham’s name: but elizabeth
 instantly comprehended that was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
 various recollections connected with him gave her moment’s distress;
 but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
 presently answered the question in tolerably disengaged tone. while
 she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her darcy with heightened
 complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
 confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. had miss bingley known what
 pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
 refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
 elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of man to whom she believed
 her partial, to make her betray sensibility which might injure her in
 darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
 and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with
 that corps. not syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy’s
 meditated elopement. to creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
 was possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley’s connections
 her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
 which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
 hereafter her own. had certainly formed such plan; and without
 meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
 bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
 for the welfare of his friend.
 
elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
 as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
 wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
 to speak any more. her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
 recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which
 had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have
 fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.
 
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
 mentioned; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage,
 miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth’s
 person, behaviour, and dress. but georgiana would not join her. her
 brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment
 could not err; and had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave
 georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and
 amiable. when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley could not help
 repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.
 
“how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr. darcy,” she cried: “i
 never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.
 she is grown so brown and coarse! louisa and i were agreeing that we
 should not have known her again.”
 
however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address, contented
 himself with coolly replying, that perceived other alteration than
 her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
 summer.
 
“for my own part,” she rejoined, “i must confess that i never could see
 any beauty in her. her face is too thin; her complexion has no
 brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. her nose wants
 character; there is nothing marked in its lines. her teeth are
 tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
 have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive anything
 extraordinary in them. they have sharp, shrewish look, which i do not
 like at all; and in her air altogether, there is self-sufficiency
 without fashion, which is intolerable.”
 
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not
 the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
 wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
 success she expected. was resolutely silent, however; and, from a
 determination of making him speak, she continued,--
 
“i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all
 were to find that she was reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect
 your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, ‘_she_
 beauty! i should as soon call her mother wit.’ but afterwards she
 seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
 one time.”
 
“yes,” replied darcy, who could contain himself longer, “but _that_
 was only when i first knew her; for it is many months since i have
 considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”
 
then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
 having forced him to say what gave one any pain but herself.
 
mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
 visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
 both. the looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
 except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. they talked
 of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but
 himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of
 him, and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s
 beginning the subject.

chapter xlvi.

elizabeth had been good deal disappointed in not finding letter from
 jane on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had been
 renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on
 the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
 receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
 it had been mis-sent elsewhere. elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
 jane had written the direction remarkably ill.
 
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
 uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
 themselves. the one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been
 written five days ago. the beginning contained an account of all their
 little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
 but the latter half, which was dated day later, and written in evident
 agitation, gave more important intelligence. it was to this effect:--
 
“since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of a
 most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming you--be
 assured that we are all well. what i have to say relates to poor lydia.
 an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
 from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland
 with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham! imagine our
 surprise. to kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. i am
 very, very sorry. so imprudent match on both sides! but i am willing
 to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
 thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him, but this step (and
 let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. his choice is
 disinterested at least, for must know my father can give her nothing.
 our poor mother is sadly grieved. my father bears it better. how
 thankful am i, that we never let them know what has been said against
 him; we must forget it ourselves. they were off saturday night about
 twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
 eight. the express was sent off directly. my dear lizzy, they must have
 passed within ten miles of us. colonel forster gives us reason to expect
 him here soon. lydia left few lines for his wife, informing her of
 their intention. i must conclude, for i cannot be long from my poor
 mother. i am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but i hardly
 know what i have written.”
 
without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
 what she felt, elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
 other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
 had been written day later than the conclusion of the first.
 
“by this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; i
 wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
 head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent. dearest
 lizzy, i hardly know what i would write, but i have bad news for you,
 and it cannot be delayed. imprudent as marriage between mr. wickham
 and our poor lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
 taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
 to scotland. colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the
 day before, not many hours after the express. though lydia’s short
 letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to gretna
 green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w.
 never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which was repeated
 to colonel f., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from b.,
 intending to trace their route. did trace them easily to clapham, but
 farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a
 hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom.
 all that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the
 london road. i know not what to think. after making every possible
 inquiry on that side of london, colonel f. came on into hertfordshire,
 anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in barnet
 and hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to
 pass through. with the kindest concern came on to longbourn, and
 broke his apprehensions to us in manner most creditable to his heart.
 i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f.; but one can throw any
 blame on them. our distress, my dear lizzy, is very great. my father and
 mother believe the worst, but i cannot think so ill of him. many
 circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married
 privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_
 could form such design against young woman of lydia’s connections,
 which is not likely, can i suppose her so lost to everything?
 impossible! i grieve to find, however, that colonel f. is not disposed
 to depend upon their marriage: shook his head when i expressed my
 hopes, and said feared w. was not man to be trusted. my poor mother
 is really ill, and keeps her room. could she exert herself, it would be
 better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in
 my life saw him so affected. poor kitty has anger for having concealed
 their attachment; but as it was matter of confidence, one cannot
 wonder. i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared
 something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is
 over, shall i own that i long for your return? i am not so selfish,
 however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. adieu! i take up my pen
 again to do, what i have just told you i would not; but circumstances
 are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as
 soon as possible. i know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that i am not
 afraid of requesting it, though i have still something more to ask of
 the former. my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly,
 to try to discover her. what means to do, i am sure i know not; but
 his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the
 best and safest way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton
 again to-morrow evening. in such an exigence my uncle’s advice and
 assistance would be everything in the world; will immediately
 comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness.”
 
“oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried elizabeth, darting from her seat
 as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
 moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
 opened by servant, and mr. darcy appeared. her pale face and
 impetuous manner made him start, and before could recover himself
 enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia’s
 situation, hastily exclaimed, “i beg your pardon, but i must leave you.
 i must find mr. gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;
 i have not an instant to lose.”
 
“good god! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than
 politeness; then recollecting himself, “i will not detain you minute;
 but let me, or let the servant, go after mr. and mrs. gardiner. you are
 not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”
 
elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
 little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. calling back
 the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
 accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
 mistress home instantly.
 
on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
 looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her,
 or to refrain from saying, in tone of gentleness and commiseration,
 “let call your maid. is there nothing you could take to give you
 present relief? glass of wine; shall i get you one? you are very ill.”
 
“no, i thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “there
 is nothing the matter with me. i am quite well, i am only distressed by
 some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn.”
 
she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for few minutes could
 not speak another word. darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
 something indistinctly of his
 
[illustration:
 
“i have not an instant to lose”
 ]
 
concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. at length she spoke
 again. “i have just had letter from jane, with such dreadful news. it
 cannot be concealed from anyone. my youngest sister has left all her
 friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of mr.
 wickham. they are gone off together from brighton. _you_ know him too
 well to doubt the rest. she has money, connections, nothing that
 can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”
 
darcy was fixed in astonishment.
 
“when i consider,” she added, in yet more agitated voice, “that _i_
 might have prevented it! _i_ who knew what was. had i but explained
 some part of it only--some part of what i learnt, to my own family! had
 his character been known, this could not have happened. but it is all,
 all too late now.”
 
“i am grieved, indeed,” cried darcy: “grieved--shocked. but is it
 certain, absolutely certain?”
 
“oh, yes! they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced
 almost to london, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to
 scotland.”
 
“and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”
 
“my father has gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle’s
 immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour. but
 nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done. how is
 such man to be worked on? how are they even to be discovered? i have
 not the smallest hope. it is every way horrible!”
 
darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
 
“when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had i known what
 i ought, what i dared to do! but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too
 much. wretched, wretched mistake!”
 
darcy made answer. seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
 and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
 gloomy. elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. her power
 was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such proof of family
 weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. she could neither
 wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
 consolatory to her bosom, afforded palliation of her distress. it
 was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
 wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
 him, as now, when all love must be vain.
 
but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. lydia--the
 humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up
 every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
 elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after pause of
 several minutes, was only recalled to sense of her situation by the
 voice of her companion, who, in manner which, though it spoke
 compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--
 
“i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i anything
 to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.
 would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,
 that might offer consolation to such distress! but i will not torment
 you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
 this unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister’s having the
 pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day.”
 
“oh, yes! be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy. say that
 urgent business calls us home immediately. conceal the unhappy truth as
 long as it is possible. i know it cannot be long.”
 
readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for
 her distress, wished it happier conclusion than there was at present
 reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with
 only one serious parting look, went away.
 
as quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
 should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
 marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a
 retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
 contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
 feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
 formerly have rejoiced in its termination.
 
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth’s
 change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. but if
 otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
 unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
 first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
 exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
 somewhat of trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham,
 and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other
 less interesting mode of attachment. be that as it may, she saw him go
 with regret; and in this early example of what lydia’s infamy must
 produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
 business. never since reading jane’s second letter had she entertained a
 hope of wickham’s meaning to marry her. one but jane, she thought,
 could flatter herself with such an expectation. surprise was the least
 of all her feelings on this development. while the contents of the first
 letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,
 that wickham should marry girl whom it was impossible could marry
 for money; and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
 incomprehensible. but now it was all too natural. for such an attachment
 as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
 suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
 intention of marriage, she had difficulty in believing that neither
 her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
 prey.
 
she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that
 lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that lydia had
 wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. sometimes one
 officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
 raised them in her opinion. her affections had been continually
 fluctuating, but never without an object. the mischief of neglect and
 mistaken indulgence towards such girl--oh! how acutely did she now
 feel it!
 
she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
 share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
 family so deranged; father absent, mother incapable of exertion, and
 requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
 could be done for lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost
 importance, and till entered the room the misery of her impatience
 was severe. mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
 by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but
 satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
 cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
 the postscript of the last with trembling energy. though lydia had never
 been favourite with them, mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be
 deeply affected. not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
 the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr. gardiner readily
 promised every assistance in his power. elizabeth, though expecting no
 less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
 by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily
 settled. they were to be off as soon as possible. “but what is to be
 done about pemberley?” cried mrs. gardiner. “john told us mr. darcy was
 here when you sent for us;--was it so?”
 
“yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
 _that_ is all settled.”
 
“what is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
 prepare. “and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
 truth? oh, that i knew how it was!”
 
but wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the
 hurry and confusion of the following hour. had elizabeth been at leisure
 to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
 impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
 business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
 be written to all their friends at lambton, with false excuses for their
 sudden departure. an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr.
 gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing
 remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of
 the morning, found herself, in shorter space of time than she could
 have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn.

chapter xlvii.

“i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they
 drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, i am much
 more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
 matter. it appears to so very unlikely that any young man should form
 such design against girl who is by means unprotected or
 friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel’s family, that i
 am strongly inclined to hope the best. could expect that her friends
 would not step forward? could expect to be noticed again by the
 regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster? his temptation is
 not adequate to the risk.”
 
“do you really think so?” cried elizabeth, brightening up for moment.
 
“upon my word,” said mrs. gardiner, “i begin to be of your uncle’s
 opinion. it is really too great violation of decency, honour, and
 interest, for him to be guilty of it. i cannot think so very ill of
 wickham. can you, yourself, lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe
 him capable of it?”
 
“not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. but of every other neglect
 i can believe him capable. if, indeed, it should be so! but i dare not
 hope it. why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the
 case?”
 
“in the first place,” replied mr. gardiner, “there is absolute proof
 that they are not gone to scotland.”
 
“oh, but their removing from the chaise into hackney coach is such a
 presumption! and, besides, traces of them were to be found on the
 barnet road.”
 
“well, then,--supposing them to be in london--they may be there, though
 for the purpose of concealment, for more exceptionable purpose. it is
 not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
 might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
 expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland.”
 
“but why all this secrecy? why any fear of detection? why must their
 marriage be private? oh, no, no--this is not likely. his most particular
 friend, you see by jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending
 to marry her. wickham will never marry woman without some money. he
 cannot afford it. and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she
 beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake
 forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? as to what
 restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
 dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know
 nothing of the effects that such step might produce. but as to your
 other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good. lydia has no
 brothers to step forward; and might imagine, from my father’s
 behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention has ever
 seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
 do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
 such matter.”
 
“but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,
 as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”
 
“it does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied elizabeth, with
 tears in her eyes, “that sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such
 point should admit of doubt. but, really, i know not what to say.
 perhaps i am not doing her justice. but she is very young: she has never
 been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
 nay, for twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
 and vanity. she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
 and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
 since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love,
 flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. she has been doing
 everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
 greater--what shall i call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which
 are naturally lively enough. and we all know that wickham has every
 charm of person and address that can captivate woman.”
 
“but you see that jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of
 wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”
 
“of whom does jane ever think ill? and who is there, whatever might be
 their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
 till it were proved against them? but jane knows, as well as i do, what
 wickham really is. we both know that has been profligate in every
 sense of the word; that has neither integrity nor honour; that is
 as false and deceitful as is insinuating.”
 
“and do you really know all this?” cried mrs. gardiner, whose curiosity
 as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
 
“i do, indeed,” replied elizabeth, colouring. “i told you the other day
 of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
 longbourn, heard in what manner spoke of the man who had behaved with
 such forbearance and liberality towards him. and there are other
 circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
 relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless. from
 what said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see proud,
 reserved, disagreeable girl. yet knew to the contrary himself. he
 must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
 her.”
 
“but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
 and jane seem so well to understand?”
 
“oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. till i was in kent, and saw
 so much both of mr. darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam, i was
 ignorant of the truth myself. and when i returned home the ----shire
 was to leave meryton in week or fortnight’s time. as that was the
 case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it
 necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
 apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the
 neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? and even when it
 was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster, the necessity of
 opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. that _she_ could
 be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. that such a
 consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
 enough from my thoughts.”
 
“when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had reason, i
 suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”
 
“not the slightest. i can remember symptom of affection on either
 side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
 that ours is not family on which it could be thrown away. when first
 entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
 were. every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for
 the first two months: but never distinguished _her_ by any particular
 attention; and, consequently, after moderate period of extravagant and
 wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
 who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”
 
it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
 to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by
 its repeated discussion, other could detain them from it long, during
 the whole of the journey. from elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.
 fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could
 find interval of ease or forgetfulness.
 
they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
 the road, reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day. it was comfort
 to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long
 expectations.
 
the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of chaise, were standing
 on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
 carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
 faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in variety of
 capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.
 
elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them hasty kiss,
 hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running downstairs from
 her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.
 
elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
 eyes of both, lost not moment in asking whether anything had been
 heard of the fugitives.
 
“not yet,” replied jane. “but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope
 everything will be well.”
 
“is my father in town?”
 
“yes, went on tuesday, as i wrote you word.”
 
“and have you heard from him often?”
 
“we have heard only once. wrote few lines on wednesday, to say
 that had arrived in safety, and to give his directions, which i
 particularly begged him to do. merely added, that should not write
 again, till had something of importance to mention.”
 
“and my mother--how is she? how are you all?”
 
“my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly
 shaken. she is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
 all. she does not yet leave her dressing-room. mary and kitty, thank
 heaven! are quite well.”
 
“but you--how are you?” cried elizabeth. “you look pale. how much you
 must have gone through!”
 
her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
 conversation, which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were
 engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of
 the whole party. jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
 thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.
 
when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth
 had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
 found that jane had intelligence to give. the sanguine hope of good,
 however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
 deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
 every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father,
 to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.
 
mrs. bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after few minutes’
 conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
 tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
 conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
 blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
 errors of her daughter must be principally owing.
 
“if i had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to brighton
 with all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear lydia
 had nobody to take care of her. why did the forsters ever let her go out
 of their sight? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
 side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such thing, if she had
 been well looked after. i always thought they were very unfit to have
 the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am. poor, dear
 child! and now here’s mr. bennet gone away, and i know will fight
 wickham, wherever meets him, and then will be killed, and what is
 to become of us all? the collinses will turn us out, before is cold
 in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what
 we shall do.”
 
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr. gardiner, after
 general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
 that meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist mr.
 bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.
 
“do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be
 prepared for the worst, there is occasion to look on it as certain.
 it is not quite week since they left brighton. in few days more, we
 may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
 and have design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
 lost. as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him
 come home with to gracechurch street, and then we may consult
 together as to what is to be done.”
 
“oh, my dear brother,” replied mrs. bennet, “that is exactly what i
 could most wish for. and now do, when you get to town, find them out,
 wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
 marry. and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
 tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
 after they are married. and, above all things, keep mr. bennet from
 fighting. tell him what dreadful state i am in--that i am frightened
 out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,
 such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my
 heart, that i can get rest by night nor by day. and tell my dear
 lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,
 for she does not know which are the best warehouses. oh, brother, how
 kind you are! i know you will contrive it all.”
 
but mr. gardiner, though assured her again of his earnest endeavours
 in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
 her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till
 dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
 housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.
 
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was real
 occasion for such seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
 oppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
 tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
 better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
 most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
 subject.
 
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been
 too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
 before. one came from her books, and the other from her toilette. the
 faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and change was visible
 in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
 which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more
 of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty. as for mary, she was
 mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth, with countenance
 of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--
 
“this is most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
 but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
 each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”
 
then perceiving in elizabeth inclination of replying, she added,
 “unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful
 lesson:--that loss of virtue in female is irretrievable, that one
 false step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is less
 brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in
 her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”
 
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
 make any reply. mary, however, continued to console herself with such
 kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.
 
in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an
 hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
 opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to
 satisfy. after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
 of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss
 bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
 the subject by saying, “but tell all and everything about it which i
 have not already heard. give further particulars. what did colonel
 forster say? had they apprehension of anything before the elopement
 took place? they must have seen them together for ever.”
 
“colonel forster did own that had often suspected some partiality,
 especially on lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. i am so
 grieved for him. his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. he
 _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before had
 any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension
 first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”
 
“and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry? did know of
 their intending to go off? had colonel forster seen denny himself?”
 
“yes; but when questioned by _him_, denny denied knowing anything of
 their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. did not
 repeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ i am
 inclined to hope might have been misunderstood before.”
 
“and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
 doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?”
 
“how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? i felt a
 little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in
 marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
 right. my father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
 imprudent match it must be. kitty then owned, with very natural
 triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia’s last letter
 she had prepared her for such step. she had known, it seems, of their
 being in love with each other many weeks.”
 
“but not before they went to brighton?”
 
“no, i believe not.”
 
“and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself? does he
 know his real character?”
 
“i must confess that did not speak so well of wickham as formerly
 did. believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad
 affair has taken place, it is said that left meryton greatly in debt:
 but i hope this may be false.”
 
“oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
 this could not have happened!”
 
“perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.
 
“but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what
 their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”
 
“we acted with the best intentions.”
 
“could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia’s note to his
 wife?”
 
“he brought it with him for us to see.”
 
jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth. these
 were the contents:--
 
/* nind “my dear harriet, */
 
“you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help
 laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am
 missed. i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with
 who, i shall think you simpleton, for there is but one man in the
 world i love, and is an angel. i should never be happy without
 him, so think it harm to be off. you need not send them word at
 longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
 surprise the greater when i write to them, and sign my name lydia
 wickham. what good joke it will be! i can hardly write for
 laughing. pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my
 engagement, and dancing with him to-night. tell him i hope will
 excuse when knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at
 the next ball we meet with great pleasure. i shall send for my
 clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to
 mend great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed
 up. good-bye. give my love to colonel forster. i hope you will
 drink to our good journey.
 
“your affectionate friend,
 
“lydia bennet.”
 

“oh, thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!” cried elizabeth when she had
 finished it. “what letter is this, to be written at such moment! but
 at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.
 whatever might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
 _scheme_ of infamy. my poor father! how must have felt it!”
 
“i never saw anyone so shocked. could not speak word for full ten
 minutes. my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
 such confusion!”
 
“oh, jane,” cried elizabeth, “was there servant belonging to it who
 did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”
 
“i do not know: i hope there was. but to be guarded at such time is
 very difficult. my mother was in hysterics; and though i endeavoured to
 give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much
 as i might have done. but the horror of what might possibly happen
 almost took from my faculties.”
 
“your attendance upon her has been too much for you. you do not look
 well. oh that i had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
 upon yourself alone.”
 
“mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
 fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.
 kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much that her hours of
 repose should not be broken in on. my aunt philips came to longbourn on
 tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
 thursday with me. she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
 lucas has been very kind: she walked here on wednesday morning to
 condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
 they could be of use to us.”
 
“she had better have stayed at home,” cried elizabeth: “perhaps she
 _meant_ well, but, under such misfortune as this, one cannot see too
 little of one’s neighbours. assistance is impossible; condolence,
 insufferable. let them triumph over us at distance, and be satisfied.”
 
she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
 intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
 
“he meant, i believe,” replied jane, “to go to epsom, the place where
 they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could
 be made out from them. his principal object must be to discover the
 number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham. it had come
 with fare from london; and as thought the circumstance of a
 gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be
 remarked, meant to make inquiries at clapham. if could anyhow
 discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
 determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
 to find out the stand and number of the coach. i do not know of any
 other designs that had formed; but was in such hurry to be gone,
 and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding
 out even so much as this.”

the whole party were in hopes of letter from mr. bennet the next
 morning, but the post came in without bringing single line from him.
 his family knew him to be, on all common occasions, most negligent and
 dilatory correspondent; but at such time they had hoped for exertion.
 they were forced to conclude, that had pleasing intelligence to
 send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. mr.
 gardiner had waited only for the letters before set off.
 
when was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
 information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,
 to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn as soon as could, to
 the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
 security for her husband’s not being killed in duel.
 
mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire few
 days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
 her nieces. she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet, and was a
 great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. their other aunt also
 visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
 cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
 reporting some fresh instance of wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,
 she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
 them.
 
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
 before, had been almost an angel of light. was declared to be in debt
 to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
 the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.
 everybody declared that was the wickedest young man in the world; and
 everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
 appearance of his goodness. elizabeth, though she did not credit above
 half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
 her sister’s ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still
 less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
 come, when, if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before
 entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
 news of them.
 
mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a
 letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival had immediately
 found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street.
 that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but
 without gaining any satisfactory information; and that was now
 determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr. bennet
 thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
 coming to london, before they procured lodgings. mr. gardiner himself
 did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was
 eager in it, meant to assist him in pursuing it. added, that mr.
 bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london, and
 promised to write again very soon. there was also postscript to this
 effect:--
 
“i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if
 possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,
 whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
 know in what part of the town has now concealed himself. if there
 were anyone that one could apply to, with probability of gaining such
 clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. at present we have
 nothing to guide us. colonel forster will, i dare say, do everything in
 his power to satisfy us on this head. but, on second thoughts, perhaps
 lizzy could tell us what relations has now living better than any
 other person.”
 
elizabeth was at loss to understand from whence this deference for
 her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
 information of so satisfactory nature as the compliment deserved.
 
she had never heard of his having had any relations, except father
 and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. it was possible,
 however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to
 give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting
 it, the application was something to look forward to.
 
every day at longbourn was now day of anxiety; but the most anxious
 part of each was when the post was expected. the arrival of letters was
 the first grand object of every morning’s impatience. through letters,
 whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every
 succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.
 
but before they heard again from mr. gardiner, letter arrived for
 their father, from different quarter, from mr. collins; which, as jane
 had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
 she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
 letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. it was as
 follows:--
 
/* “my dear sir, */
 
“i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
 in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
 suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by letter
 from hertfordshire. be assured, my dear sir, that mrs. collins and
 myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable
 family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
 kind, because proceeding from cause which time can remove. no
 arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
 misfortune; or that may comfort you, under circumstance that
 must be, of all others, most afflicting to parent’s mind. the
 death of your daughter would have been blessing in comparison of
 this. and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
 suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
 of behaviour in your
 
[illustration:
 
“to whom i have related the affair”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
daughter has proceeded from faulty degree of indulgence; though,
 at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet,
 i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally
 bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an
 age. howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in
 which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins, but likewise by
 lady catherine and her daughter, to whom i have related the affair.
 they agree with in apprehending that this false step in one
 daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for
 who, as lady catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect
 themselves with such family? and this consideration leads me,
 moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on certain
 event of last november; for had it been otherwise, i must have been
 involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. let advise you, then,
 my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off
 your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to
 reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.
 
“i am, dear sir,” etc., etc.
 
mr. gardiner did not write again, till had received an answer from
 colonel forster; and then had nothing of pleasant nature to send.
 it was not known that wickham had single relation with whom kept up
 any connection, and it was certain that had near one living. his
 former acquaintance had been numerous; but since had been in the
 militia, it did not appear that was on terms of particular friendship
 with any of them. there was one, therefore, who could be pointed out
 as likely to give any news of him. and in the wretched state of his own
 finances, there was very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
 his fear of discovery by lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired
 that had left gaming debts behind him to very considerable amount.
 colonel forster believed that more than thousand pounds would be
 necessary to clear his expenses at brighton. owed good deal in the
 town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. mr. gardiner
 did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family;
 jane heard them with horror. “a gamester!” she cried. “this is wholly
 unexpected; i had not an idea of it.”
 
mr. gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their
 father at home on the following day, which was saturday. rendered
 spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, had yielded to
 his brother-in-law’s entreaty that would return to his family and
 leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
 for continuing their pursuit. when mrs. bennet was told of this, she did
 not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
 what her anxiety for his life had been before.
 
“what! is coming home, and without poor lydia?” she cried. “sure he
 will not leave london before has found them. who is to fight wickham,
 and make him marry her, if comes away?”
 
as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
 and her children should go to london at the same time that mr. bennet
 came from it. the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
 journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.
 
mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
 derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
 his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
 and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed, of
 their being followed by letter from him, had ended in nothing.
 elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
 pemberley.
 
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
 the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
 fairly conjectured from _that_,--though elizabeth, who was by this time
 tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
 that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of
 lydia’s infamy somewhat better. it would have spared her, she thought,
 one sleepless night out of two.
 
when mr. bennet arrived, had all the appearance of his usual
 philosophic composure. said as little as had ever been in the
 habit of saying; made mention of the business that had taken him
 away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
 it.
 
it was not till the afternoon, when joined them at tea, that
 elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
 expressing her sorrow for what must have endured, replied, “say
 nothing of that. who should suffer but myself? it has been my own doing,
 and i ought to feel it.”
 
“you must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied elizabeth.
 
“you may well warn against such an evil. human nature is so prone to
 fall into it! no, lizzy, let once in my life feel how much i have
 been to blame. i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
 it will pass away soon enough.”
 
“do you suppose them to be in london?”
 
“yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”
 
“and lydia used to want to go to london,” added kitty.
 
“she is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there
 will probably be of some duration.”
 
then, after short silence, continued, “lizzy, i bear you no
 ill-will for being justified in your advice to last may, which,
 considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”
 
they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s
 tea.
 
“this is parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an
 elegance to misfortune! another day i will do the same; i will sit in my
 library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
 i can,--or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away.”
 
“i am not going to run away, papa,” said kitty, fretfully. “if _i_
 should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia.”
 
“_you_ go to brighton! i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne,
 for fifty pounds! no, kitty, i have at least learnt to be cautious, and
 you will feel the effects of it. officer is ever to enter my house
 again, nor even to pass through the village. balls will be absolutely
 prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. and you are
 never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten
 minutes of every day in rational manner.”
 
kitty, who took all these threats in serious light, began to cry.
 
“well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. if you are good
 girl for the next ten years, i will take you to review at the end of
 them.”

chapter xlix.

two days after mr. bennet’s return, as jane and elizabeth were walking
 together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
 coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their
 mother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,
 when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, “i beg your pardon,
 madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some
 good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask.”
 
“what do you mean, hill? we have heard nothing from town.”
 
“dear madam,” cried mrs. hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know
 there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner? has been here
 this half hour, and master has had letter.”
 
away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. they
 ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
 library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
 seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the
 butler, who said,--
 
“if you are looking for my master, ma’am, is walking towards the
 little copse.”
 
upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
 and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
 pursuing his way towards small wood on one side of the paddock.
 
jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
 elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
 came up with him, and eagerly cried out,--
 
“oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”
 
“yes, i have had letter from him by express.”
 
“well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”
 
“what is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from
 his pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”
 
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. jane now came up.
 
“read it aloud,” said their father, “for i hardly know myself what it is
 about.”
 
/* right “gracechurch street, _monday, august 2_. */
 
“my dear brother,
 
“at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
 as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction. soon after
 you left on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what
 part of london they were. the particulars i reserve till we meet.
 it is enough to know they are discovered: i have seen them
 both----”
 
[illustration:
 
“but perhaps you would like to read it”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“then it is as i always hoped,” cried jane: “they are married!”
 
elizabeth read on: “i have seen them both. they are not married,
 nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
 willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on
 your side, i hope it will not be long before they are. all that is
 required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
 equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
 children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
 moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
 life, one hundred pounds per annum. these are conditions which,
 considering everything, i had hesitation in complying with, as
 far as i thought myself privileged, for you. i shall send this by
 express, that time may be lost in bringing your answer. you
 will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr. wickham’s
 circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
 be. the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to
 say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
 discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
 if, as i conclude will be the case, you send full powers to act
 in your name throughout the whole of this business, i will
 immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing proper
 settlement. there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
 to town again; therefore stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on
 my diligence and care. send back your answer as soon as you can,
 and be careful to write explicitly. we have judged it best that my
 niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will
 approve. she comes to us to-day. i shall write again as soon as
 anything more is determined on. yours, etc.
 
“edw. gardiner.”
 
“is it possible?” cried elizabeth, when she had finished. “can it be
 possible that will marry her?”
 
“wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her
 sister. “my dear father, i congratulate you.”
 
“and have you answered the letter?” said elizabeth.
 
“no; but it must be done soon.”
 
most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose more time before he
 wrote.
 
“oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.
 consider how important every moment is in such case.”
 
“let write for you,” said jane, “if you dislike the trouble
 yourself.”
 
“i dislike it very much,” replied; “but it must be done.”
 
and so saying, turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
 
“and--may i ask?” said elizabeth; “but the terms, i suppose, must be
 complied with.”
 
“complied with! i am only ashamed of his asking so little.”
 
“and they _must_ marry! yet is _such_ man.”
 
“yes, yes, they must marry. there is nothing else to be done. but there
 are two things that i want very much to know:--one is, how much money
 your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how i am ever
 to pay him.”
 
“money! my uncle!” cried jane, “what do you mean, sir?”
 
“i mean that man in his proper senses would marry lydia on so slight
 temptation as one hundred year during my life, and fifty after i am
 gone.”
 
“that is very true,” said elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me
 before. his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! oh,
 it must be my uncle’s doings! generous, good man, i am afraid has
 distressed himself. small sum could not do all this.”
 
“no,” said her father. “wickham’s fool if takes her with farthing
 less than ten thousand pounds: i should be sorry to think so ill of him,
 in the very beginning of our relationship.”
 
“ten thousand pounds! heaven forbid! how is half such sum to be
 repaid?”
 
mr. bennet made answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued
 silent till they reached the house. their father then went to the
 library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
 
“and they are really to be married!” cried elizabeth, as soon as they
 were by themselves. “how strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be
 thankful. that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
 and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! oh, lydia!”
 
“i comfort myself with thinking,” replied jane, “that certainly would
 not marry lydia, if had not real regard for her. though our kind
 uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten
 thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. has children
 of his own, and may have more. how could spare half ten thousand
 pounds?”
 
“if we are ever able to learn what wickham’s debts have been,” said
 elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
 exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them, because wickham has
 not sixpence of his own. the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
 requited. their taking her home, and affording her their personal
 protection and countenance, is such sacrifice to her advantage as
 years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. by this time she is
 actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now,
 she will never deserve to be happy! what meeting for her, when she
 first sees my aunt!”
 
“we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said
 jane: “i hope and trust they will yet be happy. his consenting to marry
 her is proof, i will believe, that is come to right way of
 thinking. their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself
 they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational manner, as may in
 time make their past imprudence forgotten.”
 
“their conduct has been such,” replied elizabeth, “as neither you, nor
 i, nor anybody, can ever forget. it is useless to talk of it.”
 
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
 perfectly ignorant of what had happened. they went to the library,
 therefore, and asked their father whether would not wish them to make
 it known to her. was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly
 replied,--
 
“just as you please.”
 
“may we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”
 
“take whatever you like, and get away.”
 
elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs
 together. mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet: one communication
 would, therefore, do for all. after slight preparation for good news,
 the letter was read aloud. mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself. as
 soon as jane had read mr. gardiner’s hope of lydia’s being soon married,
 her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
 exuberance. she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she
 had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. to know that her daughter
 would be married was enough. she was disturbed by fear for her
 felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
 
“my dear, dear lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! she will
 be married! i shall see her again! she will be married at sixteen! my
 good, kind brother! i knew how it would be--i knew would manage
 everything. how i long to see her! and to see dear wickham too! but the
 clothes, the wedding clothes! i will write to my sister gardiner about
 them directly. lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
 much will give her. stay, stay, i will go myself. ring the bell,
 kitty, for hill. i will put on my things in moment. my dear, dear
 lydia! how merry we shall be together when we meet!”
 
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
 these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr.
 gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.
 
“for we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in great
 measure to his kindness. we are persuaded that has pledged himself to
 assist mr. wickham with money.”
 
“well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but
 her own uncle? if had not had family of his own, i and my children
 must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
 ever had anything from him except few presents. well! i am so happy.
 in short time, i shall have daughter married. mrs. wickham! how well
 it sounds! and she was only sixteen last june. my dear jane, i am in
 such flutter, that i am sure i can’t write; so i will dictate, and you
 write for me. we will settle with your father about the money
 afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”
 
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
 cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
 not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
 father was at leisure to be consulted. one day’s delay, she observed,
 would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
 so obstinate as usual. other schemes, too, came into her head.
 
“i will go to meryton,” said she, “as soon as i am dressed, and tell the
 good, good news to my sister philips. and as i come back, i can call on
 lady lucas and mrs. long. kitty, run down and order the carriage. an
 airing would do great deal of good, i am sure. girls, can i do
 anything for you in meryton? oh! here comes hill. my dear hill, have you
 heard the good news? miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall
 all have bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”
 
mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy. elizabeth received her
 congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
 refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. poor lydia’s
 situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was worse, she
 had need to be thankful. she felt it so; and though, in looking forward,
 neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly
 expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only
 two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.

“the spiteful old ladies”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 



chapter l.
 

[illustration]
 
mr. bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
 instead of spending his whole income, had laid by an annual sum, for
 the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
 him. now wished it more than ever. had done his duty in that
 respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of
 honour or credit could now be purchased for her. the satisfaction of
 prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to
 be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.
 
was seriously concerned that cause of so little advantage to anyone
 should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he
 was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
 and to discharge the obligation as soon as could.
 
when first mr. bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
 useless; for, of course, they were to have son. this was to join
 in cutting off the entail, as soon as should be of age, and the widow
 and younger children would by that means be provided for. five daughters
 successively entered the world, but yet the was to come; and mrs.
 bennet, for many years after lydia’s birth, had been certain that he
 would. this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
 late to be saving. mrs. bennet had turn for economy; and her
 husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
 income.
 
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and
 the children. but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
 latter depended on the will of the parents. this was one point, with
 regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr. bennet
 could have hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. in
 terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
 expressed most concisely, then delivered on paper his perfect
 approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
 engagements that had been made for him. had never before supposed
 that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
 done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
 arrangement. would scarcely be ten pounds year the loser, by the
 hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
 allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
 through her mother’s hands, lydia’s expenses had been very little within
 that sum.
 
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
 another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have
 as little trouble in the business as possible. when the first transports
 of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
 naturally returned to all his former indolence. his letter was soon
 despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, was quick in
 its execution. begged to know further particulars of what was
 indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia to send any
 message to her.
 
the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
 speed through the neighbourhood. it was borne in the latter with decent
 philosophy. to be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of
 conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the
 happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant
 farm-house. but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
 good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from
 all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit
 in this change of circumstances, because with such husband her misery
 was considered certain.
 
it was fortnight since mrs. bennet had been down stairs, but on this
 happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
 spirits oppressively high. sentiment of shame gave damp to her
 triumph. the marriage of daughter, which had been the first object of
 her wishes since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
 accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
 attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
 servants. she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
 proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering
 what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
 importance.
 
“haye park might do,” said she, “if the gouldings would quit it, or the
 great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is
 too far off. i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
 purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful.”
 
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
 servants remained. but when they had withdrawn, said to her, “mrs.
 bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your and
 daughter, let us come to right understanding. into _one_ house in this
 neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. i will not encourage the
 imprudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn.”
 
long dispute followed this declaration; but mr. bennet was firm: it
 soon led to another; and mrs. bennet found, with amazement and horror,
 that her husband would not advance guinea to buy clothes for his
 daughter. protested that she should receive from him mark of
 affection whatever on the occasion. mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend
 it. that his anger could be carried to such point of inconceivable
 resentment as to refuse his daughter privilege, without which her
 marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
 possible. she was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new
 clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of
 shame at her eloping and living with wickham fortnight before they
 took place.
 
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
 the moment, been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for
 her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
 termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
 unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
 spot.
 
she had fear of its spreading farther, through his means. there were
 few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
 but at the same time there was one whose knowledge of sister’s
 frailty would have mortified her so much. not, however, from any fear of
 disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there
 seemed gulf impassable between them. had lydia’s marriage been
 concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
 mr. darcy would connect himself with family, where to every other
 objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest
 kind with the man whom so justly scorned.
 
from such connection she could not wonder that should shrink. the
 wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
 feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
 blow as this. she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
 hardly knew of what. she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
 longer hope to be benefited by it. she wanted to hear of him, when there
 seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. she was convinced that
 she could have been happy with him, when it was longer likely they
 should meet.
 
what triumph for him, as she often thought, could know that the
 proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now
 have been gladly and gratefully received! was as generous, she
 doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. but while was mortal,
 there must be triumph.
 
she began now to comprehend that was exactly the man who, in
 disposition and talents, would most suit her. his understanding and
 temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. it
 was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease
 and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
 and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
 have received benefit of greater importance.
 
but such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
 connubial felicity really was. an union of different tendency, and
 precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
 family.
 
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she
 could not imagine. but how little of permanent happiness could belong to
 couple who were only brought together because their passions were
 stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
 
mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. to mr. bennet’s
 acknowledgments briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
 promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
 that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. the principal
 purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr. wickham had resolved
 on quitting the militia.
 
“it was greatly my wish that should do so,” added, “as soon as his
 marriage was fixed on. and i think you will agree with me, in
 considering removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his
 account and my niece’s. it is mr. wickham’s intention to go into the
 regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are
 able and willing to assist him in the army. has the promise of an
 ensigncy in general----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. it is
 an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. he
 promises fairly; and i hope among different people, where they may each
 have character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. i have
 written to colonel forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
 and to request that will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham
 in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which i have
 pledged myself. and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
 similar assurances to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin
 list, according to his information? has given in all his debts; i
 hope at least has not deceived us. haggerston has our directions, and
 all will be completed in week. they will then join his regiment,
 unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from mrs.
 gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
 leaves the south. she is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
 you and her mother.--yours, etc.
 
“e. gardiner.”
 
mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham’s
 removal from the ----shire, as clearly as mr. gardiner could do. but
 mrs. bennet was not so well pleased with it. lydia’s being settled in
 the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
 company, for she had by means given up her plan of their residing in
 hertfordshire, was severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
 pity that lydia should be taken from regiment where she was acquainted
 with everybody, and had so many favourites.
 
“she is so fond of mrs. forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking
 to send her away! and there are several of the young men, too, that she
 likes very much. the officers may not be so pleasant in general----’s
 regiment.”
 
his daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being
 admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,
 received at first an absolute negative. but jane and elizabeth, who
 agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and
 consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
 urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
 and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that was
 prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. and their
 mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show
 her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
 the north. when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
 sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon
 as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn. elizabeth
 was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such scheme;
 and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
 would have been the last object of her wishes.

chapter li.
 

[illustration]
 
their sister’s wedding-day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her
 probably more than she felt for herself. the carriage was sent to meet
 them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. their arrival
 was dreaded by the elder miss bennets--and jane more especially, who
 gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
 been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
 must endure.
 
they came. the family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive
 them. smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet, as the carriage drove up to
 the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
 anxious, uneasy.
 
lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
 she ran into the room. her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
 welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
 wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an
 alacrity which showed doubt of their happiness.
 
their reception from mr. bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
 so cordial. his countenance rather gained in austerity; and scarcely
 opened his lips. the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
 enough to provoke him.
 
elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked. lydia was
 lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. she turned
 from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at
 length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of
 some little alteration in it, and observed, with laugh, that it was a
 great while since she had been there.
 
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners
 were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been
 exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
 claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. elizabeth
 had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat
 down, resolving within herself to draw limits in future to the
 impudence of an impudent man. _she_ blushed, and jane blushed; but the
 cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered variation of
 colour.
 
there was want of discourse. the bride and her mother could neither
 of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near
 elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
 with good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
 replies. they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
 world. nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led
 voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
 the world.
 
“only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since i went away:
 it seems but fortnight, i declare; and yet there have been things
 enough happened in the time. good gracious! when i went away, i am sure
 i had more idea of being married till i came back again! though i
 thought it would be very good fun if i was.”
 
her father lifted up his eyes, jane was distressed, elizabeth looked
 expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
 which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--
 
“oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know i am married to-day? i was
 afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle,
 so i was determined should know it, and so i let down the side glass
 next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the
 window frame, so that might see the ring, and then i bowed and
 smiled like anything.”
 
elizabeth could bear it longer. she got up and ran out of the room;
 and returned more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
 the dining-parlour. she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with
 anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to
 her eldest sister,--
 
“ah, jane, i take your place now, and you must go lower, because i am a
 married woman.”
 
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment
 from which she had been so wholly free at first. her ease and good
 spirits increased. she longed to see mrs. philips, the lucases, and all
 their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “mrs. wickham” by
 each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring
 and boast of being married to mrs. hill and the two housemaids.
 
“well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the
 breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? is not a
 charming man? i am sure my sisters must all envy me. i only hope they
 may have half my good luck. they must all go to brighton. that is the
 place to get husbands. what pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”
 
“very true; and if i had my will we should. but, my dear lydia, i don’t
 at all like your going such way off. must it be so?”
 
“oh, lord! yes; there is nothing in that. i shall like it of all things.
 you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. we shall be at
 newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some balls, and i
 will take care to get good partners for them all.”
 
“i should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.
 
“and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
 behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
 winter is over.”
 
“i thank you for my share of the favour,” said elizabeth; “but i do not
 particularly like your way of getting husbands.”
 
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. mr. wickham
 had received his commission before left london, and was to join
 his regiment at the end of fortnight.
 
one but mrs. bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
 she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
 having very frequent parties at home. these parties were acceptable to
 all; to avoid family circle was even more desirable to such as did
 think than such as did not.
 
wickham’s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to
 find it; not equal to lydia’s for him. she had scarcely needed her
 present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
 their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
 than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
 for her, chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
 that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
 if that were the case, was not the young man to resist an opportunity
 of having companion.
 
lydia was exceedingly fond of him. was her dear wickham on every
 occasion; one was to be put in competition with him. did
 everything best in the world; and she was sure would kill more birds
 on the first of september than anybody else in the country.
 
one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
 elder sisters, she said to elizabeth,--
 
“lizzy, i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, i believe. you were
 not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it. are not you
 curious to hear how it was managed?”
 
“no, really,” replied elizabeth; “i think there cannot be too little
 said on the subject.”
 
“la! you are so strange! but i must tell you how it went off. we were
 married, you know, at st. clement’s, because wickham’s lodgings were in
 that parish. and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
 o’clock. my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others
 were to meet us at the church.
 
“well, monday morning came, and i was in such fuss! i was so afraid,
 you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then i should
 have gone quite distracted. and there was my aunt, all the time i was
 dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a
 sermon. however, i did not hear above one word in ten, for i was
 thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham. i longed to know whether
 would be married in his blue coat.
 
“well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: i thought it would never
 be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt
 were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them. if you’ll believe
 me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a
 fortnight. not one party, or scheme, or anything! to be sure, london was
 rather thin, but, however, the little theatre was open.
 
“well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was
 called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone. and then, you
 know, when once they get together, there is end of it. well, i was so
 frightened i did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give away;
 and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. but,
 luckily, came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set
 out. however, i recollected afterwards, that if _had_ been prevented
 going, the wedding need not be put off, for mr. darcy might have done as
 well.”
 
“mr. darcy!” repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.
 
“oh, yes! was to come there with wickham, you know. but, gracious me!
 i quite forgot! i ought not to have said word about it. i promised
 them so faithfully! what will wickham say? it was to be such secret!”
 
“if it was to be secret,” said jane, “say not another word on the
 subject. you may depend upon my seeking further.”
 
“oh, certainly,” said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will
 ask you questions.”
 
“thank you,” said lydia; “for if you did, i should certainly tell you
 all, and then wickham would be so angry.”
 
on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
 power, by running away.
 
but to live in ignorance on such point was impossible; or at least it
 was impossible not to try for information. mr. darcy had been at her
 sister’s wedding. it was exactly scene, and exactly among people,
 where had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
 conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
 brain; but she was satisfied with none. those that best pleased her, as
 placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. she
 could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing sheet of paper,
 wrote short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
 lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
 intended.
 
“you may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to
 know how person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively
 speaking, stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
 time. pray write instantly, and let understand it--unless it is,
 for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to
 think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
 ignorance.”
 
“not that i _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the
 letter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell in an honourable
 manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
 out.”
 
jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
 elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of
 it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
 satisfaction, she had rather be without confidante.

elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
 soon as she possibly could. she was sooner in possession of it, than
 hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
 interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
 happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
 contain denial.
 
/* right “gracechurch street, _sept. 6_. */
 
“my dear niece,
 
“i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
 morning to answering it, as i foresee that _little_ writing will
 not comprise what i have to tell you. i must confess myself
 surprised by your application; i did not expect it from _you_.
 don’t think angry, however, for i only mean to let you know,
 that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_
 side. if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
 impertinence. your uncle is as much surprised as i am; and nothing
 but the belief of your being party concerned would have allowed
 him to act as has done. but if you are really innocent and
 ignorant, i must be more explicit. on the very day of my coming
 home from longbourn, your uncle had most unexpected visitor. mr.
 darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. it was all
 over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
 as _yours_ seems to have been. came to tell mr. gardiner that he
 had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were, and that he
 had seen and talked with them both--wickham repeatedly, lydia once.
 from what i can collect, left derbyshire only one day after
 ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
 them. the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
 himself that wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as
 to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or
 confide in him. generously imputed the whole to his mistaken
 pride, and confessed that had before thought it beneath him to
 lay his private actions open to the world. his character was to
 speak for itself. called it, therefore, his duty to step
 forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on
 by himself. if _had another_ motive, i am sure it would never
 disgrace him. had been some days in town before was able to
 discover them; but had something to direct his search, which was
 more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another
 reason for his resolving to follow us. there is lady, it seems, a
 mrs. younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was
 dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
 did not say what. she then took large house in edward street,
 and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. this mrs.
 younge was, knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he
 went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as got to town. but
 it was two or three days before could get from her what he
 wanted. she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery
 and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
 found. wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in
 london; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
 would have taken up their abode with her. at length, however, our
 kind friend procured the wished-for direction. they were in ----
 street. saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.
 his first object with her, acknowledged, had been to persuade
 her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
 friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
 offering his assistance as far as it would go. but found lydia
 absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. she cared for none
 of her friends; she wanted help of his; she would not hear of
 leaving wickham. she was sure they should be married some time or
 other, and it did not much signify when. since such were her
 feelings, it only remained, thought, to secure and expedite a
 marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he
 easily learnt had never been _his_ design. confessed himself
 obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour
 which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill
 consequences of lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. meant to
 resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,
 could conjecture very little about it. must go somewhere, but
 did not know where, and knew should have nothing to live
 on. mr. darcy asked why did not marry your sister at once.
 though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich, would have
 been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been
 benefited by marriage. but found, in reply to this question,
 that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making
 his fortune by marriage, in some other country. under such
 circumstances, however, was not likely to be proof against the
 temptation of immediate relief. they met several times, for there
 was much to be discussed. wickham, of course, wanted more than he
 could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. everything
 being settled between _them_, mr. darcy’s next step was to make
 your uncle acquainted with it, and first called in gracechurch
 street the evening before i came home. but mr. gardiner could not
 be seen; and mr. darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father
 was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. did
 not judge your father to be person whom could so properly
 consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him
 till after the departure of the former. did not leave his name,
 and till the next day it was only known that gentleman had called
 on business. on saturday came again. your father was gone, your
 uncle at home, and, as i said before, they had great deal of talk
 together. they met again on sunday, and then _i_ saw him too. it
 was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express
 was sent off to longbourn. but our visitor was very obstinate. i
 fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,
 after all. has been accused of many faults at different times;
 but _this_ is the true one. nothing was to be done that did not
 do himself; though i am sure (and i do not speak it to be thanked,
 therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have
 settled the whole. they battled it together for long time, which
 was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it
 deserved. but at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead
 of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up
 with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely
 against the grain; and i really believe your letter this morning
 gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that
 would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
 it was due. but, lizzy, this must go further than yourself, or
 jane at most. you know pretty well, i suppose, what has been done
 for the young people. his debts are to be paid, amounting, i
 believe, to considerably more than thousand pounds, another
 thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
 commission purchased. the reason why all this was to be done by him
 alone, was such as i have given above. it was owing to him, to his
 reserve and want of proper consideration, that wickham’s character
 had been so misunderstood, and consequently that had been
 received and noticed as was. perhaps there was some truth in
 _this_; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_
 reserve can be answerable for the event. but in spite of all this
 fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that
 your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
 for _another interest_ in the affair. when all this was resolved
 on, returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
 pemberley; but it was agreed that should be in london once more
 when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
 receive the last finish. i believe i have now told you everything.
 it is relation which you tell is to give you great surprise; i
 hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. lydia came to
 us, and wickham had constant admission to the house. _he_ was
 exactly what had been when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i
 would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
 while she stayed with us, if i had not perceived, by jane’s letter
 last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
 piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you can give you no
 fresh pain. i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
 representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all
 the unhappiness she had brought on her family. if she heard me, it
 was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen. i was sometimes
 quite provoked; but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane,
 and for their sakes had patience with her. mr. darcy was punctual
 in his return, and, as lydia informed you, attended the wedding. he
 dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on
 wednesday or thursday. will you be very angry with me, my dear
 lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold
 enough to say before) how much i like him? his behaviour to us has,
 in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.
 his understanding and opinions all please me; wants nothing but
 little more liveliness, and _that_, if marry _prudently_, his
 wife may teach him. i thought him very sly; hardly ever
 mentioned your name. but slyness seems the fashion. pray forgive
 me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish so
 far as to exclude from p. i shall never be quite happy till i
 have been all round the park. low phaeton with nice little pair
 of ponies would be the very thing. but i must write more. the
 children have been wanting this half hour.
 
“yours, very sincerely,
 
“m. gardiner.”
 

the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into flutter of spirits,
 in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
 greatest share. the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
 produced, of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her
 sister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of
 goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be
 just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest
 extent to be true! had followed them purposely to town, had taken
 on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a
 research; in which supplication had been necessary to woman whom he
 must abominate and despise, and where was reduced to meet, frequently
 meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom always
 most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to
 pronounce. had done all this for girl whom could neither regard
 nor esteem. her heart did whisper that had done it for her. but it
 was hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt
 that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his
 affection for her, for woman who had already refused him, as able to
 overcome sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with
 wickham. brother-in-law of wickham! every kind of pride must revolt from
 the connection. had, to be sure, done much. she was ashamed to think
 how much. but had given reason for his interference, which asked no
 extraordinary stretch of belief. it was reasonable that should feel
 had been wrong; had liberality, and had the means of exercising
 it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
 she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might
 assist his endeavours in cause where her peace of mind must be
 materially concerned. it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
 they were under obligations to person who could never receive a
 return. they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, everything to
 him. oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she
 had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards
 him! for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that
 in cause of compassion and honour had been able to get the better
 of himself. she read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and
 again. it was hardly enough; but it pleased her. she was even sensible
 of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly
 both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence
 subsisted between mr. darcy and herself.
 
she was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;
 and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by
 wickham.
 
“i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,
 as joined her.
 
“you certainly do,” she replied with smile; “but it does not follow
 that the interruption must be unwelcome.”
 
“i should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _we_ were always good friends,
 and now we are better.”
 
“true. are the others coming out?”
 
“i do not know. mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
 meryton. and so, my dear sister, i find, from our uncle and aunt, that
 you have actually seen pemberley.”
 
she replied in the affirmative.
 
“i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much
 for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle. and you saw the
 old housekeeper, i suppose? poor reynolds, she was always very fond of
 me. but of course she did not mention my name to you.”
 
“yes, she did.”
 
“and what did she say?”
 
“that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
 out well. at such distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
 misrepresented.”
 
“certainly,” replied, biting his lips. elizabeth hoped she had
 silenced him; but soon afterwards said,--
 
“i was surprised to see darcy in town last month. we passed each other
 several times. i wonder what can be doing there.”
 
“perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss bourgh,” said
 elizabeth. “it must be something particular to take him there at this
 time of year.”
 
“undoubtedly. did you see him while you were at lambton? i thought i
 understood from the gardiners that you had.”
 
“yes; introduced us to his sister.”
 
“and do you like her?”
 
“very much.”
 
“i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
 or two. when i last saw her, she was not very promising. i am very glad
 you liked her. i hope she will turn out well.”
 
“i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”
 
“did you go by the village of kympton?”
 
“i do not recollect that we did.”
 
“i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had. most
 delightful place! excellent parsonage-house! it would have suited in
 every respect.”
 
“how should you have liked making sermons?”
 
“exceedingly well. i should have considered it as part of my duty, and
 the exertion would soon have been nothing. one ought not to repine; but,
 to be sure, it would have been such thing for me! the quiet, the
 retirement of such life, would have answered all my ideas of
 happiness! but it was not to be. did you ever hear darcy mention the
 circumstance when you were in kent?”
 
“i _have_ heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was
 left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”
 
“you have! yes, there was something in _that_; i told you so from the
 first, you may remember.”
 
“i _did_ hear, too, that there was time when sermon-making was not so
 palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
 declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
 had been compromised accordingly.”
 
“you did! and it was not wholly without foundation. you may remember
 what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”
 
they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
 to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,
 she only said in reply, with good-humoured smile,--
 
“come, mr. wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. do not let us
 quarrel about the past. in future, i hope we shall be always of one
 mind.”
 
she held out her hand: kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
 hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.

mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
 never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth,
 by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
 had said enough to keep him quiet.
 
the day of his and lydia’s departure soon came; and mrs. bennet was
 forced to submit to separation, which, as her husband by means
 entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to
 continue at least twelvemonth.
 
“oh, my dear lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”
 
“oh, lord! i don’t know. not these two or three years, perhaps.”
 
“write to very often, my dear.”
 
“as often as i can. but you know married women have never much time for
 writing. my sisters may write to _me_. they will have nothing else to
 do.”
 
mr. wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. he
 smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
 
“he is as fine fellow,” said mr. bennet, as soon as they were out of
 the house, “as ever i saw. simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
 all. i am prodigiously proud of him. i defy even sir william lucas
 himself to produce more valuable son-in-law.”
 
the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days.
 
“i often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with
 one’s friends. one seems so forlorn without them.”
 
“this is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying daughter,” said
 elizabeth. “it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
 single.”
 
“it is such thing. lydia does not leave because she is married;
 but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. if
 that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”
 
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
 relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
 article of news which then began to be in circulation. the housekeeper
 at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
 master, who was coming down in day or two, to shoot there for several
 weeks. mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets. she looked at jane, and
 smiled, and shook her head, by turns.
 
“well, well, and so mr. bingley is coming down, sister,” (for mrs.
 philips first brought her the news). “well, so much the better. not that
 i care about it, though. is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure i
 never want to see him again. but, however, is very welcome to come to
 netherfield, if likes it. and who knows what _may_ happen? but that
 is nothing to us. you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention
 word about it. and so, it is quite certain is coming?”
 
“you may depend on it,” replied the other, “for mrs. nichols was in
 meryton last night: i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
 to know the truth of it; and she told that it was certainly true. he
 comes down on thursday, at the latest, very likely on wednesday. she was
 going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
 wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”
 
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
 colour. it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
 elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--
 
“i saw you look at to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
 report; and i know i appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from
 any silly cause. i was only confused for the moment, because i felt that
 i _should_ be looked at. i do assure you that the news does not affect
 either with pleasure or pain. i am glad of one thing, that comes
 alone; because we shall see the less of him. not that i am afraid of
 _myself_, but i dread other people’s remarks.”
 
elizabeth did not know what to make of it. had she not seen him in
 derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
 other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
 to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
 there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come
 without it.
 
“yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come
 to house, which has legally hired, without raising all this
 speculation! i _will_ leave him to himself.”
 
in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
 feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily
 perceive that her spirits were affected by it. they were more disturbed,
 more unequal, than she had often seen them.
 
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
 about twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
 
“as soon as ever mr. bingley comes, my dear,” said mrs. bennet, “you
 will wait on him, of course.”
 
“no, no. you forced into visiting him last year, and promised, if i
 went to see him, should marry one of my daughters. but it ended in
 nothing, and i will not be sent on fool’s errand again.”
 
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
 would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
 netherfield.
 
“’tis an _etiquette_ i despise,” said he. “if wants our society, let
 him seek it. knows where we live. i will not spend _my_ hours in
 running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
 again.”
 
“well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
 on him. but, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, i
 am determined. we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon. that will
 make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
 him.”
 
consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
 husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
 neighbours might all see mr. bingley, in consequence of it, before
 _they_ did. as the day of his arrival drew near,--
 
“i begin to be sorry that comes at all,” said jane to her sister. “it
 would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference; but i can
 hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. my mother means well;
 but she does not know, one can know, how much i suffer from what she
 says. happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over!”
 
“i wish i could say anything to comfort you,” replied elizabeth; “but it
 is wholly out of my power. you must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
 of preaching patience to sufferer is denied me, because you have
 always so much.”
 
mr. bingley arrived. mrs. bennet, through the assistance of servants,
 contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
 and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. she counted the days
 that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of
 seeing him before. but on the third morning after his arrival in
 hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the
 paddock, and ride towards the house.
 
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. jane resolutely
 kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
 to the window--she looked--she saw mr. darcy with him, and sat down
 again by her sister.
 
“there is gentleman with him, mamma,” said kitty; “who can it be?”
 
“some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not
 know.”
 
“la!” replied kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with
 him before. mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”
 
“good gracious! mr. darcy!--and so it does, i vow. well, any friend of
 mr. bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else i must
 say that i hate the very sight of him.”
 
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern. she knew but little
 of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
 which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
 after receiving his explanatory letter. both sisters were uncomfortable
 enough. each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
 mother talked on of her dislike of mr. darcy, and her resolution to be
 civil to him only as mr. bingley’s friend, without being heard by either
 of them. but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be
 suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs.
 gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards
 him. to jane, could be only man whose proposals she had refused,
 and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
 information, was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
 for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
 interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
 what jane felt for bingley. her astonishment at his coming--at his
 coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
 was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
 behaviour in derbyshire.
 
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
 minute with an additional glow, and smile of delight added lustre to
 her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
 wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.
 
“let first see how behaves,” said she; “it will then be early
 enough for expectation.”
 
she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
 lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
 sister as the servant was approaching the door. jane looked little
 paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected. on the
 gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
 tolerable ease, and with propriety of behaviour equally free from any
 symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.
 
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
 again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. she
 had ventured only one glance at darcy. looked serious as usual; and,
 she thought, more as had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as
 she had seen him at pemberley. but, perhaps, could not in her
 mother’s presence be what was before her uncle and aunt. it was a
 painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.
 
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
 saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. was received by mrs.
 bennet with degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
 especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
 her courtesy and address of his friend.
 
elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
 preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
 hurt and distressed to most painful degree by distinction so ill
 applied.
 
darcy, after inquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did--a question
 which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. he
 was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
 it had not been so in derbyshire. there had talked to her friends
 when could not to herself. but now several minutes elapsed, without
 bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
 the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
 found him looking at jane as at herself, and frequently on object but
 the ground. more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
 they last met, were plainly expressed. she was disappointed, and angry
 with herself for being so.
 
“could i expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “yet why did come?”
 
she was in humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
 him she had hardly courage to speak.
 
she inquired after his sister, but could do more.
 
“it is long time, mr. bingley, since you went away,” said mrs. bennet.
 
readily agreed to it.
 
“i began to be afraid you would never come back again. people _did_ say,
 you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope
 it is not true. great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
 since you went away. miss lucas is married and settled: and one of my
 own daughters. i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
 seen it in the papers. it was in the ‘times’ and the ‘courier,’ i know;
 though it was not put in as it ought to be. it was only said, ‘lately,
 george wickham, esq., to miss lydia bennet,’ without there being a
 syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
 it was my brother gardiner’s drawing up, too, and i wonder how came
 to make such an awkward business of it. did you see it?”
 
bingley replied that did, and made his congratulations. elizabeth
 dared not lift up her eyes. how mr. darcy looked, therefore, she could
 not tell.
 
“it is delightful thing, to be sure, to have daughter well married,”
 continued her mother; “but at the same time, mr. bingley, it is very
 hard to have her taken away from me. they are gone down to newcastle, a
 place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, i do not
 know how long. his regiment is there; for i suppose you have heard of
 his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.
 thank heaven! has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he
 deserves.”
 
elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy, was in such misery
 of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. it drew from her, however,
 the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done
 before; and she asked bingley whether meant to make any stay in the
 country at present. few weeks, believed.
 
“when you have killed all your own birds, mr. bingley,” said her mother,
 “i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr.
 bennet’s manor. i am sure will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
 will save all the best of the coveys for you.”
 
elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious
 attention! were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
 flattered them year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be
 hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. at that instant she felt,
 that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for
 moments of such painful confusion.
 
“the first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be
 in company with either of them. their society can afford pleasure
 that will atone for such wretchedness as this! let never see either
 one or the other again!”
 
yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
 compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
 how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former
 lover. when first came in, had spoken to her but little, but every
 five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. found her
 as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as
 unaffected, though not quite so chatty. jane was anxious that no
 difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
 that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,
 that she did not always know when she was silent.
 
when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs. bennet was mindful of her
 intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
 longbourn in few days’ time.
 
“you are quite visit in my debt, mr. bingley,” she added; “for when
 you went to town last winter, you promised to take family dinner with
 us as soon as you returned. i have not forgot, you see; and i assure you
 i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your
 engagement.”
 
bingley looked little silly at this reflection, and said something of
 his concern at having been prevented by business. they then went away.
 
mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
 there that day; but, though she always kept very good table, she did
 not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for man
 on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
 of one who had ten thousand year.

as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
 or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects
 which must deaden them more. mr. darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed
 her.
 
“why, if came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,
 “did come at all?”
 
she could settle it in way that gave her pleasure.
 
“he could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he
 was in town; and why not to me? if fears me, why come hither? if he
 longer cares for me, why silent? teasing, teasing man! i will think
 more about him.”
 
her resolution was for short time involuntarily kept by the approach
 of her sister, who joined her with cheerful look which showed her
 better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth.
 
“now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly
 easy. i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by
 his coming. i am glad dines here on tuesday. it will then be publicly
 seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent
 acquaintance.”
 
“yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said elizabeth, laughingly. “oh, jane!
 take care.”
 
“my dear lizzy, you cannot think so weak as to be in danger now.”
 
“i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
 you as ever.”
 
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs. bennet, in
 the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the
 good-humour and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour’s visit,
 had revived.
 
on tuesday there was large party assembled at longbourn; and the two
 who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
 sportsmen, were in very good time. when they repaired to the
 dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
 the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
 her sister. her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
 invite him to sit by herself. on entering the room, seemed to
 hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
 decided. placed himself by her.
 
elizabeth, with triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. he
 bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that
 bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
 likewise turned towards mr. darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
 alarm.
 
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an
 admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
 elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, jane’s happiness, and his
 own, would be speedily secured. though she dared not depend upon the
 consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. it
 gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
 cheerful humour. mr. darcy was almost as far from her as the table
 could divide them. was on one side of her mother. she knew how little
 such situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
 advantage. she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but
 she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
 cold was their manner whenever they did. her mother’s ungraciousness
 made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth’s mind;
 and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
 him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
 the family.
 
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
 bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
 without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,
 than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. anxious and
 uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen
 came, was wearisome and dull to degree that almost made her uncivil.
 she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her
 chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
 
“if does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “i shall give him up for
 ever.”
 
the gentlemen came; and she thought looked as if would have
 answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
 where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
 in so close confederacy, that there was not single vacancy near her
 which would admit of chair. and on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of
 the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in whisper,--
 
“the men shan’t come and part us, i am determined. we want none of them;
 do we?”
 
darcy had walked away to another part of the room. she followed him with
 her eyes, envied everyone to whom spoke, had scarcely patience enough
 to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for
 being so silly!
 
“a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to
 expect renewal of his love? is there one among the sex who would not
 protest against such weakness as second proposal to the same woman?
 there is indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”
 
she was little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup
 himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--
 
“is your sister at pemberley still?”
 
“yes; she will remain there till christmas.”
 
“and quite alone? have all her friends left her?”
 
“mrs. annesley is with her. the others have been gone on to scarborough
 these three weeks.”
 
she could think of nothing more to say; but if wished to converse
 with her, might have better success. stood by her, however, for
 some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering
 to elizabeth again, walked away.
 
when the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
 all rose; and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
 all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall victim to her
 mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in few moments after seated
 with the rest of the party. she now lost every expectation of pleasure.
 they were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had
 nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
 of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
 
mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
 supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the
 others, and she had opportunity of detaining them.
 
“well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what
 say you to the day? i think everything has passed off uncommonly well, i
 assure you. the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw. the
 venison was roasted to turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
 haunch. the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
 lucases’ last week; and even mr. darcy acknowledged that the partridges
 were remarkably well done; and i suppose has two or three french
 cooks at least. and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater
 beauty. mrs. long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not. and
 what do you think she said besides? ‘ah! mrs. bennet, we shall have her
 at netherfield at last!’ she did, indeed. i do think mrs. long is as
 good creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved
 girls, and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously.”
 
[illustration:
 
“m^{rs}. long and her nieces.”

mrs. bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of
 bingley’s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at
 last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in happy
 humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
 not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
 
“it has been very agreeable day,” said miss bennet to elizabeth. “the
 party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. i hope we
 may often meet again.”
 
elizabeth smiled.
 
“lizzy, you must not do so. you must not suspect me. it mortifies me. i
 assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
 agreeable and sensible young man without having wish beyond it. i am
 perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that never had
 any design of engaging my affection. it is only that is blessed with
 greater sweetness of address, and stronger desire of generally
 pleasing, than any other man.”
 
“you are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let smile, and
 are provoking to it every moment.”
 
“how hard it is in some cases to be believed! and how impossible in
 others! but why should you wish to persuade that i feel more than i
 acknowledge?”
 
“that is question which i hardly know how to answer. we all love to
 instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. forgive
 me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
 confidante.”

chapter lv.
 

[illustration]
 
few days after this visit, mr. bingley called again, and alone. his
 friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in
 ten days’ time. sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
 good spirits. mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
 expressions of concern, confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
 
“next time you call,” said she, “i hope we shall be more lucky.”
 
should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she
 would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on
 them.
 
“can you come to-morrow?”
 
yes, had engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
 accepted with alacrity.
 
came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
 dressed. in ran mrs. bennet to her daughters’ room, in her
 dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--
 
“my dear jane, make haste and hurry down. is come--mr. bingley is
 come. is, indeed. make haste, make haste. here, sarah, come to miss
 bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. never mind miss
 lizzy’s hair.”
 
“we will be down as soon as we can,” said jane; “but i dare say kitty is
 forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”
 
“oh! hang kitty! what has she to do with it? come, be quick, be quick!
 where is your sash, my dear?”
 
but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down
 without one of her sisters.
 
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
 evening. after tea, mr. bennet retired to the library, as was his
 custom, and mary went upstairs to her instrument. two obstacles of the
 five being thus removed, mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at
 elizabeth and catherine for considerable time, without making any
 impression on them. elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
 kitty did, she very innocently said, “what is the matter, mamma? what do
 you keep winking at for? what am i to do?”
 
“nothing, child, nothing. i did not wink at you.” she then sat still
 five minutes longer; but unable to waste such precious occasion, she
 suddenly got up, and saying to kitty,--
 
“come here, my love, i want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.
 jane instantly gave look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such
 premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. in a
 few minutes, mrs. bennet half opened the door and called out,--
 
“lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you.”
 
elizabeth was forced to go.
 
“we may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as
 soon as she was in the hall. “kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in
 my dressing-room.”
 
elizabeth made attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
 quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned
 into the drawing-room.
 
mrs. bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. bingley was
 everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her
 daughter. his ease and cheerfulness rendered him most agreeable
 addition to their evening party; and bore with the ill-judged
 officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a
 forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the
 daughter.
 
scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before went away
 an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs. bennet’s
 means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
 
after this day, jane said more of her indifference. not word passed
 between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in the
 happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr. darcy
 returned within the stated time. seriously, however, she felt tolerably
 persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s
 concurrence.
 
bingley was punctual to his appointment; and and mr. bennet spent the
 morning together, as had been agreed on. the latter was much more
 agreeable than his companion expected. there was nothing of presumption
 or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
 silence; and was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
 other had ever seen him. bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
 and in the evening mrs. bennet’s invention was again at work to get
 everybody away from him and her daughter. elizabeth, who had letter to
 write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for
 as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
 wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.
 
but on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,
 she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her
 mother had been too ingenious for her. on opening the door, she
 perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as
 if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to suspicion,
 the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each
 other, would have told it all. _their_ situation was awkward enough; but
 _hers_ she thought was still worse. not syllable was uttered by
 either; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when
 bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,
 whispering few words to her sister, ran out of the room.
 
jane could have reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give
 pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
 emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
 
“’tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. i do not deserve it. oh,
 why is not everybody as happy?”
 
elizabeth’s congratulations were given with sincerity, warmth, a
 delight, which words could but poorly express. every sentence of
 kindness was fresh source of happiness to jane. but she would not
 allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
 said, for the present.
 
“i must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “i would not on any
 account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it
 from anyone but myself. is gone to my father already. oh, lizzy, to
 know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
 family! how shall i bear so much happiness?”
 
she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
 card-party, and was sitting upstairs with kitty.
 
elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
 with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
 previous months of suspense and vexation.
 
“and this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious
 circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the
 happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”
 
in few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her
 father had been short and to the purpose.
 
“where is your sister?” said hastily, as opened the door.
 
“with my mother upstairs. she will be down in moment, i dare say.”
 
then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
 and affection of sister. elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
 delight in the prospect of their relationship. they shook hands with
 great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
 to all had to say of his own happiness, and of jane’s perfections;
 and in spite of his being lover, elizabeth really believed all his
 expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
 basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of
 jane, and general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
 himself.
 
it was an evening of common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
 miss bennet’s mind gave such glow of sweet animation to her face, as
 made her look handsomer than ever. kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
 her turn was coming soon. mrs. bennet could not give her consent, or
 speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
 though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
 mr. bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
 how really happy was.
 
not word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
 visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as was gone, he
 turned to his daughter and said,--
 
“jane, i congratulate you. you will be very happy woman.”
 
jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
 goodness.
 
“you are good girl,” replied, “and i have great pleasure in
 thinking you will be so happily settled. i have not doubt of your
 doing very well together. your tempers are by means unlike. you are
 each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
 easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
 always exceed your income.”
 
“i hope not so. imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
 unpardonable in _me_.”
 
“exceed their income! my dear mr. bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you
 talking of? why, has four or five thousand year, and very likely
 more.” then addressing her daughter, “oh, my dear, dear jane, i am so
 happy! i am sure i shan’t get wink of sleep all night. i knew how it
 would be. i always said it must be so, at last. i was sure you could not
 be so beautiful for nothing! i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when
 first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was
 that you should come together. oh, is the handsomest young man that
 ever was seen!”
 
wickham, lydia, were all forgotten. jane was beyond competition her
 favourite child. at that moment she cared for other. her younger
 sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
 which she might in future be able to dispense.
 
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty
 begged very hard for few balls there every winter.
 
bingley, from this time, was of course daily visitor at longbourn;
 coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
 supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
 detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which thought
 himself obliged to accept.
 
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
 while was present jane had attention to bestow on anyone else: but
 she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of
 separation that must sometimes occur. in the absence of jane, always
 attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and
 when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief.
 
“he has made so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling that he
 was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! i had not believed
 it possible.”
 
“i suspected as much,” replied elizabeth. “but how did account for
 it?”
 
“it must have been his sisters’ doing. they were certainly friends to
 his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since might have
 chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. but when they see,
 as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
 learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we
 can never be what we once were to each other.”
 
“that is the most unforgiving speech,” said elizabeth, “that i ever
 heard you utter. good girl! it would vex me, indeed, to see you again
 the dupe of miss bingley’s pretended regard.”
 
“would you believe it, lizzy, that when went to town last november he
 really loved me, and nothing but persuasion of _my_ being indifferent
 would have prevented his coming down again?”
 
“he made little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
 modesty.”
 
this naturally introduced panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and
 the little value put on his own good qualities.
 
elizabeth was pleased to find that had not betrayed the interference
 of his friend; for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving
 heart in the world, she knew it was circumstance which must prejudice
 her against him.
 
“i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried
 jane. “oh, lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed
 above them all? if i could but see you as happy! if there were but such
 another man for you!”
 
“if you were to give forty such men i never could be so happy as you.
 till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your
 happiness. no, no, let shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very
 good luck, i may meet with another mr. collins in time.”
 
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
 secret. mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. philips, and
 she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
 neighbours in meryton.
 
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
 world; though only few weeks before, when lydia had first run away,
 they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.

one morning, about week after bingley’s engagement with jane had been
 formed, as and the females of the family were sitting together in the
 dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the
 sound of carriage; and they perceived chaise and four driving up the
 lawn. it was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the
 equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. the horses
 were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
 preceded it, were familiar to them. as it was certain, however, that
 somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
 the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
 shrubbery. they both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three
 continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
 open, and their visitor entered. it was lady catherine bourgh.
 
they were of course all intending to be surprised: but their
 astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs.
 bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
 inferior to what elizabeth felt.
 
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
 other reply to elizabeth’s salutation than slight inclination of the
 head, and sat down without saying word. elizabeth had mentioned her
 name to her mother on her ladyship’s entrance, though request of
 introduction had been made.
 
mrs. bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having guest of such
 high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. after sitting
 for moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to elizabeth,--
 
“i hope you are well, miss bennet. that lady, i suppose, is your
 mother?”
 
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
 
“and _that_, i suppose, is one of your sisters?”
 
“yes, madam,” said mrs. bennet, delighted to speak to lady catherine.
 “she is my youngest girl but one. my youngest of all is lately married,
 and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with young man,
 who, i believe, will soon become part of the family.”
 
“you have very small park here,” returned lady catherine, after a
 short silence.
 
“it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but, i
 assure you, it is much larger than sir william lucas’s.”
 
“this must be most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in
 summer: the windows are full west.”
 
mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
 added,--
 
“may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and
 mrs. collins well?”
 
“yes, very well. i saw them the night before last.”
 
elizabeth now expected that she would produce letter for her from
 charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. but no
 letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
 
mrs. bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
 refreshment: but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
 declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to elizabeth,--
 
“miss bennet, there seemed to be prettyish kind of little wilderness
 on one side of your lawn. i should be glad to take turn in it, if you
 will favour with your company.”
 
“go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the
 different walks. i think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”
 
elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,
 attended her noble guest downstairs. as they passed through the hall,
 lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
 drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after short survey, to be
 decent-looking rooms, walked on.
 
her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her
 waiting-woman was in it. they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
 that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make effort for
 conversation with woman who was now more than usually insolent and
 disagreeable.

“how could i ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in
 her face.
 
as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following
 manner:--
 
“you can be at loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my
 journey hither. your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
 come.”
 
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
 
“indeed, you are mistaken, madam; i have not been at all able to account
 for the honour of seeing you here.”
 
“miss bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to
 know that i am not to be trifled with. but however insincere _you_ may
 choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. my character has ever been
 celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in cause of such
 moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it. report of most
 alarming nature reached two days ago. i was told, that not only your
 sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
 _you_--that miss elizabeth bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon
 afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, mr. darcy. though i
 _know_ it must be scandalous falsehood, though i would not injure him
 so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on
 setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to
 you.”
 
“if you believed it impossible to be true,” said elizabeth, colouring
 with astonishment and disdain, “i wonder you took the trouble of coming
 so far. what could your ladyship propose by it?”
 
“at once to insist upon having such report universally contradicted.”
 
“your coming to longbourn, to see and my family,” said elizabeth
 coolly, “will be rather confirmation of it--if, indeed, such report
 is in existence.”
 
“if! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? has it not been
 industriously circulated by yourselves? do you not know that such a
 report is spread abroad?”
 
“i never heard that it was.”
 
“and can you likewise declare, that there is _foundation_ for it?”
 
“i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. _you_
 may ask questions which _i_ shall not choose to answer.”
 
“this is not to be borne. miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied. has
 he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”
 
“your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”
 
“it ought to be so; it must be so, while retains the use of his
 reason. but _your_ arts and allurements may, in moment of infatuation,
 have made him forget what owes to himself and to all his family. you
 may have drawn him in.”
 
“if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it.”
 
“miss bennet, do you know who i am? i have not been accustomed to such
 language as this. i am almost the nearest relation has in the world,
 and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”
 
“but you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
 this ever induce to be explicit.”
 
“let be rightly understood. this match, to which you have the
 presumption to aspire, can never take place. no, never. mr. darcy is
 engaged to _my daughter_. now, what have you to say?”
 
“only this,--that if is so, you can have reason to suppose will
 make an offer to me.”
 
lady catherine hesitated for moment, and then replied,--
 
“the engagement between them is of peculiar kind. from their infancy,
 they have been intended for each other. it was the favourite wish of
 _his_ mother, as well as of hers. while in their cradles we planned the
 union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be
 accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by young woman of
 inferior birth, of importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
 the family? do you pay regard to the wishes of his friends--to his
 tacit engagement with miss bourgh? are you lost to every feeling of
 propriety and delicacy? have you not heard say, that from his
 earliest hours was destined for his cousin?”
 
“yes; and i had heard it before. but what is that to me? if there is no
 other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be
 kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
 miss bourgh. you both did as much as you could in planning the
 marriage. its completion depended on others. if mr. darcy is neither by
 honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not to make
 another choice? and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?”
 
“because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. yes, miss
 bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
 friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. you will
 be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
 your alliance will be disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
 by any of us.”
 
“these are heavy misfortunes,” replied elizabeth. “but the wife of mr.
 darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
 attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have cause
 to repine.”
 
“obstinate, headstrong girl! i am ashamed of you! is this your gratitude
 for my attentions to you last spring? is nothing due to on that
 score? let us sit down. you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came
 here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i
 be dissuaded from it. i have not been used to submit to any person’s
 whims. i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”
 
“_that_ will make your ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;
 but it will have effect on _me_.”
 
“i will not be interrupted! hear in silence. my daughter and my
 nephew are formed for each other. they are descended, on the maternal
 side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,
 honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. their fortune on
 both sides is splendid. they are destined for each other by the voice of
 every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide
 them?--the upstart pretensions of young woman without family,
 connections, or fortune! is this to be endured? but it must not, shall
 not be! if you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to
 quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”
 
“in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that
 sphere. is gentleman; i am gentleman’s daughter; so far we are
 equal.”
 
“true. you _are_ gentleman’s daughter. but what was your mother? who
 are your uncles and aunts? do not imagine ignorant of their
 condition.”
 
“whatever my connections may be,” said elizabeth, “if your nephew does
 not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”
 
“tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”
 
though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady
 catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
 moment’s deliberation,--
 
“i am not.”
 
lady catherine seemed pleased.
 
“and will you promise never to enter into such an engagement?”
 
“i will make promise of the kind.”
 
“miss bennet, i am shocked and astonished. i expected to find more
 reasonable young woman. but do not deceive yourself into belief that i
 will ever recede. i shall not go away till you have given the
 assurance i require.”
 
“and i certainly _never_ shall give it. i am not to be intimidated into
 anything so wholly unreasonable. your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry
 your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make
 _their_ marriage at all more probable? supposing him to be attached to
 me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on
 his cousin? allow to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with
 which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
 frivolous as the application was ill-judged. you have widely mistaken my
 character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
 how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
 i cannot tell; but you have certainly right to concern yourself in
 mine. i must beg, therefore, to be importuned further on the
 subject.”
 
“not so hasty, if you please. i have by means done. to all the
 objections i have already urged i have still another to add. i am no
 stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous
 elopement. i know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a
 patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. and is
 _such_ girl to be my nephew’s sister? is _her_ husband, who is the son
 of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? heaven and earth!--of
 what are you thinking? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?”
 
“you can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.
 “you have insulted me, in every possible method. i must beg to return to
 the house.”
 
and she rose as she spoke. lady catherine rose also, and they turned
 back. her ladyship was highly incensed.
 
“you have regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
 unfeeling, selfish girl! do you not consider that connection with you
 must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”
 
“lady catherine, i have nothing further to say. you know my sentiments.”
 
“you are then resolved to have him?”
 
“i have said such thing. i am only resolved to act in that manner,
 which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
 reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”
 
“it is well. you refuse, then, to oblige me. you refuse to obey the
 claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. you are determined to ruin him in
 the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”
 
“neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied elizabeth, “has any
 possible claim on me, in the present instance. principle of either
 would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy. and with regard to the
 resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
 _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give one moment’s
 concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
 the scorn.”
 
“and this is your real opinion! this is your final resolve! very well. i
 shall now know how to act. do not imagine, miss bennet, that your
 ambition will ever be gratified. i came to try you. i hoped to find you
 reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point.”
 
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of
 the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--
 
“i take leave of you, miss bennet. i send compliments to your
 mother. you deserve such attention. i am most seriously displeased.”
 
elizabeth made answer; and without attempting to persuade her
 ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. she
 heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. her mother
 impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why lady
 catherine would not come in again and rest herself.
 
“she did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”
 
“she is very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
 civil! for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.
 she is on her road somewhere, i dare say; and so, passing through
 meryton, thought she might as well call on you. i suppose she had
 nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?”
 
elizabeth was forced to give in to little falsehood here; for to
 acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.

chapter lvii.
 

[illustration]
 
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
 elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
 hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. lady catherine, it
 appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings
 for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr.
 darcy. it was rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of
 their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at loss to imagine;
 till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley,
 and _her_ being the sister of jane, was enough, at time when the
 expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
 the idea. she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
 sister must bring them more frequently together. and her neighbours at
 lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
 collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady catherine,) had
 only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had
 looked forward to as possible at some future time.
 
in revolving lady catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help
 feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
 in this interference. from what she had said of her resolution to
 prevent the marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an
 application to her nephew; and how might take similar
 representation of the evils attached to connection with her she dared
 not pronounce. she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
 aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
 that thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
 was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of marriage with _one_
 whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
 address him on his weakest side. with his notions of dignity, would
 probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak
 and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
 
if had been wavering before, as to what should do, which had often
 seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near relation might
 settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
 unblemished could make him. in that case would return more. lady
 catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
 bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.
 
“if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
 friend within few days,” she added, “i shall know how to understand
 it. i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
 constancy. if is satisfied with only regretting me, when might
 have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him
 at all.”
 
the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
 been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same
 kind of supposition which had appeased mrs. bennet’s curiosity; and
 elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.
 
the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
 father, who came out of his library with letter in his hand.
 
“lizzy,” said he, “i was going to look for you: come into my room.”
 
she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what had to tell
 her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
 connected with the letter held. it suddenly struck her that it might
 be from lady catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the
 consequent explanations.
 
she followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. he
 then said,--
 
“i have received letter this morning that has astonished me
 exceedingly. as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
 contents. i did not know before that i had _two_ daughters on the brink
 of matrimony. let congratulate you on very important conquest.”
 
the colour now rushed into elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous
 conviction of its being letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
 and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that explained
 himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
 herself, when her father continued,--
 
“you look conscious. young ladies have great penetration in such matters
 as these; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the
 name of your admirer. this letter is from mr. collins.”
 
“from mr. collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”
 
“something very much to the purpose, of course. begins with
 congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
 which, it seems, has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
 lucases. i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what says
 on that point. what relates to yourself is as follows:--‘having thus
 offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on
 this happy event, let now add short hint on the subject of another,
 of which we have been advertised by the same authority. your daughter
 elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after
 her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate
 may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages
 in this land.’ can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?
 ‘this young gentleman is blessed, in peculiar way, with everything the
 heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and
 extensive patronage. yet, in spite of all these temptations, let warn
 my cousin elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a
 precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,
 you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ have you any idea,
 lizzy, who this gentleman is? but now it comes out. ‘my motive for
 cautioning you is as follows:--we have reason to imagine that his aunt,
 lady catherine bourgh, does not look on the match with friendly
 eye.’ _mr. darcy_, you see, is the man! now, lizzy, i think i _have_
 surprised you. could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within
 the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
 effectually to what they related? mr. darcy, who never looks at any
 woman but to see blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
 his life! it is admirable!”
 
elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force
 one most reluctant smile. never had his wit been directed in manner so
 little agreeable to her.
 
“are you not diverted?”
 
“oh, yes. pray read on.”
 
“‘after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
 night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
 felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of
 some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give
 her consent to what she termed so disgraceful match. i thought it my
 duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she
 and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
 hastily into marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ mr.
 collins, moreover, adds, ‘i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia’s sad
 business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
 living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
 known. i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
 from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
 couple into your house as soon as they were married. it was an
 encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should
 very strenuously have opposed it. you ought certainly to forgive them as
 christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
 names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _that_ is his notion of
 christian forgiveness! the rest of his letter is only about his dear
 charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of young olive-branch. but,
 lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. you are not going to be
 _missish_, i hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. for
 what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them
 in our turn?”
 
“oh,” cried elizabeth, “i am exceedingly diverted. but it is so
 strange!”
 
“yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. had they fixed on any other man
 it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_
 pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! much as i abominate
 writing, i would not give up mr. collins’s correspondence for any
 consideration. nay, when i read letter of his, i cannot help giving
 him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and
 hypocrisy of my son-in-law. and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine
 about this report? did she call to refuse her consent?”
 
to this question his daughter replied only with laugh; and as it had
 been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
 repeating it. elizabeth had never been more at loss to make her
 feelings appear what they were not. it was necessary to laugh when she
 would rather have cried. her father had most cruelly mortified her by
 what said of mr. darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but
 wonder at such want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of
 his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.

chapter lviii.
 

[illustration]
 
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
 elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do, was able to bring darcy
 with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine’s
 visit. the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs. bennet had time to
 tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
 momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed
 their all walking out. it was agreed to. mrs. bennet was not in the
 habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
 set off together. bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to
 outstrip them. they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy
 were to entertain each other. very little was said by either; kitty was
 too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a
 desperate resolution; and, perhaps, might be doing the same.
 
they walked towards the lucases’, because kitty wished to call upon
 maria; and as elizabeth saw occasion for making it general concern,
 when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. now was the
 moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was
 high, she immediately said,--
 
“mr. darcy, i am very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving
 relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours. i
 can longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
 sister. ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to
 acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it. were it known to the rest
 of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”
 
“i am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied darcy, in tone of surprise
 and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
 mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. i did not think mrs. gardiner
 was so little to be trusted.”
 
“you must not blame my aunt. lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
 that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could
 not rest till i knew the particulars. let thank you again and again,
 in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
 you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
 sake of discovering them.”
 
“if you _will_ thank me,” replied, “let it be for yourself alone.
 that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
 inducements which led on, i shall not attempt to deny. but your
 _family_ owe nothing. much as i respect them, i believe i thought
 only of _you_.”
 
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say word. after short pause,
 her companion added, “you are too generous to trifle with me. if your
 feelings are still what they were last april, tell so at once. _my_
 affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence
 on this subject for ever.”
 
elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
 his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
 very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
 so material change since the period to which alluded, as to make
 her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. the
 happiness which this reply produced was such as had probably never
 felt before; and expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
 warmly as man violently in love can be supposed to do. had elizabeth
 been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the
 expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but
 though she could not look she could listen; and told her of feelings
 which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection
 every moment more valuable.
 
they walked on without knowing in what direction. there was too much to
 be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. she
 soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
 to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
 london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the
 substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
 every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship’s apprehension,
 peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
 such relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
 her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. but, unluckily for her
 ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
 
“it taught to hope,” said he, “as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
 to hope before. i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that
 had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
 acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly.”
 
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “yes, you know enough of
 my _frankness_ to believe capable of _that_. after abusing you so
 abominably to your face, i could have scruple in abusing you to all
 your relations.”
 
“what did you say of that i did not deserve? for though your
 accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
 to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. it was
 unpardonable. i cannot think of it without abhorrence.”
 
“we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
 evening,” said elizabeth. “the conduct of neither, if strictly
 examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, i hope,
 improved in civility.”
 
“i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. the recollection of what i
 then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
 it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. your
 reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a
 more gentlemanlike manner.’ those were your words. you know not, you can
 scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, i
 confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”
 
“i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
 impression. i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
 way.”
 
“i can easily believe it. you thought then devoid of every proper
 feeling, i am sure you did. the turn of your countenance i shall never
 forget, as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
 way that would induce you to accept me.”
 
“oh, do not repeat what i then said. these recollections will not do at
 all. i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”
 
darcy mentioned his letter. “did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you
 think better of me? did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
 contents?”
 
she explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all
 her former prejudices had been removed.
 
“i knew,” said he, “that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was
 necessary. i hope you have destroyed the letter. there was one part,
 especially the opening of it, which i should dread your having the power
 of reading again. i can remember some expressions which might justly
 make you hate me.”
 
“the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
 preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
 opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily
 changed as that implies.”
 
“when i wrote that letter,” replied darcy, “i believed myself perfectly
 calm and cool; but i am since convinced that it was written in a
 dreadful bitterness of spirit.”
 
“the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. the
 adieu is charity itself. but think more of the letter. the feelings
 of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely
 different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance
 attending it ought to be forgotten. you must learn some of my
 philosophy. think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
 pleasure.”
 
“i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _your_
 retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
 arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
 ignorance. but with _me_, it is not so. painful recollections will
 intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. i have been a
 selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. as a
 child i was taught what was _right_, but i was not taught to correct my
 temper. i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
 and conceit. unfortunately an only (for many years an only _child_),
 i was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father
 particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
 almost taught to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
 my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
 _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
 my own. such i was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such i might
 still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth! what do i not
 owe you! you taught lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
 advantageous. by you, i was properly humbled. i came to you without a
 doubt of my reception. you showed how insufficient were all my
 pretensions to please woman worthy of being pleased.”
 
“had you then persuaded yourself that i should?”
 
“indeed i had. what will you think of my vanity? i believed you to be
 wishing, expecting my addresses.”
 
“my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, i assure
 you. i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
 wrong. how you must have hated after _that_ evening!”
 
“hate you! i was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to
 take proper direction.”
 
“i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of when we met at
 pemberley. you blamed for coming?”
 
“no, indeed, i felt nothing but surprise.”
 
“your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
 my conscience told that i deserved extraordinary politeness, and i
 confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”
 
“my object _then_,” replied darcy, “was to show you, by every civility
 in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped
 to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
 see that your reproofs had been attended to. how soon any other wishes
 introduced themselves, i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half
 an hour after i had seen you.”
 
then told her of georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
 disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
 the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
 following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
 before quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there
 had arisen from other struggles than what such purpose must
 comprehend.
 
she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful subject to
 each to be dwelt on farther.
 
after walking several miles in leisurely manner, and too busy to know
 anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
 it was time to be at home.
 
“what could have become of mr. bingley and jane?” was wonder which
 introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. darcy was delighted with
 their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
 it.
 
“i must ask whether you were surprised?” said elizabeth.
 
“not at all. when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen.”
 
“that is to say, you had given your permission. i guessed as much.” and
 though exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
 the case.
 
“on the evening before my going to london,” said he, “i made a
 confession to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago. i told
 him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
 affairs absurd and impertinent. his surprise was great. had never had
 the slightest suspicion. i told him, moreover, that i believed myself
 mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent
 to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
 unabated, i felt doubt of their happiness together.”
 
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
 friend.
 
“did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him
 that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”
 
“from the former. i had narrowly observed her, during the two visits
 which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection.”
 
“and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to
 him.”
 
“it did. bingley is most unaffectedly modest. his diffidence had
 prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious case, but
 his reliance on mine made everything easy. i was obliged to confess one
 thing, which for time, and not unjustly, offended him. i could not
 allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
 last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him. was
 angry. but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted longer than remained
 in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. has heartily forgiven me
 now.”
 
elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been most delightful
 friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
 herself. she remembered that had yet to learn to be laughed at, and
 it was rather too early to begin. in anticipating the happiness of
 bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
 continued the conversation till they reached the house. in the hall they
 parted.

chapter lix.
 

[illustration]
 
“my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was question
 which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and
 from all the others when they sat down to table. she had only to say in
 reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
 knowledge. she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
 else, awakened suspicion of the truth.
 
the evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. the
 acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.
 darcy was not of disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
 and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
 than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
 there were other evils before her. she anticipated what would be felt in
 the family when her situation became known: she was aware that one
 liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
 _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
 
at night she opened her heart to jane. though suspicion was very far
 from miss bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
 
“you are joking, lizzy. this cannot be! engaged to mr. darcy! no, no,
 you shall not deceive me: i know it to be impossible.”
 
“this is wretched beginning, indeed! my sole dependence was on you;
 and i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. yet, indeed, i
 am in earnest. i speak nothing but the truth. still loves me, and we
 are engaged.”
 
jane looked at her doubtingly. “oh, lizzy! it cannot be. i know how much
 you dislike him.”
 
“you know nothing of the matter. _that_ is all to be forgot. perhaps i
 did not always love him so well as i do now; but in such cases as these
 good memory is unpardonable. this is the last time i shall ever
 remember it myself.”
 
miss bennet still looked all amazement. elizabeth again, and more
 seriously, assured her of its truth.
 
“good heaven! can it be really so? yet now i must believe you,” cried
 jane. “my dear, dear lizzy, i would, i do congratulate you; but are you
 certain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
 happy with him?”
 
“there can be doubt of that. it is settled between us already that we
 are to be the happiest couple in the world. but are you pleased, jane?
 shall you like to have such brother?”
 
“very, very much. nothing could give either bingley or myself more
 delight. but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. and do you
 really love him quite well enough? oh, lizzy! do anything rather than
 marry without affection. are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
 to do?”
 
“oh, yes! you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do when i
 tell you all.”
 
“what do you mean?”
 
“why, i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley. i am
 afraid you will be angry.”
 
“my dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. i want to talk very seriously.
 let know everything that i am to know without delay. will you tell me
 how long you have loved him?”
 
“it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began;
 but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
 at pemberley.”
 
another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
 desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of
 attachment. when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing
 further to wish.
 
“now i am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. i
 always had value for him. were it for nothing but his love of you, i
 must always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley’s friend and your
 husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me. but,
 lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. how little did you
 tell of what passed at pemberley and lambton! i owe all that i know
 of it to another, not to you.”
 
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. she had been unwilling to
 mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
 her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would longer
 conceal from her his share in lydia’s marriage. all was acknowledged,
 and half the night spent in conversation.
 
“good gracious!” cried mrs. bennet, as she stood at window the next
 morning, “if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with
 our dear bingley! what can mean by being so tiresome as to be always
 coming here? i had notion but would go a-shooting, or something or
 other, and not disturb us with his company. what shall we do with him?
 lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that may not be in bingley’s
 way.”
 
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient proposal; yet
 was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
 epithet.
 
as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and
 shook hands with such warmth, as left doubt of his good information;
 and soon afterwards said aloud, “mrs. bennet, have you more lanes
 hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”
 
“i advise mr. darcy, and lizzy, and kitty,” said mrs. bennet, “to walk
 to oakham mount this morning. it is nice long walk, and mr. darcy has
 never seen the view.”
 
“it may do very well for the others,” replied mr. bingley; “but i am
 sure it will be too much for kitty. won’t it, kitty?”
 
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. darcy professed great
 curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently
 consented. as she went upstairs to get ready, mrs. bennet followed her,
 saying,--
 
“i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
 disagreeable man all to yourself; but i hope you will not mind it. it is
 all for jane’s sake, you know; and there is occasion for talking to
 him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”
 
during their walk, it was resolved that mr. bennet’s consent should be
 asked in the course of the evening: elizabeth reserved to herself the
 application for her mother’s. she could not determine how her mother
 would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
 would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she
 were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
 was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
 her sense; and she could more bear that mr. darcy should hear the
 first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
 disapprobation.
 
in the evening, soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
 mr. darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
 extreme. she did not fear her father’s opposition, but was going to
 be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,
 his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
 filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was wretched
 reflection, and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again, when,
 looking at him, she was little relieved by his smile. in few minutes
 approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while
 pretending to admire her work, said in whisper, “go to your father; he
 wants you in the library.” she was gone directly.
 
her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
 “lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? are you out of your senses to be
 accepting this man? have not you always hated him?”
 
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
 reasonable, her expressions more moderate! it would have spared her from
 explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
 but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
 of her attachment to mr. darcy.
 
“or, in other words, you are determined to have him. is rich, to be
 sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.
 but will they make you happy?”
 
“have you any other objection,” said elizabeth, “than your belief of my
 indifference?”
 
“none at all. we all know him to be proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
 this would be nothing if you really liked him.”
 
“i do, i do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “i love him.
 indeed has improper pride. is perfectly amiable. you do not
 know what really is; then pray do not pain by speaking of him in
 such terms.”
 
“lizzy,” said her father, “i have given him my consent. is the kind
 of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse anything, which he
 condescended to ask. i now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
 having him. but let advise you to think better of it. i know your
 disposition, lizzy. i know that you could be neither happy nor
 respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked
 up to him as superior. your lively talents would place you in the
 greatest danger in an unequal marriage. you could scarcely escape
 discredit and misery. my child, let not have the grief of seeing
 _you_ unable to respect your partner in life. you know not what you are
 about.”
 
elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
 and, at length, by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the
 object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
 estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
 his affection was not the work of day, but had stood the test of many
 months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,
 she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the
 match.
 
“well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “i have more to
 say. if this be the case, deserves you. i could not have parted with
 you, my lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”
 
to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr. darcy
 had voluntarily done for lydia. heard her with astonishment.
 
“this is an evening of wonders, indeed! and so, darcy did everything;
 made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him
 his commission! so much the better. it will save world of trouble
 and economy. had it been your uncle’s doing, i must and _would_ have
 paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own
 way. i shall offer to pay him to-morrow, will rant and storm about
 his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”
 
then recollected her embarrassment few days before on his reading
 mr. collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
 at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “if any young men come
 for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure.”
 
elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from very heavy weight; and, after
 half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
 the others with tolerable composure. everything was too recent for
 gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was longer
 anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
 would come in time.
 
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
 and made the important communication. its effect was most extraordinary;
 for, on first hearing it, mrs. bennet sat quite still, and unable to
 utter syllable. nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could
 comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what
 was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
 lover to any of them. she began at length to recover, to fidget about in
 her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.
 
“good gracious! lord bless me! only think! dear me! mr. darcy! who would
 have thought it? and is it really true? oh, my sweetest lizzy! how rich
 and how great you will be! what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
 you will have! jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. i am so
 pleased--so happy. such charming man! so handsome! so tall! oh, my
 dear lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. i
 hope will overlook it. dear, dear lizzy. house in town! everything
 that is charming! three daughters married! ten thousand year! oh,
 lord! what will become of me? i shall go distracted.”
 
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and
 elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
 soon went away. but before she had been three minutes in her own room,
 her mother followed her.
 
“my dearest child,” she cried, “i can think of nothing else. ten
 thousand year, and very likely more! ’tis as good as lord! and a
 special licence--you must and shall be married by special licence.
 but, my dearest love, tell what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond
 of, that i may have it to-morrow.”
 
this was sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman
 himself might be; and elizabeth found that, though in the certain
 possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’
 consent, there was still something to be wished for. but the morrow
 passed off much better than she expected; for mrs. bennet luckily stood
 in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
 to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
 her deference for his opinion.
 
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
 acquainted with him; and mr. bennet soon assured her that was rising
 every hour in his esteem.
 
“i admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “wickham, perhaps,
 is my favourite; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well
 as jane’s.”

chapter lx.
 

[illustration]
 
elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr.
 darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “how could
 you begin?” said she. “i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
 you had once made beginning; but what could set you off in the first
 place?”
 
“i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
 laid the foundation. it is too long ago. i was in the middle before i
 knew that i _had_ begun.”
 
“my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
 to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke
 to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. now, be
 sincere; did you admire for my impertinence?”
 
“for the liveliness of your mind i did.”
 
“you may as well call it impertinence at once. it was very little less.
 the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
 attention. you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
 and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. i roused and
 interested you, because i was so unlike _them_. had you not been really
 amiable you would have hated for it: but in spite of the pains you
 took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
 in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
 courted you. there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
 and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly
 reasonable. to be sure you know actual good of me--but nobody thinks
 of _that_ when they fall in love.”
 
“was there good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was
 ill at netherfield?”
 
“dearest jane! who could have done less for her? but make virtue of it
 by all means. my good qualities are under your protection, and you are
 to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
 to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
 be; and i shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling
 to come to the point at last? what made you so shy of me, when you
 first called, and afterwards dined here? why, especially, when you
 called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”
 
“because you were grave and silent, and gave encouragement.”
 
“but i was embarrassed.”
 
“and so was i.”
 
“you might have talked to more when you came to dinner.”
 
“a man who had felt less might.”
 
“how unlucky that you should have reasonable answer to give, and that
 i should be so reasonable as to admit it! but i wonder how long you
 _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. i wonder when
 you _would_ have spoken if i had not asked you! my resolution of
 thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect. _too
 much_, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
 springs from breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the
 subject? this will never do.”
 
“you need not distress yourself. the moral will be perfectly fair. lady
 catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
 removing all my doubts. i am not indebted for my present happiness to
 your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. i was not in humour to
 wait for an opening of yours. my aunt’s intelligence had given hope,
 and i was determined at once to know everything.”
 
“lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
 for she loves to be of use. but tell me, what did you come down to
 netherfield for? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?
 or had you intended any more serious consequences?”
 
“my real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if i could, whether i
 might ever hope to make you love me. my avowed one, or what i avowed to
 myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to bingley, and
 if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made.”
 
“shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to
 befall her?”
 
“i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth. but it ought to
 be done; and if you will give sheet of paper it shall be done
 directly.”
 
“and if i had not letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and
 admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. but
 i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”
 
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy
 had been overrated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner’s
 long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
 be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt
 had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
 follows:--
 
“i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done,
 for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the
 truth, i was too cross to write. you supposed more than really existed.
 but _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give loose to your fancy,
 indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
 afford, and unless you believe actually married, you cannot greatly
 err. you must write again very soon, and praise him great deal more
 than you did in your last. i thank you again and again, for not going to
 the lakes. how could i be so silly as to wish it! your idea of the
 ponies is delightful. we will go round the park every day. i am the
 happiest creature in the world. perhaps other people have said so
 before, but one with such justice. i am happier even than jane; she
 only smiles, i laugh. mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that
 can be spared from me. you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.
 yours,” etc.
 
mr. darcy’s letter to lady catherine was in different style, and still
 different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins, in return
 for his last.
 
/* “dear sir, */
 
“i must trouble you once more for congratulations. elizabeth will
 soon be the wife of mr. darcy. console lady catherine as well as
 you can. but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew. has
 more to give.
 
“yours sincerely,” etc.
 
miss bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching
 marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. she wrote even to
 jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former
 professions of regard. jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and
 though feeling reliance on her, could not help writing her much
 kinder answer than she knew was deserved.
 
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was
 as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. four sides of paper were
 insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
 being loved by her sister.
 
before any answer could arrive from mr. collins, or any congratulations
 to elizabeth from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the
 collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge. the reason of this
 sudden removal was soon evident. lady catherine had been rendered so
 exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that
 charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
 the storm was blown over. at such moment, the arrival of her friend
 was sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their
 meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
 saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
 husband. bore it, however, with admirable calmness. could even
 listen to sir william lucas, when complimented him on carrying away
 the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
 meeting frequently at st. james’s, with very decent composure. if did
 shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.
 
mrs. philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, greater tax on his
 forbearance; and though mrs. philips, as well as her sister, stood in
 too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley’s
 good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be
 vulgar. nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at
 all likely to make her more elegant. elizabeth did all she could to
 shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to
 keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom might
 converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings
 arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its
 pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward
 with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so
 little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their
 family party at pemberley.

chapter lxi.

happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got
 rid of her two most deserving daughters. with what delighted pride she
 afterwards visited mrs. bingley, and talked of mrs. darcy, may be
 guessed. i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the
 accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of
 her children produced so happy an effect as to make her sensible,
 amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,
 it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic
 felicity in so unusual form, that she still was occasionally nervous
 and invariably silly.
 
mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
 drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. delighted in
 going to pemberley, especially when was least expected.
 
mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only twelvemonth. so near
 vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
 _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. the darling wish of his
 sisters was then gratified: bought an estate in neighbouring county
 to derbyshire; and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source
 of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
 
kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
 her two elder sisters. in society so superior to what she had generally
 known, her improvement was great. she was not of so ungovernable a
 temper as lydia; and, removed from the influence of lydia’s example, she
 became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
 ignorant, and less insipid. from the further disadvantage of lydia’s
 society she was of course carefully kept; and though mrs. wickham
 frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
 balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.
 
mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
 drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet’s being quite
 unable to sit alone. mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
 she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
 longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,
 it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
 much reluctance.
 
as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered revolution from
 the marriage of her sisters. bore with philosophy the conviction that
 elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
 and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of
 everything, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be
 prevailed on to make his fortune. the congratulatory letter which
 elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by
 his wife at least, if not by himself, such hope was cherished. the
 letter was to this effect:--
 
/* “my dear lizzy, */
 
“i wish you joy. if you love mr. darcy half so well as i do my dear
 wickham, you must be very happy. it is great comfort to have you
 so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will
 think of us. i am sure wickham would like place at court very
 much; and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
 upon without some help. any place would do of about three or four
 hundred year; but, however, do not speak to mr. darcy about it,
 if you had rather not.
 
“yours,” etc.
 
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in
 her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
 such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
 of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she
 frequently sent them. it had always been evident to her that such an
 income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
 their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
 their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or
 herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards
 discharging their bills. their manner of living, even when the
 restoration of peace dismissed them to home, was unsettled in the
 extreme. they were always moving from place to place in quest of a
 cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. his affection
 for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted little longer; and,
 in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
 reputation which her marriage had given her. though darcy could never
 receive _him_ at pemberley, yet, for elizabeth’s sake, assisted him
 further in his profession. lydia was occasionally visitor there, when
 her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath; and with the
 bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even
 bingley’s good-humour was overcome, and proceeded so far as to _talk_
 of giving them hint to be gone.
 
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy’s marriage; but as she
 thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she
 dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as
 attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
 to elizabeth.
 
pemberley was now georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters
 was exactly what darcy had hoped to see. they were able to love each
 other, even as well as they intended. georgiana had the highest opinion
 in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
 astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of
 talking to her brother. he, who had always inspired in herself respect
 which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
 pleasantry. her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
 her way. by elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a
 woman may take liberties with her husband, which brother will not
 always allow in sister more than ten years younger than himself.
 
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
 and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
 her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
 language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time
 all intercourse was at an end. but at length, by elizabeth’s persuasion,
 was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek reconciliation;
 and, after little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
 resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
 to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
 them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
 received, not merely from the presence of such mistress, but the
 visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.
 
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. darcy,
 as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
 sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
 her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

_walt whitman has somewhere fine and just distinction between “loving
 by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” this distinction applies
 to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
 numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it
 brings curious consequence with it. there is much more difference as
 to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by
 allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and
 proper thing to love them. and in the sect--fairly large and yet
 unusually choice--of austenians or janites, there would probably be
 found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the
 novels. to some the delightful freshness and humour of_ northanger
 abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted
 critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
 of burlesque or parody, kind in which the first rank is reached with
 difficulty._ persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
 in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite
 delicacy and keeping. the catastrophe of_ mansfield park _is admittedly
 theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost
 wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that
 edmund only took fanny because mary shocked him, and that fanny might
 very likely have taken crawford if had been little more assiduous;
 yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of mrs. norris and
 others have secured, i believe, considerable party for it._ sense and
 sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
 not want them._
 
_i suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes
 would, all things considered, be divided between_ emma _and the present
 book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed fondness for miss
 austen be not of itself patent of exemption from any possible charge
 of vulgarity) would go for_ emma. _it is the larger, the more varied, the
 more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather
 more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most
 peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as miss bates, as the
 eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. on the other hand,
 i, for my part, declare for_ pride and prejudice _unhesitatingly. it
 seems to the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most
 eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention
 in such narrow space as is permitted to me, i propose here to show
 cause._
 
_in the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the
 reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,
 when miss austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and
 finished at chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till
 1813, only four years before her death. i do not know whether, in this
 combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the
 critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct
 superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it
 possesses over all the others. the plot, though not elaborate, is almost
 regular enough for fielding; hardly character, hardly an incident
 could be retrenched without loss to the story. the elopement of lydia
 and wickham is not, like that of crawford and mrs. rushworth, a_ coup de
 théâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the
 story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.
 all the minor passages--the loves of jane and bingley, the advent of mr.
 collins, the visit to hunsford, the derbyshire tour--fit in after the
 same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. there is attempt at the
 hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between
 frank churchill and jane fairfax contributes doubt good deal to the
 intrigue of_ emma, _but contributes it in fashion which i do not think
 the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. although miss austen
 always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her
 opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to
 be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly
 natural occasions provided by the false account of darcy’s conduct given
 by wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from
 the gradual transformation of elizabeth’s own feelings from positive
 aversion to actual love. i do not know whether the all-grasping hand of
 the playwright has ever been laid upon_ pride and prejudice; _and i dare
 say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or
 garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and
 delicate for pit and gallery. but if the attempt were made, it would
 certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,
 which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can
 avail himself, appear at once on the stage._
 
_i think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to
 more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest
 merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. it sets off his other gifts
 and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it
 will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite
 consciously--to eyes by means ultra-critical. but very badly-built
 novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which
 displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all
 faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than faultless plot
 acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. and despite the
 ability which miss austen has shown in working out the story, i for one
 should put_ pride and prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what
 seem to the very masterpieces of miss austen’s humour and of her
 faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit john
 thorpe, the eltons, mrs. norris, and one or two others to their company,
 but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still
 superior to them._
 
_the characteristics of miss austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate
 that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to
 express, and at any particular time likely to be differently
 apprehended by different persons. to this humour seems to possess a
 greater affinity, on the whole, to that of addison than to any other of
 the numerous species of this great british genus. the differences of
 scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,
 obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,
 for there was distinctly feminine element in “mr. spectator,” and in
 jane austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was
 masculine. but the likeness of quality consists in great number of
 common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,
 avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. also there is in both a
 certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. it is the custom with those
 who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of addison with the
 savagery of swift, the mildness of miss austen with the boisterousness
 of fielding and smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that
 her immediate predecessor, miss burney, allowed without very much
 protest. yet, both in mr. addison and in miss austen there is, though a
 restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in
 roasting and cutting up fool. man in the early eighteenth century,
 of course, could push this taste further than lady in the early
 nineteenth; and doubt miss austen’s principles, as well as her heart,
 would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate
 husband in the_ spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the
 innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play
 at blind-man’s-buff. but another_ spectator _letter--that of the damsel
 of fourteen who wishes to marry mr. shapely, and assures her selected
 mentor that “he admires your_ spectators _mightily”--might have been
 written by rather more ladylike and intelligent lydia bennet in the
 days of lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (i
 think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of miss austen’s
 own, such as her satire of mrs. musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over
 her son. but this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the
 english language, especially when, by glaring and gratuitous
 falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and
 snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. if cynicism means
 the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells
 beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and
 that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then
 every man and woman who is not fool, who does not care to live in a
 fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is
 cynic. and in that sense miss austen certainly was one. she may even
 have been one in the further sense that, like her own mr. bennet, she
 took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at
 work her fools and her mean persons. i think she did take this delight,
 and i do not think at all the worse of her for it as woman, while she
 was immensely the better for it as an artist._
 
_in respect of her art generally, mr. goldwin smith has truly observed
 that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,
 combined with the narrowness of her field;” and has justly added that
 we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of miniature
 painter. to make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the
 term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of memling
 at one end of the history of painting and meissonier at the other, than
 of cosway or any of his kind. and i am not so certain that i should
 myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. if her world is a
 microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the
 littleness. she does not touch what she did not feel herself called to
 paint; i am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not
 feel herself called to touch. it is at least remarkable that in two very
 short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not
 much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a
 single failure. it is possible that the romantic paste in her
 composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly
 anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century
 seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. even scott
 required hill and mountain and ballad, even coleridge metaphysics and
 german to enable them to chip the classical shell. miss austen was an
 english girl, brought up in country retirement, at the time when
 ladies went back into the house if there was white frost which might
 pierce their kid shoes, when sudden cold was the subject of the
 gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were
 subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which
 mary wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular
 taste or judgment. miss austen, too, drew back when the white frost
 touched her shoes; but i think she would have made pretty good journey
 even in black one._
 
_for if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which
 only genius knows. the one was humanity, and the other was art. on the
 first head she could not make mistake; her men, though limited, are
 true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” as to art, if she
 has never tried idealism, her realism is real to degree which makes
 the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. take almost any
 frenchman, except the late m. maupassant, and watch him laboriously
 piling up strokes in the hope of giving complete impression. you get
 none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what gives, you can
 shape real impression out of the rest. but with miss austen the
 myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.
 nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. when (to take the present book
 only) mr. collins changed his mind from jane to elizabeth “while mrs.
 bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _mrs. bennet would have
 stirred the fire), when mr. darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_
 himself,” _the touch in each case is like that of swift--“taller by the
 breadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant thackeray with
 just and outspoken admiration. indeed, fantastic as it may seem, i
 should put miss austen as near to swift in some ways, as i have put her
 to addison in others._
 
_this swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears
 nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable mr.
 collins. mr. collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything addison
 ever did, almost great enough for fielding or for swift himself. it has
 been said that one ever was like him. but in the first place,_ he
 _was like him; is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds
 of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and
 distinguished philosophers.” in the second place, it is rash, i think,
 to conclude that an actual mr. collins was impossible or non-existent at
 the end of the eighteenth century. it is very interesting that we
 possess, in this same gallery, what may be called spoiled first
 draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in john dashwood. the
 formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait
 is only half alive, and is felt to be even little unnatural. mr.
 collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. in fact, for all the
 “miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which certain
 side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century
 humanity, its philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,
 its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,
 its selfishness, receives exhibition. i will not admit that one speech
 or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled
 with reality, and i should not wonder if many of these words and actions
 are historically true._
 
_but the greatness of mr. collins could not have been so satisfactorily
 exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the
 figures of mr. bennet and of lady catherine bourgh. the latter, like
 mr. collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. there is,
 perhaps, very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me
 very faint indeed. even now i do not think that it would be impossible
 to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble
 birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,
 as lady catherine. hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the lady
 powerful (if not exactly bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,
 rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of
 developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present
 themselves now. as for mr. bennet, miss austen, and mr. darcy, and even
 miss elizabeth herself, were, i am inclined to think, rather hard on him
 for the “impropriety” of his conduct. his wife was evidently, and must
 always have been, quite irreclaimable fool; and unless had shot her
 or himself there was way out of it for man of sense and spirit but
 the ironic. from other point of view is open to any reproach,
 except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of
 the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the
 consciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that
 even miss austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. it is
 difficult to know whether is most agreeable when talking to his wife,
 or when putting mr. collins through his paces; but the general sense of
 the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his
 consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “my dear,
 do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. let us hope for better things.
 let us flatter ourselves that_ i _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry
 to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which mr. collins has just
 related as made by himself to lady catherine, “may i ask whether these
 pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the
 result of previous study?” these are the things which give miss austen’s
 readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by
 the readers of swift, of fielding, and we may here add, of thackeray, as
 they are felt by the readers of other english author of fiction
 outside of these four._
 
_the goodness of the minor characters in_ pride and prejudice _has been
 already alluded to, and it makes detailed dwelling on their beauties
 difficult in any space, and impossible in this. mrs. bennet we have
 glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely
 amusing or more horribly true. much the same may be said of kitty and
 lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have
 differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and
 vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common
 weaknesses of woman at such different ages. with mary, miss austen has
 taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;
 not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting
 traditional appendices which mr. austen leigh has given us, in dooming
 her privately to marry “one of mr. philips’s clerks.” the habits of
 first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and
 singing too long in public, are, doubt, grievous and criminal; but
 perhaps poor mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings
 in that fordyce-belectured generation. it is at any rate difficult not
 to extend to her share of the respect and affection (affection and
 respect of peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards mr.
 collins, when she draws the moral of lydia’s fall. i sometimes wish
 that the exigencies of the story had permitted miss austen to unite
 these personages, and thus at once achieve notable mating and soothe
 poor mrs. bennet’s anguish over the entail._
 
_the bingleys and the gardiners and the lucases, miss darcy and miss de
 bourgh, jane, wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,
 further than the remark that charlotte lucas (her egregious papa, though
 delightful, is just little on the thither side of the line between
 comedy and farce) is wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and
 that wickham (though something of miss austen’s hesitation of touch in
 dealing with young men appears) is not much less notable sketch in
 drab of another. only genius could have made charlotte what she is, yet
 not disagreeable; wickham what is, without investing him either with
 cheap don juanish attractiveness or disgusting rascality. but the
 hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._
 
_darcy has always seemed to by far the best and most interesting of
 miss austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being henry tilney,
 whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into
 comparison. it has sometimes, i believe, been urged that his pride is
 unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while
 his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. here again i
 cannot go with the objectors. darcy’s own account of the way in which
 his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and
 nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its
 sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of elizabeth’s
 scornful refusal acting on nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. nothing in
 even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of
 his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of pemberley. had he
 been bad prig or bad coxcomb, might have been still smarting
 under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come
 husband-hunting. his being neither is exactly consistent with the
 probable feelings of man spoilt in the common sense, but not really
 injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. as for his being in
 love, elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that
 phenomenon as darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,
 only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal
 charm._
 
_the secret of that charm many men and not few women, from miss austen
 herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is thing rather
 to be felt than to be explained. elizabeth of course belongs to the_
 allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of venus. miss austen was
 always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and
 except the fine eyes, and hint or two that she had at any rate
 sometimes bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing
 about her looks. but her chief difference from other heroines of the
 lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost
 strong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and
 secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her
 propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. elizabeth can give
 at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never
 “scratches,” and she never attacks first. some of the merest
 obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early
 speeches slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to
 serious business, as in the great proposal scene with darcy (which is,
 as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the
 final ladies’ battle with lady catherine, she is unexceptionable. then
 too she is perfectly natural girl. she does not disguise from herself
 or anybody that she resents darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with
 as personal feeling. (by the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of
 this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same
 kind, expressed doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have
 been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons
 who ought to have been worse bred than darcy.) and she lets the
 injury done to jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family
 aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._
 
_still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a
 common form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her
 playfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a
 certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.
 nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent
 darcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the
 idea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating wickham.
 elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the
 “new woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)
 women have by education and experience, perfect freedom from the idea
 that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with
 her if they can. though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”
 she has mere sensibility, nasty niceness about her. the form of
 passion common and likely to seem natural in miss austen’s day was so
 invariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of
 these qualities, that she has not made elizabeth outwardly passionate.
 but i, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have
 married darcy just as willingly without pemberley as with it, and
 anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’
 conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked
 to the della cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the della
 cruscans of this._
 
_and, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of
 charm?--it is there. there were better sense in the sad mechanic
 exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. in
 the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young
 ladies with whom it might be pleasure to fall in love; there are at
 least five with whom, as it seems to me, man of taste and spirit can
 help doing so. their names are, in chronological order, elizabeth
 bennet, diana vernon, argemone lavington, beatrix esmond, and barbara
 grant. i should have been most in love with beatrix and argemone; i
 should, i think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred diana
 and barbara. but to live with and to marry, i do not know that any one
 of the four can come into competition with elizabeth._

chapter i.]
 

it is truth universally acknowledged, that single man in possession
 of good fortune must be in want of wife.
 
however little known the feelings or views of such man may be on his
 first entering neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
 of the surrounding families, that is considered as the rightful
 property of some one or other of their daughters.
 
“my dear mr. bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
 netherfield park is let at last?”
 
mr. bennet replied that had not.
 
“but it is,” returned she; “for mrs. long has just been here, and she
 told all about it.”
 
mr. bennet made answer.
 
“do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.
 
“_you_ want to tell me, and i have objection to hearing it.”
 
[illustration:
 
“he came down to see the place”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
this was invitation enough.
 
“why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is taken
 by young man of large fortune from the north of england; that came
 down on monday in chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
 delighted with it that agreed with mr. morris immediately; that is
 to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
 in the house by the end of next week.”
 
“what is his name?”
 
“bingley.”
 
“is married or single?”
 
“oh, single, my dear, to be sure! single man of large fortune; four or
 five thousand year. what fine thing for our girls!”
 
“how so? how can it affect them?”
 
“my dear mr. bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? you
 must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them.”
 
“is that his design in settling here?”
 
“design? nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he
 _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
 soon as comes.”
 
“i see occasion for that. you and the girls may go--or you may send
 them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are
 as handsome as any of them, mr. bingley might like you the best of the
 party.”
 
“my dear, you flatter me. i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
 i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. when woman has five
 grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”
 
“in such cases, woman has not often much beauty to think of.”
 
“but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when comes into
 the neighbourhood.”
 
“it is more than i engage for, i assure you.”
 
“but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it would
 be for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are determined to go,
 merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit new
 comers. indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
 him, if you do not.”
 
“you are over scrupulous, surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be very
 glad to see you; and i will send few lines by you to assure him of my
 hearty consent to his marrying whichever chooses of the girls--though
 i must throw in good word for my little lizzy.”
 
“i desire you will do such thing. lizzy is not bit better than the
 others: and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so
 good-humoured as lydia. but you are always giving _her_ the preference.”
 
“they have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are
 all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of
 quickness than her sisters.”
 
“mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such way? you take
 delight in vexing me. you have compassion on my poor nerves.”
 
“you mistake me, my dear. i have high respect for your nerves. they
 are my old friends. i have heard you mention them with consideration
 these twenty years at least.”
 
“ah, you do not know what i suffer.”
 
“but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
 thousand year come into the neighbourhood.”
 
“it will be use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
 visit them.”
 
“depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them
 all.”
 
mr. bennet was so odd mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
 reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
 been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _her_ mind
 was less difficult to develope. she was woman of mean understanding,
 little information, and uncertain temper. when she was discontented, she
 fancied herself nervous. the business of her life was to get her
 daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.

chapter ii.
 

[illustration]
 
mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley. he
 had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
 wife that should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
 paid she had knowledge of it. it was then disclosed in the following
 manner. observing his second daughter employed in trimming hat, he
 suddenly addressed her with,--
 
“i hope mr. bingley will like it, lizzy.”
 
“we are not in way to know _what_ mr. bingley likes,” said her mother,
 resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”
 
“but you forget, mamma,” said elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
 assemblies, and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him.”
 
“i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing. she has two nieces
 of her own. she is selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have opinion
 of her.”
 
“no more have i,” said mr. bennet; “and i am glad to find that you do
 not depend on her serving you.”
 
mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain
 herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
 
“don’t keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven’s sake! have little
 compassion on my nerves. you tear them to pieces.”
 
“kitty has discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
 them ill.”
 
“i do not cough for my own amusement,” replied kitty, fretfully. “when
 is your next ball to be, lizzy?”
 
“to-morrow fortnight.”
 
“ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and mrs. long does not come back till
 the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for
 she will not know him herself.”
 
“then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
 mr. bingley to _her_.”
 
“impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him
 myself; how can you be so teasing?”
 
“i honour your circumspection. fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly
 very little. one cannot know what man really is by the end of a
 fortnight. but if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
 all, mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,
 as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i
 will take it on myself.”
 
the girls stared at their father. mrs. bennet said only, “nonsense,
 nonsense!”
 
“what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “do
 you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
 them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you _there_. what say you,
 mary? for you are young lady of deep reflection, i know, and read
 great books, and make extracts.”
 
mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.
 
“while mary is adjusting her ideas,” continued, “let us return to mr.
 bingley.”
 
“i am sick of mr. bingley,” cried his wife.
 
“i am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell so before? if i
 had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on
 him. it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we
 cannot escape the acquaintance now.”
 
the astonishment of the ladies was just what wished--that of mrs.
 bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
 was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
 while.
 
“how good it was in you, my dear mr. bennet! but i knew i should
 persuade you at last. i was sure you loved your girls too well to
 neglect such an acquaintance. well, how pleased i am! and it is such a
 good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a
 word about it till now.”
 
“now, kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said mr. bennet; and,
 as spoke, left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
 
“what an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was
 shut. “i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
 or either, for that matter. at our time of life, it is not so
 pleasant, i can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
 for your sakes we would do anything. lydia, my love, though you _are_
 the youngest, i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next
 ball.”
 
“oh,” said lydia, stoutly, “i am not afraid; for though i _am_ the
 youngest, i’m the tallest.”
 
the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon would
 return mr. bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
 dinner.

chapter iii.

not all that mrs. bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
 daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
 husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley. they attacked him
 in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
 distant surmises; but eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
 last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
 lady lucas. her report was highly favourable. sir william had been
 delighted with him. was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
 agreeable, and, to crown the whole, meant to be at the next assembly
 with large party. nothing could be more delightful! to be fond of
 dancing was certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
 hopes of mr. bingley’s heart were entertained.
 
“if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield,”
 said mrs. bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
 married, i shall have nothing to wish for.”
 
in few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet’s visit, and sat about ten
 minutes with him in his library. had entertained hopes of being
 admitted to sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty had heard
 much; but saw only the father. the ladies were somewhat more
 fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper
 window, that wore blue coat and rode black horse.
 
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had
 mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
 housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. mr. bingley
 was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
 accept the honour of their invitation, etc. mrs. bennet was quite
 disconcerted. she could not imagine what business could have in town
 so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
 might always be flying about from one place to another, and never
 settled at netherfield as ought to be. lady lucas quieted her fears a
 little by starting the idea of his
 
[illustration:
 
“when the party entered”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
being gone to london only to get large party for the ball; and a
 report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and
 seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. the girls grieved over such a
 number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing
 that, instead of twelve, had brought only six with him from london,
 his five sisters and cousin. and when the party entered the
 assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: mr. bingley, his
 two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.
 
mr. bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: had pleasant
 countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. his sisters were fine women,
 with an air of decided fashion. his brother-in-law, mr. hurst, merely
 looked the gentleman; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention
 of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
 the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after
 his entrance, of his having ten thousand year. the gentlemen
 pronounced him to be fine figure of man, the ladies declared was
 much handsomer than mr. bingley, and was looked at with great
 admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave disgust
 which turned the tide of his popularity; for was discovered to be
 proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
 large estate in derbyshire could save him from having most forbidding,
 disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his
 friend.
 
mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
 people in the room: was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
 was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
 himself at netherfield. such amiable qualities must speak for
 themselves. what contrast between him and his friend! mr. darcy danced
 only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being
 introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
 walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
 his character was decided. was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
 the world, and everybody hoped that would never come there again.
 amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet, whose dislike of
 his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
 having slighted one of her daughters.
 
elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
 down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr. darcy had been
 standing near enough for her to overhear conversation between him and
 mr. bingley, who came from the dance for few minutes to press his
 friend to join it.
 
“come, darcy,” said he, “i must have you dance. i hate to see you
 standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. you had much better
 dance.”
 
“i certainly shall not. you know how i detest it, unless i am
 particularly acquainted with my partner. at such an assembly as this, it
 would be insupportable. your sisters are engaged, and there is not
 another woman in the room whom it would not be punishment to to
 stand up with.”
 
“i would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried bingley, “for a
 kingdom! upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my
 life as i have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,
 uncommonly pretty.”
 
“_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said mr.
 darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.
 
“oh, she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one
 of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i
 dare say very agreeable. do let ask my partner to introduce you.”
 
[illustration:
 
“she is tolerable”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“which do you mean?” and turning round, looked for moment at
 elizabeth, till, catching her eye, withdrew his own, and coldly said,
 “she is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and i am in no
 humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
 by other men. you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
 smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”
 
mr. bingley followed his advice. mr. darcy walked off; and elizabeth
 remained with very cordial feelings towards him. she told the story,
 however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had lively,
 playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
 
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. mrs.
 bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
 party. mr. bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
 distinguished by his sisters. jane was as much gratified by this as her
 mother could be, though in quieter way. elizabeth felt jane’s
 pleasure. mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
 accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been
 fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
 had yet learnt to care for at ball. they returned, therefore, in good
 spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
 were the principal inhabitants. they found mr. bennet still up. with a
 book, was regardless of time; and on the present occasion had a
 good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
 such splendid expectations. had rather hoped that all his wife’s
 views on the stranger would be disappointed; but soon found that he
 had very different story to hear.
 
“oh, my dear mr. bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had most
 delightful evening, most excellent ball. i wish you had been there.
 jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. everybody said how well
 she looked; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
 her twice. only think of _that_, my dear: actually danced with her
 twice; and she was the only creature in the room that asked second
 time. first of all, asked miss lucas. i was so vexed to see him stand
 up with her; but, however, did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
 can, you know; and seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
 down the dance. so inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
 asked her for the two next. then, the two third danced with miss
 king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane
 again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the _boulanger_----”
 
“if had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,
 “he would not have danced half so much! for god’s sake, say more of
 his partners. that had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”
 
“oh, my dear,” continued mrs. bennet, “i am quite delighted with him. he
 is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. i never
 in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. i dare say the
 lace upon mrs. hurst’s gown----”
 
here she was interrupted again. mr. bennet protested against any
 description of finery. she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
 of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some
 exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy.
 
“but i can assure you,” she added, “that lizzy does not lose much by not
 suiting _his_ fancy; for is most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
 all worth pleasing. so high and so conceited, that there was enduring
 him! walked here, and walked there, fancying himself so very
 great! not handsome enough to dance with! i wish you had been there, my
 dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. i quite detest the man.”

chapter iv.
 

[illustration]
 
when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
 her praise of mr. bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
 she admired him.
 
“he is just what young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
 good-humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners! so much ease,
 with such perfect good breeding!”
 
“he is also handsome,” replied elizabeth, “which young man ought
 likewise to be if possibly can. his character is thereby complete.”
 
“i was very much flattered by his asking to dance second time. i
 did not expect such compliment.”
 
“did not you? _i_ did for you. but that is one great difference between
 us. compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. what
 could be more natural than his asking you again? could not help
 seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
 the room. thanks to his gallantry for that. well, certainly is
 very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him. you have liked many a
 stupider person.”
 
“dear lizzy!”
 
“oh, you are great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
 you never see fault in anybody. all the world are good and agreeable
 in your eyes. i never heard you speak ill of human being in my life.”
 
“i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but i always speak
 what i think.”
 
“i know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. with _your_
 good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
 others! affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it
 everywhere. but to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the
 good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing
 of the bad,--belongs to you alone. and so, you like this man’s sisters,
 too, do you? their manners are not equal to his.”
 
“certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you
 converse with them. miss bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
 his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find very charming
 neighbour in her.”
 
elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at
 the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
 quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
 with judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was
 very little disposed to approve them. they were, in fact, very fine
 ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the
 power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.
 they were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private
 seminaries in town; had fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the
 habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
 of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of
 themselves and meanly of others. they were of respectable family in
 the north of england; circumstance more deeply impressed on their
 memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been
 acquired by trade.
 
mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly hundred
 thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
 but did not live to do it. mr. bingley intended it likewise, and
 sometimes made choice of his county; but, as was now provided with a
 good house and the liberty of manor, it was doubtful to many of those
 who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether might not spend the
 remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to
 purchase.
 
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
 though was now established only as tenant, miss bingley was by no
 means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was mrs. hurst, who had
 married man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
 his house as her home when it suited her. mr. bingley had not been of
 age two years when was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to
 look at netherfield house. did look at it, and into it, for half an
 hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
 with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.
 
between him and darcy there was very steady friendship, in spite of a
 great opposition of character. bingley was endeared to darcy by the
 easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though disposition
 could offer greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
 never appeared dissatisfied. on the strength of darcy’s regard, bingley
 had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. in
 understanding, darcy was the superior. bingley was by means
 deficient; but darcy was clever. was at the same time haughty,
 reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not
 inviting. in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. bingley
 was sure of being liked wherever appeared; darcy was continually
 giving offence.
 
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
 characteristic. bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
 girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;
 there had been formality, stiffness; had soon felt acquainted
 with all the room; and as to miss bennet, could not conceive an angel
 more beautiful. darcy, on the contrary, had seen collection of people
 in whom there was little beauty and fashion, for none of whom had
 felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
 pleasure. miss bennet acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too
 much.
 
mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired
 her and liked her, and pronounced her to be sweet girl, and one whom
 they should not object to know more of. miss bennet was therefore
 established as sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such
 commendation to think of her as chose.

chapter v.
 

[illustration]
 
within short walk of longbourn lived family with whom the bennets
 were particularly intimate. sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
 in meryton, where had made tolerable fortune, and risen to the
 honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. the
 distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. it had given him a
 disgust to his business and to his residence in small market town;
 and, quitting them both, had removed with his family to house about
 mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge; where he
 could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by
 business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. for,
 though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
 contrary, was all attention to everybody. by nature inoffensive,
 friendly, and obliging, his presentation at st. james’s had made him
 courteous.
 
lady lucas was very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
 valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet. they had several children. the eldest
 of them, sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
 elizabeth’s intimate friend.
 
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a
 ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
 brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.
 
“_you_ began the evening well, charlotte,” said mrs. bennet, with civil
 self-command, to miss lucas. “_you_ were mr. bingley’s first choice.”
 
“yes; but seemed to like his second better.”
 
“oh, you mean jane, i suppose, because danced with her twice. to be
 sure that _did_ seem as if admired her--indeed, i rather believe he
 _did_--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something
 about mr. robinson.”
 
“perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson: did not
 i mention it to you? mr. robinson’s asking him how liked our meryton
 assemblies, and whether did not think there were great many pretty
 women in the room, and _which_ thought the prettiest? and his
 answering immediately to the last question, ‘oh, the eldest miss bennet,
 beyond doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”
 
“upon my word! well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as
 if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”
 
“_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, eliza,” said
 charlotte. “mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
 is he? poor eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”
 
“i beg you will not put it into lizzy’s head to be vexed by his
 ill-treatment, for is such disagreeable man that it would be quite
 misfortune to be liked by him. mrs. long told last night that he
 sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”
 
[illustration: “without once opening his lips”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“are you quite sure, ma’am? is not there little mistake?” said jane.
 “i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her.”
 
“ay, because she asked him at last how liked netherfield, and he
 could not help answering her; but she said seemed very angry at being
 spoke to.”
 
“miss bingley told me,” said jane, “that never speaks much unless
 among his intimate acquaintance. with _them_ is remarkably
 agreeable.”
 
“i do not believe word of it, my dear. if had been so very
 agreeable, would have talked to mrs. long. but i can guess how it
 was; everybody says that is eat up with pride, and i dare say had
 heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep carriage, and had to come
 to the ball in hack chaise.”
 
“i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long,” said miss lucas, “but i
 wish had danced with eliza.”
 
“another time, lizzy,” said her mother, “i would not dance with _him_,
 if i were you.”
 
“i believe, ma’am, i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”
 
“his pride,” said miss lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride
 often does, because there is an excuse for it. one cannot wonder that so
 very fine young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
 should think highly of himself. if i may so express it, has _right_
 to be proud.”
 
“that is very true,” replied elizabeth, “and i could easily forgive
 _his_ pride, if had not mortified _mine_.”
 
“pride,” observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
 reflections, “is very common failing, i believe. by all that i have
 ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
 nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
 who do not cherish feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
 quality or other, real or imaginary. vanity and pride are different
 things, though the words are often used synonymously. person may be
 proud without being vain. pride relates more to our opinion of
 ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”
 
“if i were as rich as mr. darcy,” cried young lucas, who came with his
 sisters, “i should not care how proud i was. i would keep pack of
 foxhounds, and drink bottle of wine every day.”
 
“then you would drink great deal more than you ought,” said mrs.
 bennet; “and if i were to see you at it, i should take away your bottle
 directly.”
 
the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
 would; and the argument ended only with the visit.

chapter vi.

the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. the visit
 was returned in due form. miss bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the
 good-will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was
 found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
 wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the
 two eldest. by jane this attention was received with the greatest
 pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
 everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
 though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had value, as arising,
 in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. it
 was generally evident, whenever they met, that _did_ admire her; and
 to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
 which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
 way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
 was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane
 united with great strength of feeling, composure of temper and an
 uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
 suspicions of the impertinent. she mentioned this to her friend, miss
 lucas.
 
“it may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied charlotte, “to be able to impose
 on the public in such case; but it is sometimes disadvantage to be
 so very guarded. if woman conceals her affection with the same skill
 from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
 it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
 dark. there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
 attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. we can all
 _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
 very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
 encouragement. in nine cases out of ten, woman had better show _more_
 affection than she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
 may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”
 
“but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. if _i_ can
 perceive her regard for him, must be simpleton indeed not to
 discover it too.”
 
“remember, eliza, that does not know jane’s disposition as you do.”
 
“but if woman is partial to man, and does not endeavor to conceal
 it, must find it out.”
 
“perhaps must, if sees enough of her. but though bingley and jane
 meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
 always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
 every moment should be employed in conversing together. jane should
 therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
 attention. when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
 in love as much as she chooses.”
 
“your plan is good one,” replied elizabeth, “where nothing is in
 question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined
 to get rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it. but
 these are not jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. as yet she
 cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
 reasonableness. she has known him only fortnight. she danced four
 dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
 and has since dined in company with him four times. this is not quite
 enough to make her understand his character.”
 
“not as you represent it. had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
 only have discovered whether had good appetite; but you must
 remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
 evenings may do great deal.”
 
“yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
 like vingt-un better than commerce, but with respect to any other
 leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”
 
“well,” said charlotte, “i wish jane success with all my heart; and if
 she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a
 chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
 twelvemonth. happiness in marriage is entirely matter of chance. if
 the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
 ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
 least. they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
 have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
 possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
 life.”
 
“you make laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound. you know it is not
 sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”
 
occupied in observing mr. bingley’s attention to her sister, elizabeth
 was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
 interest in the eyes of his friend. mr. darcy had at first scarcely
 allowed her to be pretty: had looked at her without admiration at the
 ball; and when they next met, looked at her only to criticise. but no
 sooner had made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
 hardly good feature in her face, than began to find it was rendered
 uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. to
 this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. though had
 detected with critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
 in her form, was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
 pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
 of the fashionable world, was caught by their easy playfulness. of
 this she was perfectly unaware: to her was only the man who made
 himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
 to dance with.
 
began to wish to know more of her; and, as step towards conversing
 with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. his doing so
 drew her notice. it was at sir william lucas’s, where large party were
 assembled.
 
“what does mr. darcy mean,” said she to charlotte, “by listening to my
 conversation with colonel forster?”
 
“that is question which mr. darcy only can answer.”
 
“but if does it any more, i shall certainly let him know that i see
 what is about. has very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by
 being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him.”
 
[illustration: “the entreaties of several” [_copyright 1894 by george
 allen._]]
 
on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
 any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
 subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she
 turned to him and said,--
 
“did not you think, mr. darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well
 just now, when i was teasing colonel forster to give us ball at
 meryton?”
 
“with great energy; but it is subject which always makes lady
 energetic.”
 
“you are severe on us.”
 
“it will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said miss lucas. “i am going
 to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows.”
 
“you are very strange creature by way of friend!--always wanting me
 to play and sing before anybody and everybody! if my vanity had taken a
 musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, i would
 really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
 hearing the very best performers.” on miss lucas’s persevering, however,
 she added, “very well; if it must be so, it must.” and gravely glancing
 at mr. darcy, “there is very fine old saying, which everybody here is
 of course familiar with--‘keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and
 i shall keep mine to swell my song.”
 
her performance was pleasing, though by means capital. after song
 or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
 would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
 sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
 the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
 impatient for display.
 
mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
 application, it had given her likewise pedantic air and conceited
 manner, which would have injured higher degree of excellence than she
 had reached. elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
 much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the
 end of long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
 scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
 some of the lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
 dancing at one end of the room.
 
mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such mode of
 passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
 much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas
 was his neighbour, till sir william thus began:--
 
“what charming amusement for young people this is, mr. darcy! there is
 nothing like dancing, after all. i consider it as one of the first
 refinements of polished societies.”
 
“certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
 the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”
 
sir william only smiled. “your friend performs delightfully,” he
 continued, after pause, on seeing bingley join the group; “and i doubt
 not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr. darcy.”
 
“you saw dance at meryton, i believe, sir.”
 
“yes, indeed, and received inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. do
 you often dance at st. james’s?”
 
“never, sir.”
 
“do you not think it would be proper compliment to the place?”
 
“it is compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it.”
 
“you have house in town, i conclude?”
 
mr. darcy bowed.
 
“i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for i am fond of
 superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
 london would agree with lady lucas.”
 
paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to
 make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, was
 struck with the notion of doing very gallant thing, and called out to
 her,--
 
“my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing? mr. darcy, you must allow
 to present this young lady to you as very desirable partner. you
 cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”
 and, taking her hand, would have given it to mr. darcy, who, though
 extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
 drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william,--
 
“indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing. i entreat you
 not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for partner.”
 
mr. darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
 her hand, but in vain. elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at
 all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
 
“you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
 the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
 amusement in general, can have objection, i am sure, to oblige us
 for one half hour.”
 
“mr. darcy is all politeness,” said elizabeth, smiling.
 
“he is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we
 cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
 partner?”
 
elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. her resistance had not injured
 her with the gentleman, and was thinking of her with some
 complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley,--
 
“i can guess the subject of your reverie.”
 
“i should imagine not.”
 
“you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
 evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, i am quite of
 your opinion. i was never more annoyed! the insipidity, and yet the
 noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these
 people! what would i give to hear your strictures on them!”
 
“your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you. my mind was more
 agreeably engaged. i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
 which pair of fine eyes in the face of pretty woman can bestow.”
 
miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
 would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
 mr. darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--
 
“miss elizabeth bennet.”
 
“miss elizabeth bennet!” repeated miss bingley. “i am all astonishment.
 how long has she been such favourite? and pray when am i to wish you
 joy?”
 
“that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask. lady’s
 imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
 to matrimony, in moment. i knew you would be wishing joy.”
 
“nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as
 absolutely settled. you will have charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
 of course she will be always at pemberley with you.”
 
listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
 entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
 that all was safe, her wit flowed along.

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 



chapter vii.
 

[illustration]
 
mr. bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
 thousand year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
 in default of heirs male, on distant relation; and their mother’s
 fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
 the deficiency of his. her father had been an attorney in meryton, and
 had left her four thousand pounds.
 
she had sister married to mr. philips, who had been clerk to their
 father and succeeded him in the business, and brother settled in
 london in respectable line of trade.
 
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; most
 convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
 thither three or four times week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and
 to milliner’s shop just over the way. the two youngest of the family,
 catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:
 their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing
 better offered, walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
 hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of
 news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn
 some from their aunt. at present, indeed, they were well supplied both
 with news and happiness by the recent arrival of militia regiment in
 the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was
 the head-quarters.
 
their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting
 intelligence. every day added something to their knowledge of the
 officers’ names and connections. their lodgings were not long secret,
 and at length they began to know the officers themselves. mr. philips
 visited them all, and this opened to his nieces source of felicity
 unknown before. they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr.
 bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
 mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
 an ensign.
 
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr.
 bennet coolly observed,--
 
“from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
 of the silliest girls in the country. i have suspected it some time, but
 i am now convinced.”
 
catherine was disconcerted, and made answer; but lydia, with perfect
 indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and
 her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as was going the
 next morning to london.
 
“i am astonished, my dear,” said mrs. bennet, “that you should be so
 ready to think your own children silly. if i wished to think slightingly
 of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”
 
“if my children are silly, i must hope to be always sensible of it.”
 
“yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”
 
“this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree. i
 had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must
 so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
 foolish.”
 
“my dear mr. bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
 their father and mother. when they get to our age, i dare say they will
 not think about officers any more than we do. i remember the time when i
 liked red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so i do still at my
 heart; and if smart young colonel, with five or six thousand year,
 should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought
 colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william’s in
 his regimentals.”
 
“mamma,” cried lydia, “my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
 carter do not go so often to miss watson’s as they did when they first
 came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke’s library.”
 
mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
 note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited
 for an answer. mrs. bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
 eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--
 
“well, jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does say? well,
 jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”
 
“it is from miss bingley,” said jane, and then read it aloud.
 
/* nind “my dear friend, */
 
“if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and
 me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
 lives; for whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never
 end without quarrel. come as soon as you can on the receipt of
 this. my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
 yours ever,
 
“caroline bingley.”
 
“with the officers!” cried lydia: “i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
 _that_.”
 
“dining out,” said mrs. bennet; “that is very unlucky.”
 
“can i have the carriage?” said jane.
 
“no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
 rain; and then you must stay all night.”
 
“that would be good scheme,” said elizabeth, “if you were sure that
 they would not offer to send her home.”
 
“oh, but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley’s chaise to go to meryton;
 and the hursts have horses to theirs.”
 
“i had much rather go in the coach.”
 
“but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure. they are
 wanted in the farm, mr. bennet, are not they?”
 
[illustration: cheerful prognostics]
 
“they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them.”
 
“but if you have got them to-day,” said elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose
 will be answered.”
 
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
 were engaged; jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
 mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of bad
 day. her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it
 rained hard. her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
 delighted. the rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
 jane certainly could not come back.
 
“this was lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said mrs. bennet, more than
 once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. till the next
 morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
 contrivance. breakfast was scarcely over when servant from netherfield
 brought the following note for elizabeth:--
 
/* nind “my dearest lizzie, */
 
“i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be
 imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. my kind friends will
 not hear of my returning home till i am better. they insist also on
 my seeing mr. jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
 of his having been to me--and, excepting sore throat and a
 headache, there is not much the matter with me.
 
“yours, etc.”
 
“well, my dear,” said mr. bennet, when elizabeth had read the note
 aloud, “if your daughter should have dangerous fit of illness--if she
 should die--it would be comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
 mr. bingley, and under your orders.”
 
“oh, i am not at all afraid of her dying. people do not die of little
 trifling colds. she will be taken good care of. as long as she stays
 there, it is all very well. i would go and see her if i could have the
 carriage.”
 
elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the
 carriage was not to be had: and as she was horsewoman, walking was
 her only alternative. she declared her resolution.
 
“how can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
 thing, in all this dirt! you will not be fit to be seen when you get
 there.”
 
“i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want.”
 
“is this hint to me, lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
 horses?”
 
“no, indeed. i do not wish to avoid the walk. the distance is nothing,
 when one has motive; only three miles. i shall be back by dinner.”
 
“i admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed mary, “but every
 impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
 exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”
 
“we will go as far as meryton with you,” said catherine and lydia.
 elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
 together.
 
“if we make haste,” said lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
 see something of captain carter, before goes.”
 
in meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
 of the officers’ wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
 field after field at quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
 over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
 within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and face
 glowing with the warmth of exercise.
 
she was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but jane were
 assembled, and where her appearance created great deal of surprise.
 that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
 dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and
 miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
 for it. she was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
 brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was
 good-humour and kindness. mr. darcy said very little, and mr. hurst
 nothing at all. the former was divided between admiration of the
 brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to
 the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. the latter was
 thinking only of his breakfast.
 
her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. miss
 bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
 enough to leave her room. elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
 immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
 alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
 for such visit, was delighted at her entrance. she was not equal,
 however, to much conversation; and when miss bingley left them together,
 could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
 extraordinary kindness she was treated with. elizabeth silently attended
 her.
 
when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth
 began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
 solicitude they showed for jane. the apothecary came; and having
 examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
 violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
 advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. the advice
 was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
 ached acutely. elizabeth did not quit her room for moment, nor were
 the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
 nothing to do elsewhere.
 
when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
 unwillingly said so. miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
 wanted little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern
 at parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
 of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the
 present. elizabeth most thankfully consented, and servant was
 despatched to longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
 back supply of clothes.

chapter viii.
 

[illustration]
 
at five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
 elizabeth was summoned to dinner. to the civil inquiries which then
 poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
 much superior solicitude of mr. bingley, she could not make very
 favourable answer. jane was by means better. the sisters, on hearing
 this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
 shocking it was to have bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
 being ill themselves; and then thought more of the matter: and their
 indifference towards jane, when not immediately before them, restored
 elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.
 
their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
 regard with any complacency. his anxiety for jane was evident, and his
 attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling
 herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
 others. she had very little notice from any but him. miss bingley was
 engrossed by mr. darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr.
 hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, was an indolent man, who lived only to
 eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when found her prefer plain
 dish to ragout, had nothing to say to her.
 
when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley
 began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. her manners were
 pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:
 she had conversation, style, taste, beauty. mrs. hurst
 thought the same, and added,--
 
“she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
 walker. i shall never forget her appearance this morning. she really
 looked almost wild.”
 
“she did indeed, louisa. i could hardly keep my countenance. very
 nonsensical to come at all! why must _she_ be scampering about the
 country, because her sister had cold? her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”
 
“yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
 in mud, i am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to
 hide it not doing its office.”
 
“your picture may be very exact, louisa,” said bingley; “but this was
 all lost upon me. i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well
 when she came into the room this morning. her dirty petticoat quite
 escaped my notice.”
 
“_you_ observed it, mr. darcy, i am sure,” said miss bingley; “and i am
 inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
 an exhibition.”
 
“certainly not.”
 
“to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
 above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
 it? it seems to to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
 most country-town indifference to decorum.”
 
“it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
 bingley.
 
“i am afraid, mr. darcy,” observed miss bingley, in half whisper,
 “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
 eyes.”
 
“not at all,” replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” a
 short pause followed this speech, and mrs. hurst began again,--
 
“i have an excessive regard for jane bennet,--she is really very sweet
 girl,--and i wish with all my heart she were well settled. but with such
 father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no
 chance of it.”
 
“i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
 meryton?”
 
“yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside.”
 
“that is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.
 
“if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside,” cried bingley, “it
 would not make them one jot less agreeable.”
 
“but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
 consideration in the world,” replied darcy.
 
to this speech bingley made answer; but his sisters gave it their
 hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
 their dear friend’s vulgar relations.
 
with renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
 leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
 she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
 late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
 when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
 down stairs herself. on entering the drawing-room, she found the whole
 party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
 them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the
 excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay
 below, with book. mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment.
 
“do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”
 
“miss eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, “despises cards. she is great
 reader, and has pleasure in anything else.”
 
“i deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried elizabeth; “i
 am _not_ great reader, and i have pleasure in many things.”
 
“in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure,” said bingley; “and
 i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”
 
elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards table
 where few books were lying. immediately offered to fetch her
 others; all that his library afforded.
 
“and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
 credit; but i am an idle fellow; and though i have not many, i have more
 than i ever looked into.”
 
elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
 in the room.
 
“i am astonished,” said miss bingley, “that my father should have left
 so small collection of books. what delightful library you have at
 pemberley, mr. darcy!”
 
“it ought to be good,” replied: “it has been the work of many
 generations.”
 
“and then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying
 books.”
 
“i cannot comprehend the neglect of family library in such days as
 these.”
 
“neglect! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
 that noble place. charles, when you build _your_ house, i wish it may be
 half as delightful as pemberley.”
 
“i wish it may.”
 
“but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
 neighbourhood, and take pemberley for kind of model. there is not a
 finer county in england than derbyshire.”
 
“with all my heart: i will buy pemberley itself, if darcy will sell it.”
 
“i am talking of possibilities, charles.”
 
“upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get
 pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”
 
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
 attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
 the card-table, and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest
 sister, to observe the game.
 
“is miss darcy much grown since the spring?” said miss bingley: “will
 she be as tall as i am?”
 
“i think she will. she is now about miss elizabeth bennet’s height, or
 rather taller.”
 
“how i long to see her again! i never met with anybody who delighted me
 so much. such countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished
 for her age! her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”
 
“it is amazing to me,” said bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
 to be so very accomplished as they all are.”
 
“all young ladies accomplished! my dear charles, what do you mean?”
 
“yes, all of them, i think. they all paint tables, cover screens, and
 net purses. i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and i am
 sure i never heard young lady spoken of for the first time, without
 being informed that she was very accomplished.”
 
“your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said darcy, “has
 too much truth. the word is applied to many woman who deserves it no
 otherwise than by netting purse or covering screen; but i am very
 far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. i
 cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my
 acquaintance that are really accomplished.”
 
“nor i, i am sure,” said miss bingley.
 
“then,” observed elizabeth, “you must comprehend great deal in your
 idea of an accomplished woman.”
 
“yes; i do comprehend great deal in it.”
 
“oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
 esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
 with. woman must have thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
 dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all
 this, she must possess certain something in her air and manner of
 walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
 will be but half deserved.”
 
“all this she must possess,” added darcy; “and to all she must yet add
 something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive
 reading.”
 
“i am longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
 i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”
 
“are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
 this?”
 
“_i_ never saw such woman. _i_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
 application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”
 
mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
 implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
 answered this description, when mr. hurst called them to order, with
 bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. as all
 conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the
 room.
 
“eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is
 one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
 sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i daresay, it
 succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is paltry device, very mean art.”
 
“undoubtedly,” replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
 “there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
 to employ for captivation. whatever bears affinity to cunning is
 despicable.”
 
miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
 continue the subject.
 
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
 that she could not leave her. bingley urged mr. jones’s being sent for
 immediately; while his sisters, convinced that country advice could
 be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
 eminent physicians. this she would not hear of; but she was not so
 unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled
 that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet
 were not decidedly better. bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
 declared that they were miserable. they solaced their wretchedness,
 however, by duets after supper; while could find better relief to
 his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
 possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.

chapter ix.

elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the
 morning had the pleasure of being able to send tolerable answer to the
 inquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by housemaid,
 and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
 sisters. in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
 note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her
 own judgment of her situation. the note was immediately despatched, and
 its contents as quickly complied with. mrs. bennet, accompanied by her
 two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
 
had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs. bennet would have been
 very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
 not alarming, she had wish of her recovering immediately, as her
 restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. she
 would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried
 home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
 it at all advisable. after sitting little while with jane, on miss
 bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
 attended her into the breakfast parlour. bingley met them with hopes
 that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.
 
“indeed i have, sir,” was her answer. “she is great deal too ill to be
 moved. mr. jones says we must not think of moving her. we must trespass
 little longer on your kindness.”
 
“removed!” cried bingley. “it must not be thought of. my sister, i am
 sure, will not hear of her removal.”
 
“you may depend upon it, madam,” said miss bingley, with cold civility,
 “that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
 remains with us.”
 
mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
 
“i am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, i do not
 know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
 vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
 always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
 temper i ever met with. i often tell my other girls they are nothing to
 _her_. you have sweet room here, mr. bingley, and charming prospect
 over that gravel walk. i do not know place in the country that is
 equal to netherfield. you will not think of quitting it in hurry, i
 hope, though you have but short lease.”
 
“whatever i do is done in hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if i
 should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five
 minutes. at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here.”
 
“that is exactly what i should have supposed of you,” said elizabeth.
 
“you begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.
 
“oh yes--i understand you perfectly.”
 
“i wish i might take this for compliment; but to be so easily seen
 through, i am afraid, is pitiful.”
 
“that is as it happens. it does not necessarily follow that deep,
 intricate character is more or less estimable than such one as yours.”
 
“lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
 the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”
 
“i did not know before,” continued bingley, immediately, “that you were
 studier of character. it must be an amusing study.”
 
“yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. they have at
 least that advantage.”
 
“the country,” said darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for
 such study. in country neighbourhood you move in very confined and
 unvarying society.”
 
“but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
 observed in them for ever.”
 
“yes, indeed,” cried mrs. bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
 country neighbourhood. “i assure you there is quite as much of _that_
 going on in the country as in town.”
 
everybody was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for moment,
 turned silently away. mrs. bennet, who fancied she had gained complete
 victory over him, continued her triumph,--
 
“i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country, for
 my part, except the shops and public places. the country is vast deal
 pleasanter, is not it, mr. bingley?”
 
“when i am in the country,” replied, “i never wish to leave it; and
 when i am in town, it is pretty much the same. they have each their
 advantages, and i can be equally happy in either.”
 
“ay, that is because you have the right disposition. but that
 gentleman,” looking at darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
 at all.”
 
“indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said elizabeth, blushing for her
 mother. “you quite mistook mr. darcy. only meant that there was not
 such variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
 you must acknowledge to be true.”
 
“certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
 many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few
 neighbourhoods larger. i know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”
 
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
 countenance. his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
 mr. darcy with very expressive smile. elizabeth, for the sake of
 saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if
 charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away.
 
“yes, she called yesterday with her father. what an agreeable man sir
 william is, mr. bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so
 genteel and so easy! has always something to say to everybody. _that_
 is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
 important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”
 
“did charlotte dine with you?”
 
“no, she would go home. i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. for
 my part, mr. bingley, _i_ always keep servants that can do their own
 work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. but everybody is to
 judge for themselves, and the lucases are very good sort of girls, i
 assure you. it is pity they are not handsome! not that _i_ think
 charlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”
 
“she seems very pleasant young woman,” said bingley.
 
“oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. lady lucas herself
 has often said so, and envied jane’s beauty. i do not like to boast
 of my own child; but to be sure, jane--one does not often see anybody
 better looking. it is what everybody says. i do not trust my own
 partiality. when she was only fifteen there was gentleman at my
 brother gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my
 sister-in-law was sure would make her an offer before we came away.
 but, however, did not. perhaps thought her too young. however, he
 wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”
 
“and so ended his affection,” said elizabeth, impatiently. “there has
 been many one, i fancy, overcome in the same way. i wonder who first
 discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”
 
“i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said darcy.
 
“of fine, stout, healthy love it may. everything nourishes what is
 strong already. but if it be only slight, thin sort of inclination, i
 am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”
 
darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
 tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. she longed to
 speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after short silence mrs.
 bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to
 jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy. mr. bingley was
 unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
 civil also, and say what the occasion required. she performed her part,
 indeed, without much graciousness, but mrs. bennet was satisfied, and
 soon afterwards ordered her carriage. upon this signal, the youngest of
 her daughters put herself forward. the two girls had been whispering to
 each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the
 youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming
 into the country to give ball at netherfield.
 
lydia was stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with fine complexion
 and good-humoured countenance; favourite with her mother, whose
 affection had brought her into public at an early age. she had high
 animal spirits, and sort of natural self-consequence, which the
 attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her
 own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. she was
 very equal, therefore, to address mr. bingley on the subject of the
 ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be
 the most shameful thing in the world if did not keep it. his answer
 to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.
 
“i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when
 your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
 the ball. but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”
 
lydia declared herself satisfied. “oh yes--it would be much better to
 wait till jane was well; and by that time, most likely, captain carter
 would be at meryton again. and when you have given _your_ ball,” she
 added, “i shall insist on their giving one also. i shall tell colonel
 forster it will be quite shame if does not.”
 
mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned
 instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the
 remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy; the latter of whom, however,
 could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
 all miss bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.

chapter x.

the day passed much as the day before had done. mrs. hurst and miss
 bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
 continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, elizabeth joined
 their party in the drawing-room. the loo table, however, did not appear.
 mr. darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching
 the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
 messages to his sister. mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet, and
 mrs. hurst was observing their game.
 
elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
 attending to what passed between darcy and his companion. the perpetual
 commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
 of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
 with which her praises were received, formed curious dialogue, and was
 exactly in unison with her opinion of each.
 
“how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such letter!”
 
made answer.
 
“you write uncommonly fast.”
 
“you are mistaken. i write rather slowly.”
 
“how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
 year! letters of business, too! how odious i should think them!”
 
“it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”
 
“pray tell your sister that i long to see her.”
 
“i have already told her so once, by your desire.”
 
“i am afraid you do not like your pen. let mend it for you. i mend
 pens remarkably well.”
 
“thank you--but i always mend my own.”
 
“how can you contrive to write so even?”
 
was silent.
 
“tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
 and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
 little design for table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss
 grantley’s.”
 
“will you give leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at
 present i have not room to do them justice.”
 
“oh, it is of consequence. i shall see her in january. but do you
 always write such charming long letters to her, mr. darcy?”
 
“they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
 to determine.”
 
“it is rule with me, that person who can write long letter with
 ease cannot write ill.”
 
“that will not do for compliment to darcy, caroline,” cried her
 brother, “because does _not_ write with ease. studies too much
 for words of four syllables. do not you, darcy?”
 
“my style of writing is very different from yours.”
 
“oh,” cried miss bingley, “charles writes in the most careless way
 imaginable. leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”
 
“my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them; by which
 means my letters sometimes convey ideas at all to my correspondents.”
 
“your humility, mr. bingley,” said elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”
 
“nothing is more deceitful,” said darcy, “than the appearance of
 humility. it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
 indirect boast.”
 
“and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”
 
“the indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
 writing, because you consider them as proceeding from rapidity of
 thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
 think at least highly interesting. the power of doing anything with
 quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
 attention to the imperfection of the performance. when you told mrs.
 bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield
 you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be sort of
 panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very
 laudable in precipitance which must leave very necessary business
 undone, and can be of real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”
 
“nay,” cried bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
 foolish things that were said in the morning. and yet, upon my honour, i
 believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this
 moment. at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless
 precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”
 
“i daresay you believed it; but i am by means convinced that you
 would be gone with such celerity. your conduct would be quite as
 dependent on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were
 mounting your horse, friend were to say, ‘bingley, you had better stay
 till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not
 go--and, at another word, might stay month.”
 
“you have only proved by this,” cried elizabeth, “that mr. bingley did
 not do justice to his own disposition. you have shown him off now much
 more than did himself.”
 
“i am exceedingly gratified,” said bingley, “by your converting what my
 friend says into compliment on the sweetness of my temper. but i am
 afraid you are giving it turn which that gentleman did by means
 intend; for would certainly think the better of if, under such a
 circumstance, i were to give flat denial, and ride off as fast as i
 could.”
 
“would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
 as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”
 
“upon my word, i cannot exactly explain the matter--darcy must speak for
 himself.”
 
“you expect to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
 but which i have never acknowledged. allowing the case, however, to
 stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet,
 that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
 the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
 one argument in favour of its propriety.”
 
“to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of friend is merit
 with you.”
 
“to yield without conviction is compliment to the understanding of
 either.”
 
“you appear to me, mr. darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
 friendship and affection. regard for the requester would often make
 one readily yield to request, without waiting for arguments to reason
 one into it. i am not particularly speaking of such case as you have
 supposed about mr. bingley. we may as well wait, perhaps, till the
 circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
 thereupon. but in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,
 where one of them is desired by the other to change resolution of no
 very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
 with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”
 
“will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
 with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
 appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
 between the parties?”
 
“by all means,” cried bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
 forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more
 weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of. i assure
 you that if darcy were not such great tall fellow, in comparison with
 myself, i should not pay him half so much deference. i declare i do not
 know more awful object than darcy on particular occasions, and in
 particular places; at his own house especially, and of sunday evening,
 when has nothing to do.”
 
mr. darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that was
 rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. miss bingley warmly
 resented the indignity had received, in an expostulation with her
 brother for talking such nonsense.
 
“i see your design, bingley,” said his friend. “you dislike an argument,
 and want to silence this.”
 
“perhaps i do. arguments are too much like disputes. if you and miss
 bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very
 thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”
 
“what you ask,” said elizabeth, “is sacrifice on my side; and mr.
 darcy had much better finish his letter.”
 
mr. darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
 
when that business was over, applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
 for the indulgence of some music. miss bingley moved with alacrity to
 the pianoforte, and after polite request that elizabeth would lead the
 way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
 seated herself.
 
mrs. hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,
 elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
 that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr. darcy’s eyes were fixed
 on her. she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
 admiration to so great man, and yet that should look at her because
 disliked her was still more strange. she could only imagine, however,
 at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her
 more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
 any other person present. the supposition did not pain her. she liked
 him too little to care for his approbation.
 
after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a
 lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr. darcy, drawing near
 elizabeth, said to her,--
 
“do you not feel great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an
 opportunity of dancing reel?”
 
she smiled, but made answer. repeated the question, with some
 surprise at her silence.
 
“oh,” said she, “i heard you before; but i could not immediately
 determine what to say in reply. you wanted me, i know, to say ‘yes,’
 that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always
 delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating person of
 their premeditated contempt. i have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
 you that i do not want to dance reel at all; and now despise if you
 dare.”
 
“indeed i do not dare.”
 
elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
 gallantry; but there was mixture of sweetness and archness in her
 manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and darcy had
 never been so bewitched by any woman as was by her. really
 believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
 should be in some danger.
 
miss bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great
 anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some
 assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.
 
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
 their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
 
“i hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
 next day, “you will give your mother-in-law few hints, when this
 desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
 and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after
 the officers. and, if i may mention so delicate subject, endeavour to
 check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
 which your lady possesses.”
 
[illustration:
 
“no, no; stay where you are”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”
 
“oh yes. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed
 in the gallery at pemberley. put them next to your great-uncle the
 judge. they are in the same profession, you know, only in different
 lines. as for your elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it
 taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”
 
“it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their
 colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
 copied.”
 
at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurst and
 elizabeth herself.
 
“i did not know that you intended to walk,” said miss bingley, in some
 confusion, lest they had been overheard.
 
“you used us abominably ill,” answered mrs. hurst, “running away without
 telling us that you were coming out.”
 
then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy, she left elizabeth to walk
 by herself. the path just admitted three. mr. darcy felt their rudeness,
 and immediately said,--
 
“this walk is not wide enough for our party. we had better go into the
 avenue.”
 
but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
 laughingly answered,--
 
“no, no; stay where you are. you are charmingly grouped, and appear to
 uncommon advantage. the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
 fourth. good-bye.”
 
she then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of
 being at home again in day or two. jane was already so much recovered
 as to intend leaving her room for couple of hours that evening.

“piling up the fire”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 



chapter xi.
 

[illustration]
 
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister, and
 seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,
 where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of
 pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were
 during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. their powers
 of conversation were considerable. they could describe an entertainment
 with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their
 acquaintance with spirit.
 
but when the gentlemen entered, jane was longer the first object;
 miss bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had
 something to say to him before had advanced many steps. addressed
 himself directly to miss bennet with polite congratulation; mr. hurst
 also made her slight bow, and said was “very glad;” but diffuseness
 and warmth remained for bingley’s salutation. was full of joy and
 attention. the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
 should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,
 to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the
 door. then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
 elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
 delight.
 
when tea was over mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
 card-table--but in vain. she had obtained private intelligence that mr.
 darcy did not wish for cards, and mr. hurst soon found even his open
 petition rejected. she assured him that one intended to play, and the
 silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. mr.
 hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
 sofas and go to sleep. darcy took up book. miss bingley did the same;
 and mrs. hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
 rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with miss
 bennet.
 
miss bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr.
 darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
 perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. she
 could not win him, however, to any conversation; merely answered her
 question and read on. at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
 amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
 second volume of his, she gave great yawn and said, “how pleasant it
 is to spend an evening in this way! i declare, after all, there is no
 enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tires of anything than of a
 book! when i have house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not
 an excellent library.”
 
one made any reply. she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
 cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing
 her brother mentioning ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly
 towards him and said,--
 
“by the bye charles, are you really serious in meditating dance at
 netherfield? i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
 the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not
 some among us to whom ball would be rather punishment than a
 pleasure.”
 
“if you mean darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he
 chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite settled
 thing, and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send
 round my cards.”
 
“i should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were
 carried on in different manner; but there is something insufferably
 tedious in the usual process of such meeting. it would surely be much
 more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
 day.”
 
“much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say; but it would not be
 near so much like ball.”
 
miss bingley made answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about
 the room. her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but darcy, at
 whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. in the
 desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,
 turning to elizabeth, said,--
 
“miss eliza bennet, let persuade you to follow my example, and take a
 turn about the room. i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
 long in one attitude.”
 
elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. miss bingley
 succeeded less in the real object of her civility: mr. darcy looked
 up. was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
 elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. was
 directly invited to join their party, but declined it, observing that
 could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
 the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
 interfere. what could mean? she was dying to know what could be his
 meaning--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.
 
“not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, means to be
 severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
 nothing about it.”
 
miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in
 anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his
 two motives.
 
“i have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon
 as she allowed him to speak. “you either choose this method of passing
 the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret
 affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
 appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, i should be
 completely in your way; and if the second, i can admire you much better
 as i sit by the fire.”
 
“oh, shocking!” cried miss bingley. “i never heard anything so
 abominable. how shall we punish him for such speech?”
 
“nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said elizabeth. “we
 can all plague and punish one another. tease him--laugh at him. intimate
 as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”
 
“but upon my honour i do _not_. i do assure you that my intimacy has not
 yet taught _that_. tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! no,
 no; i feel may defy us there. and as to laughter, we will not expose
 ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without subject. mr.
 darcy may hug himself.”
 
“mr. darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried elizabeth. “that is an
 uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would
 be great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. i dearly love a
 laugh.”
 
“miss bingley,” said he, “has given credit for more than can be. the
 wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may
 be rendered ridiculous by person whose first object in life is a
 joke.”
 
“certainly,” replied elizabeth, “there are such people, but i hope i am
 not one of _them_. i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good. follies
 and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, i own, and i
 laugh at them whenever i can. but these, i suppose, are precisely what
 you are without.”
 
“perhaps that is not possible for anyone. but it has been the study of
 my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose strong
 understanding to ridicule.”
 
“such as vanity and pride.”
 
“yes, vanity is weakness indeed. but pride--where there is real
 superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”
 
elizabeth turned away to hide smile.
 
“your examination of mr. darcy is over, i presume,” said miss bingley;
 “and pray what is the result?”
 
“i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has defect. owns it
 himself without disguise.”
 
“no,” said darcy, “i have made such pretension. i have faults enough,
 but they are not, i hope, of understanding. my temper i dare not vouch
 for. it is, i believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the
 convenience of the world. i cannot forget the follies and vices of
 others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself. my
 feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. my temper
 would perhaps be called resentful. my good opinion once lost is lost for
 ever.”
 
“_that_ is failing, indeed!” cried elizabeth. “implacable resentment
 _is_ shade in character. but you have chosen your fault well. i
 really cannot _laugh_ at it. you are safe from me.”
 
“there is, i believe, in every disposition tendency to some particular
 evil, natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”
 
“and _your_ defect is propensity to hate everybody.”
 
“and yours,” replied, with smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand
 them.”
 
“do let us have little music,” cried miss bingley, tired of a
 conversation in which she had share. “louisa, you will not mind my
 waking mr. hurst.”
 
her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
 opened; and darcy, after few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for
 it. began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.

in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the
 next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
 them in the course of the day. but mrs. bennet, who had calculated on
 her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which
 would exactly finish jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive
 them with pleasure before. her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
 least not to elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. mrs.
 bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
 before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr. bingley
 and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
 well. against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively
 resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
 contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
 she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley’s carriage immediately, and at
 length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
 that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.
 
the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
 said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
 jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. miss bingley was
 then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike
 of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
 
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
 soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
 safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where
 she felt herself to be right.
 
to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence: elizabeth had been at
 netherfield long enough. she attracted him more than liked; and miss
 bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. he
 wisely resolved to be particularly careful that sign of admiration
 should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
 influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been
 suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
 in confirming or crushing it. steady to his purpose, scarcely spoke
 ten words to her through the whole of saturday: and though they were at
 one time left by themselves for half an hour, adhered most
 conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
 
on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
 all, took place. miss bingley’s civility to elizabeth increased at last
 very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted,
 after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
 see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most
 tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. elizabeth took leave of
 the whole party in the liveliest spirits.
 
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. mrs. bennet
 wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
 trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again. but their
 father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
 glad to see them; had felt their importance in the family circle. the
 evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
 animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and
 elizabeth.
 
they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
 nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of
 threadbare morality to listen to. catherine and lydia had information
 for them of different sort. much had been done, and much had been said
 in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of the officers
 had dined lately with their uncle; private had been flogged; and it
 had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married.

“i hope, my dear,” said mr. bennet to his wife, as they were at
 breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered good dinner to-day,
 because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”
 
“who do you mean, my dear? i know of nobody that is coming, i am sure,
 unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in; and i hope _my_ dinners
 are good enough for her. i do not believe she often sees such at home.”
 
“the person of whom i speak is gentleman and stranger.”
 
mrs. bennet’s eyes sparkled. “a gentleman and stranger! it is mr.
 bingley, i am sure. why, jane--you never dropped word of this--you sly
 thing! well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley.
 but--good lord! how unlucky! there is not bit of fish to be got
 to-day. lydia, my love, ring the bell. i must speak to hill this
 moment.”
 
“it is _not_ mr. bingley,” said her husband; “it is person whom i
 never saw in the whole course of my life.”
 
this roused general astonishment; and had the pleasure of being
 eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.
 
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, thus
 explained:--“about month ago i received this letter, and about a
 fortnight ago i answered it; for i thought it case of some delicacy,
 and requiring early attention. it is from my cousin, mr. collins, who,
 when i am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he
 pleases.”
 
“oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
 pray do not talk of that odious man. i do think it is the hardest thing
 in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
 children; and i am sure, if i had been you, i should have tried long ago
 to do something or other about it.”
 
jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
 they had often attempted it before: but it was subject on which mrs.
 bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
 bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from family of
 five daughters, in favour of man whom nobody cared anything about.
 
“it certainly is most iniquitous affair,” said mr. bennet; “and
 nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.
 but if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be little
 softened by his manner of expressing himself.”
 
“no, that i am sure i shall not: and i think it was very impertinent of
 him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. i hate such false
 friends. why could not keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
 did before him?”
 
“why, indeed, does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
 head, as you will hear.”
 
/* right “hunsford, near westerham, kent, _15th october_. */
 
“dear sir,
 
“the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
 father always gave much uneasiness; and, since i have had the
 misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the
 breach: but, for some time, i was kept back by my own doubts,
 fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for to be
 on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be
 at variance.”--‘there, mrs. bennet.’--“my mind, however, is now
 made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at easter,
 i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of
 the right honourable lady catherine bourgh, widow of sir lewis
 bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred to the
 valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
 endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
 ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
 which are instituted by the church of england. as clergyman,
 moreover, i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
 of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
 these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of
 good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my
 being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly
 overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered
 olive branch. i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
 means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to
 apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make
 them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. if you should
 have objection to receive into your house, i propose myself
 the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, monday,
 november 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your
 hospitality till the saturday se’nnight following, which i can do
 without any inconvenience, as lady catherine is far from objecting
 to my occasional absence on sunday, provided that some other
 clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. i remain, dear sir,
 with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your
 well-wisher and friend,
 
“william collins.”
 
“at four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”
 said mr. bennet, as folded up the letter. “he seems to be most
 conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, i doubt not, will
 prove valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so
 indulgent as to let him come to us again.”
 
“there is some sense in what says about the girls, however; and, if
 is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to
 discourage him.”
 
“though it is difficult,” said jane, “to guess in what way can mean
 to make us the atonement thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
 credit.”
 
elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady
 catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
 his parishioners whenever it were required.
 
“he must be an oddity, i think,” said she. “i cannot make him out. there
 is something very pompous in his style. and what can mean by
 apologizing for being next in the entail? we cannot suppose would
 help it, if could. can be sensible man, sir?”
 
“no, my dear; i think not. i have great hopes of finding him quite the
 reverse. there is mixture of servility and self-importance in his
 letter which promises well. i am impatient to see him.”
 
“in point of composition,” said mary, “his letter does not seem
 defective. the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i
 think it is well expressed.”
 
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
 degree interesting. it was next to impossible that their cousin should
 come in scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
 received pleasure from the society of man in any other colour. as for
 their mother, mr. collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,
 and she was preparing to see him with degree of composure which
 astonished her husband and daughters.
 
mr. collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
 politeness by the whole family. mr. bennet indeed said little; but the
 ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr. collins seemed neither in need
 of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. was tall,
 heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. his air was grave and
 stately, and his manners were very formal. had not been long seated
 before complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine family of
 daughters, said had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
 instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that did not
 doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. this
 gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but mrs.
 bennet, who quarrelled with compliments, answered most readily,--
 
“you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may
 prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. things are settled so
 oddly.”
 
“you allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”
 
“ah, sir, i do indeed. it is grievous affair to my poor girls, you
 must confess. not that i mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,
 i know, are all chance in this world. there is knowing how estates
 will go when once they come to be entailed.”
 
“i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
 could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing
 forward and precipitate. but i can assure the young ladies that i come
 prepared to admire them. at present i will not say more, but, perhaps,
 when we are better acquainted----”
 
was interrupted by summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
 other. they were not the only objects of mr. collins’s admiration. the
 hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
 and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs. bennet’s
 heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
 own future property. the dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;
 and begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its
 cookery was owing. but here was set right by mrs. bennet, who assured
 him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep good
 cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. begged
 pardon for having displeased her. in softened tone she declared
 herself not at all offended; but continued to apologize for about a
 quarter of an hour.

chapter xiv

during dinner, mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
 were withdrawn, thought it time to have some conversation with his
 guest, and therefore started subject in which expected him to
 shine, by observing that seemed very fortunate in his patroness. lady
 catherine bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
 comfort, appeared very remarkable. mr. bennet could not have chosen
 better. mr. collins was eloquent in her praise. the subject elevated him
 to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with most important aspect
 protested that had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
 person of rank--such affability and condescension, as had himself
 experienced from lady catherine. she had been graciously pleased to
 approve of both the discourses which had already had the honour of
 preaching before her. she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings,
 and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of
 quadrille in the evening. lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
 people, knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
 she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
 made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
 neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for week or
 two to visit his relations. she had even condescended to advise him to
 marry as soon as could, provided chose with discretion; and had
 once paid him visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
 approved all the alterations had been making, and had even vouchsafed
 to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.
 
“that is all very proper and civil, i am sure,” said mrs. bennet, “and i
 dare say she is very agreeable woman. it is pity that great ladies
 in general are not more like her. does she live near you, sir?”
 
“the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by lane
 from rosings park, her ladyship’s residence.”
 
“i think you said she was widow, sir? has she any family?”
 
“she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very
 extensive property.”
 
“ah,” cried mrs. bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than
 many girls. and what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?”
 
“she is most charming young lady, indeed. lady catherine herself says
 that, in point of true beauty, miss bourgh is far superior to the
 handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
 the young woman of distinguished birth. she is unfortunately of sickly
 constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
 accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as i am
 informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
 resides with them. but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
 to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”
 
“has she been presented? i do not remember her name among the ladies at
 court.”
 
“her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
 and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived
 the british court of its brightest ornament. her ladyship seemed pleased
 with the idea; and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
 offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
 ladies. i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her
 charming daughter seemed born to be duchess; and that the most
 elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
 her. these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
 it is sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
 pay.”
 
“you judge very properly,” said mr. bennet; “and it is happy for you
 that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. may i ask
 whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
 moment, or are the result of previous study?”
 
“they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though i
 sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
 compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to
 give them as unstudied an air as possible.”
 
mr. bennet’s expectations were fully answered. his cousin was as absurd
 as had hoped; and listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
 maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
 and, except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring partner
 in his pleasure.
 
by tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and mr. bennet was glad
 to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,
 glad to invite him

“protested
 that never read novels” h.t feb 94
 ]
 
to read aloud to the ladies. mr. collins readily assented, and book
 was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be
 from circulating library) started back, and, begging pardon,
 protested that never read novels. kitty stared at him, and lydia
 exclaimed. other books were produced, and after some deliberation he
 chose “fordyce’s sermons.” lydia gaped as opened the volume; and
 before had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
 interrupted him with,--
 
“do you know, mamma, that my uncle philips talks of turning away
 richard? and if does, colonel forster will hire him. my aunt told me
 so herself on saturday. i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more
 about it, and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town.”
 
lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr.
 collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--
 
“i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
 of serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. it amazes
 me, i confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
 them as instruction. but i will longer importune my young cousin.”
 
then, turning to mr. bennet, offered himself as his antagonist at
 backgammon. mr. bennet accepted the challenge, observing that acted
 very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. mrs.
 bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for lydia’s
 interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if would
 resume his book; but mr. collins, after assuring them that bore his
 young cousin ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
 affront, seated himself at another table with mr. bennet, and prepared
 for backgammon.

chapter xv.
 

[illustration]
 
mr. collins was not sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
 been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
 his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
 miserly father; and though belonged to one of the universities, he
 had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
 acquaintance. the subjection in which his father had brought him up had
 given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now good
 deal counteracted by the self-conceit of weak head, living in
 retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
 prosperity. fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
 bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
 felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
 mingling with very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
 clergyman, and his right as rector, made him altogether mixture of
 pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.
 
having now good house and very sufficient income, intended to
 marry; and in seeking reconciliation with the longbourn family had
 wife in view, as meant to choose one of the daughters, if found
 them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
 this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s
 estate; and thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
 suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
 part.
 
his plan did not vary on seeing them. miss bennet’s lovely face
 confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
 was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
 choice. the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in quarter
 of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with mrs. bennet before breakfast, a
 conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
 to the avowal of his hopes, that mistress for it might be found at
 longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
 encouragement, caution against the very jane had fixed on. “as to
 her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
 not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
 _eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to
 hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”
 
mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon
 done--done while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire. elizabeth, equally
 next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
 
mrs. bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
 two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
 the day before, was now high in her good graces.
 
lydia’s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten: every sister
 except mary agreed to go with her; and mr. collins was to attend them,
 at the request of mr. bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
 and have his library to himself; for thither mr. collins had followed
 him after breakfast, and there would continue, nominally engaged with
 one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr.
 bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford. such
 doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly. in his library had been
 always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as told
 elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
 house, was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,
 was most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in their
 walk; and mr. collins, being in fact much better fitted for walker
 than reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
 go.
 
in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
 cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton. the attention of
 the younger ones was then longer to be gained by _him_. their eyes
 were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and
 nothing less than very smart bonnet, indeed, or really new muslin in
 shop window, could recall them.
 
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by young man, whom
 they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
 with an officer on the other side of the way. the officer was the very
 mr. denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire, and
 bowed as they passed. all were struck with the stranger’s air, all
 wondered who could be; and kitty and lydia, determined if possible
 to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting
 something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the
 pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same
 spot. mr. denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
 introduce his friend, mr. wickham, who had returned with him the day
 before from town, and, was happy to say, had accepted commission in
 their corps. this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
 only regimentals to make him completely charming. his appearance was
 greatly in his favour: had all the best parts of beauty, fine
 countenance, good figure, and very pleasing address. the introduction
 was followed up on his side by happy readiness of conversation--a
 readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
 whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
 when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were
 seen riding down the street. on distinguishing the ladies of the group
 the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
 civilities. bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the
 principal object. was then, said, on his way to longbourn on
 purpose to inquire after her. mr. darcy corroborated it with bow, and
 was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they
 were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and elizabeth
 happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
 was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. both changed colour,
 one looked white, the other red. mr. wickham, after few moments,
 touched his hat--a salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return.
 what could be the meaning of it? it was impossible to imagine; it was
 impossible not to long to know.
 
in another minute mr. bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
 passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
 
mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
 mr. philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia’s
 pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs.
 philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
 invitation.
 
mrs. philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from
 their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly
 expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
 carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
 she had not happened to see mr. jones’s shopboy in the street, who had
 told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield,
 because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
 towards mr. collins by jane’s introduction of him. she received him with
 her very best politeness, which returned with as much more,
 apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
 her, which could not help flattering himself, however, might be
 justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
 her notice. mrs. philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
 breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
 by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
 could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr. denny had
 brought him from london, and that was to have lieutenant’s
 commission in the ----shire. she had been watching him the last hour,
 she said, as walked up and down the street,--and had mr. wickham
 appeared, kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;
 but unluckily one passed the windows now except few of the
 officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,
 disagreeable fellows.” some of them were to dine with the philipses the
 next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr.
 wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn
 would come in the evening. this was agreed to; and mrs. philips
 protested that they would have nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
 tickets, and little bit of hot supper afterwards. the prospect of such
 delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. mr.
 collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,
 with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.
 
as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
 between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or
 both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could more explain such
 behaviour than her sister.
 
mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs.
 philips’s manners and politeness. protested that, except lady
 catherine and her daughter, had never seen more elegant woman; for
 she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
 pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
 utterly unknown to her before. something, supposed, might be
 attributed to his connection with them, but yet had never met with so
 much attention in the whole course of his life.

as objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their
 aunt, and all mr. collins’s scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for
 single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
 conveyed him and his five cousins at suitable hour to meryton; and the
 girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
 that mr. wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in
 the house.
 
when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr.
 collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and was so much
 struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that declared he
 might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
 at rosings; comparison that did not at first convey much
 gratification; but when mrs. philips understood from him what rosings
 was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
 description of only one of lady catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found
 that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
 the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented comparison
 with the housekeeper’s room.
 
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion,
 with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
 improvements it was receiving, was happily employed until the
 gentlemen joined them; and found in mrs. philips very attentive
 listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
 heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
 soon as she could. to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
 and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
 their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the
 interval of waiting appeared very long. it was over at last, however.
 the gentlemen did approach: and when mr. wickham walked into the room,
 elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
 of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. the
 officers of the ----shire were in general very creditable,
 gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but
 mr, wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
 walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips,
 breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

“the officers of the ----shire”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
 turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom finally seated
 himself; and the agreeable manner in which immediately fell into
 conversation, though it was only on its being wet night, and on the
 probability of rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
 dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the
 skill of the speaker.
 
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the
 officers, mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
 ladies certainly was nothing; but had still at intervals kind
 listener in mrs. philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly
 supplied with coffee and muffin.
 
when the card tables were placed, had an opportunity of obliging her,
 in return, by sitting down to whist.
 
“i know little of the game at present,” said he, “but i shall be glad to
 improve myself; for in my situation of life----” mrs. philips was very
 thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
 
mr. wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
 received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia. at first there
 seemed danger of lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was most
 determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
 she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
 and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.
 allowing for the common demands of the game, mr. wickham was therefore
 at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,
 though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,
 the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy. she dared not even
 mention that gentleman. her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
 relieved. mr. wickham began the subject himself. inquired how far
 netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
 hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there.
 
“about month,” said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
 drop, added, “he is man of very large property in derbyshire, i
 understand.”
 
“yes,” replied wickham; “his estate there is noble one. clear ten
 thousand per annum. you could not have met with person more capable of
 giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been
 connected with his family, in particular manner, from my infancy.”
 
elizabeth could not but look surprised.
 
“you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after
 seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
 yesterday. are you much acquainted with mr. darcy?”
 
“as much as i ever wish to be,” cried elizabeth, warmly. “i have spent
 four days in the same house with him, and i think him very
 disagreeable.”
 
“i have right to give _my_ opinion,” said wickham, “as to his being
 agreeable or otherwise. i am not qualified to form one. i have known him
 too long and too well to be fair judge. it is impossible for _me_ to
 be impartial. but i believe your opinion of him would in general
 astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly
 anywhere else. here you are in your own family.”
 
“upon my word i say more _here_ than i might say in any house in the
 neighbourhood, except netherfield. is not at all liked in
 hertfordshire. everybody is disgusted with his pride. you will not find
 him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”
 
“i cannot pretend to be sorry,” said wickham, after short
 interruption, “that or that any man should not be estimated beyond
 their deserts; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen. the
 world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
 high and imposing manners, and sees him only as chooses to be seen.”
 
“i should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
 ill-tempered man.”
 
wickham only shook his head.
 
“i wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether is
 likely to be in this country much longer.”
 
“i do not at all know; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i
 was at netherfield. i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
 not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”
 
“oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr. darcy. if _he_
 wishes to avoid seeing _me_ must go. we are not on friendly terms,
 and it always gives pain to meet him, but i have reason for
 avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world--a sense of
 very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what is.
 his father, miss bennet, the late mr. darcy, was one of the best men
 that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be
 in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
 thousand tender recollections. his behaviour to myself has been
 scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and
 everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
 memory of his father.”
 
elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
 all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
 
mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the
 neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
 had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but
 very intelligible gallantry.
 
“it was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” added,
 “which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. i know it to be a
 most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend denny tempted me
 further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
 attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them.
 society, i own, is necessary to me. i have been disappointed man, and
 my spirits will not bear solitude. i _must_ have employment and society.
 military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have
 now made it eligible. the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i
 was brought up for the church; and i should at this time have been in
 possession of most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
 were speaking of just now.”
 
“indeed!”
 
“yes--the late mr. darcy bequeathed the next presentation of the best
 living in his gift. was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
 i cannot do justice to his kindness. meant to provide for amply,
 and thought had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
 elsewhere.”
 
“good heavens!” cried elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? how could his
 will be disregarded? why did not you seek legal redress?”
 
“there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
 give hope from law. man of honour could not have doubted the
 intention, but mr. darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as merely
 conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
 to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.
 certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i
 was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
 less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
 anything to deserve to lose it. i have warm unguarded temper, and i
 may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
 freely. i can recall nothing worse. but the fact is, that we are very
 different sort of men, and that hates me.”
 
“this is quite shocking! deserves to be publicly disgraced.”
 
“some time or other _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. till i
 can forget his father, i can never defy or expose _him_.”
 
elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
 ever as expressed them.
 
“but what,” said she, after pause, “can have been his motive? what can
 have induced him to behave so cruelly?”
 
“a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but
 attribute in some measure to jealousy. had the late mr. darcy liked me
 less, his might have borne with better; but his father’s uncommon
 attachment to irritated him, i believe, very early in life. had
 not temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
 of preference which was often given me.”
 
“i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked
 him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be
 despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
 descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
 this!”
 
after few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “i _do_
 remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of
 his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. his disposition
 must be dreadful.”
 
“i will not trust myself on the subject,” replied wickham; “_i_ can
 hardly be just to him.”
 
elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after time exclaimed, “to
 treat in such manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
 father!” she could have added, “a young man, too, like _you_, whose very
 countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” but she contented herself
 with--“and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
 childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest
 manner.”
 
“we were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
 part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,
 sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _my_
 father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr. philips,
 appears to do so much credit to; but gave up everything to be of use
 to the late mr. darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
 pemberley property. was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy, most
 intimate, confidential friend. mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to
 be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;
 and when, immediately before my father’s death, mr. darcy gave him a
 voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that felt it
 to be as much debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”
 
“how strange!” cried elizabeth. “how abominable! i wonder that the very
 pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you. if from better
 motive, that should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
 dishonesty i must call it.”
 
“it _is_ wonderful,” replied wickham; “for almost all his actions may be
 traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. it has
 connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. but we are none
 of us consistent; and in his behaviour to there were stronger
 impulses even than pride.”
 
“can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”
 
“yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money
 freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
 poor. family pride, and _filial_ pride, for is very proud of what his
 father was, have done this. not to appear to disgrace his family, to
 degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
 pemberley house, is powerful motive. has also _brotherly_ pride,
 which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him very kind and
 careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up
 as the most attentive and best of brothers.”
 
“what sort of girl is miss darcy?”
 
shook his head. “i wish i could call her amiable. it gives pain to
 speak ill of darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very
 proud. as child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
 of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. but she is
 nothing to now. she is handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
 and, i understand, highly accomplished. since her father’s death her
 home has been london, where lady lives with her, and superintends her
 education.”
 
after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not
 help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--
 
“i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley. how can mr. bingley,
 who seems good-humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable,
 be in friendship with such man? how can they suit each other? do you
 know mr. bingley?”
 
“not at all.”
 
“he is sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. cannot know what mr.
 darcy is.”
 
“probably not; but mr. darcy can please where chooses. does not
 want abilities. can be conversible companion if thinks it worth
 his while. among those who are at all his equals in consequence, is a
 very different man from what is to the less prosperous. his pride
 never deserts him; but with the rich is liberal-minded, just,
 sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing
 something for fortune and figure.”
 
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
 the other table, and mr. collins took his station between his cousin
 elizabeth and mrs. philips. the usual inquiries as to his success were
 made by the latter. it had not been very great; had lost every point;
 but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon, assured
 her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;
 that considered the money as mere trifle, and begged she would not
 make herself uneasy.
 
“i know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a
 card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i
 am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. there
 are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to lady
 catherine bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
 little matters.”
 
mr. wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing mr. collins for
 few moments, asked elizabeth in low voice whether her relations
 were very intimately acquainted with the family of bourgh.
 
“lady catherine bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a
 living. i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her
 notice, but certainly has not known her long.”
 
“you know of course that lady catherine bourgh and lady anne darcy
 were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy.”
 
“no, indeed, i did not. i knew nothing at all of lady catherine’s
 connections. i never heard of her existence till the day before
 yesterday.”
 
“her daughter, miss bourgh, will have very large fortune, and it is
 believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”
 
this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss
 bingley. vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
 affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if were already
 self-destined to another.
 
“mr. collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
 daughter; but, from some particulars that has related of her
 ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of
 her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”
 
“i believe her to be both in great degree,” replied wickham; “i have
 not seen her for many years; but i very well remember that i never liked
 her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. she has the
 reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe
 she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
 her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
 chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of
 the first class.”
 
elizabeth allowed that had given very rational account of it, and
 they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
 an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr.
 wickham’s attentions. there could be conversation in the noise of
 mrs. philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to
 everybody. whatever said, was said well; and whatever did, done
 gracefully. elizabeth went away with her head full of him. she could
 think of nothing but of mr. wickham, and of what had told her, all
 the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
 they went, for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent. lydia
 talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
 fish she had won; and mr. collins, in describing the civility of mr. and
 mrs. philips, protesting that did not in the least regard his losses
 at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
 that crowded his cousins, had more to say than could well manage
 before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.

elizabeth related to jane, the next day, what had passed between mr.
 wickham and herself. jane listened with astonishment and concern: she
 knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr.
 bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the
 veracity of young man of such amiable appearance as wickham. the
 possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to
 interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
 done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
 throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
 otherwise explained.
 
“they have both,” said she, “been deceived, i dare say, in some way or
 other, of which we can form idea. interested people have perhaps
 misrepresented each to the other. it is, in short, impossible for us to
 conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
 without actual blame on either side.”
 
“very true, indeed; and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in
 behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
 business? do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
 somebody.”
 
“laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh out of my
 opinion. my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what disgraceful light
 it places mr. darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a
 manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. it is
 impossible. man of common humanity, man who had any value for his
 character, could be capable of it. can his most intimate friends be so
 excessively deceived in him? oh no.”
 
“i can much more easily believe mr. bingley’s being imposed on than that
 mr. wickham should invent such history of himself as gave last
 night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. if it be not
 so, let mr. darcy contradict it. besides, there was truth in his looks.”
 
“it is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. one does not know what to
 think.”
 
“i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”
 
but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr.
 bingley, if _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when
 the affair became public.
 
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
 conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
 they had been speaking; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their
 personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was
 fixed for the following tuesday. the two ladies were delighted to see
 their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
 repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
 separation. to the rest of the family they paid little attention;
 avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth,
 and nothing at all to the others. they were soon gone again, rising from
 their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
 hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet’s civilities.
 
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
 female of the family. mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in
 compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
 receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself, instead of a
 ceremonious card. jane pictured to herself happy evening in the
 society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
 elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing great deal with mr.
 wickham, and of seeing confirmation of everything in mr. darcy’s look
 and behaviour. the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended
 less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they
 each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham,
 was by means the only partner who could satisfy them, and ball
 was, at any rate, ball. and even mary could assure her family that she
 had disinclination for it.
 
“while i can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. i
 think it is sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
 society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who
 consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
 everybody.”
 
elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
 not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins, she could not help asking
 him whether intended to accept mr. bingley’s invitation, and if he
 did, whether would think it proper to join in the evening’s
 amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that entertained no
 scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading rebuke,
 either from the archbishop or lady catherine bourgh, by venturing to
 dance.
 
“i am by means of opinion, i assure you,” said he, “that ball of
 this kind, given by young man of character, to respectable people, can
 have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing
 myself, that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
 cousins in the course of the evening; and i take this opportunity of
 soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a
 preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
 cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”
 
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. she had fully proposed being
 engaged by wickham for those very dances; and to have mr. collins
 instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. there was help
 for it, however. mr. wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce
 delayed little longer, and mr. collins’s proposal accepted with as
 good grace as she could. she was not the better pleased with his
 gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. it now first
 struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
 being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a
 quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
 the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
 civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
 compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
 gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
 her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
 was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. elizabeth, however, did not choose
 to take the hint, being well aware that serious dispute must be the
 consequence of any reply. mr. collins might never make the offer, and,
 till did, it was useless to quarrel about him.
 
if there had not been netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
 younger miss bennets would have been in pitiable state at this time;
 for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was
 such succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once. no
 aunt, officers, news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses
 for netherfield were got by proxy. even elizabeth might have found some
 trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement
 of her acquaintance with mr. wickham; and nothing less than dance on
 tuesday could have made such friday, saturday, sunday, and monday
 endurable to kitty and lydia.

chapter xviii.
 

[illustration]
 
till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield, and looked in
 vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
 doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. the certainty of
 meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
 might not unreasonably have alarmed her. she had dressed with more than
 usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
 that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
 might be won in the course of the evening. but in an instant arose the
 dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for mr. darcy’s
 pleasure, in the bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this
 was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
 pronounced by his friend mr. denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and
 who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
 the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with significant
 smile,--
 
“i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
 had not wished to avoid certain gentleman here.”
 
this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by
 elizabeth; and, as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
 wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
 of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
 disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
 the polite inquiries which directly afterwards approached to make.
 attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to wickham. she
 was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
 with degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
 speaking to mr. bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
 
but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
 of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
 spirits; and, having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she
 had not seen for week, she was soon able to make voluntary
 transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her
 particular notice. the two first dances, however, brought return of
 distress: they were dances of mortification. mr. collins, awkward and
 solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong
 without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a
 disagreeable partner for couple of dances can give. the moment of her
 release from him was ecstasy.
 
she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
 wickham, and of hearing that was universally liked. when those dances
 were over, she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with
 her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy, who took
 her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
 knowing what she did, she accepted him. walked away again
 immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
 mind: charlotte tried to console her.
 
“i dare say you will find him very agreeable.”
 
“heaven forbid! _that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! to find
 man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! do not wish such an
 evil.”
 
when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her
 hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her, in whisper, not to be a
 simpleton, and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
 in the eyes of man often times his consequence. elizabeth made no
 answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
 she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy, and
 reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
 they stood for some time without speaking word; and she began to
 imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at
 first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it
 would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,
 she made some slight observation on the dance. replied, and was again
 silent. after pause of some minutes, she addressed him second time,
 with--
 
“it is _your_ turn to say something now, mr. darcy. _i_ talked about the
 dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the
 room, or the number of couples.”
 
smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
 said.
 
“very well; that reply will do for the present. perhaps, by-and-by, i
 may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but
 _now_ we may be silent.”
 
“do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”
 
“sometimes. one must speak little, you know. it would look odd to be
 entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of
 _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
 trouble of saying as little as possible.”
 
“are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
 imagine that you are gratifying mine?”
 
“both,” replied elizabeth archly; “for i have always seen great
 similarity in the turn of our minds. we are each of an unsocial,
 taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
 something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
 posterity with all the _éclat_ of proverb.”
 
“this is very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure,”
 said he. “how near it may be to _mine_, i cannot pretend to say. _you_
 think it faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”
 
“i must not decide on my own performance.”
 
made answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down
 the dance, when asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
 walk to meryton. she answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist
 the temptation, added, “when you met us there the other day, we had just
 been forming new acquaintance.”
 
the effect was immediate. deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
 features, but said not word; and elizabeth, though blaming herself
 for her own weakness, could not go on. at length darcy spoke, and in a
 constrained manner said,--
 
“mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his
 _making_ friends; whether may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
 is less certain.”
 
“he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied elizabeth,
 with emphasis, “and in manner which is likely to suffer from all
 his life.”
 
darcy made answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. at
 that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
 through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving mr.
 darcy, stopped, with bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on
 his dancing and his partner.
 
“i have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very
 superior dancing is not often seen. it is evident that you belong to the
 first circles. allow to say, however, that your fair partner does not
 disgrace you: and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
 especially when certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza (glancing
 at her sister and bingley), shall take place. what congratulations will
 then flow in! i appeal to mr. darcy;--but let not interrupt you, sir.
 you will not thank for detaining you from the bewitching converse of
 that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”

the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir
 william’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
 eyes were directed, with very serious expression, towards bingley and
 jane, who were dancing together. recovering himself, however, shortly,
 turned to his partner, and said,--
 
“sir william’s interruption has made forget what we were talking
 of.”
 
“i do not think we were speaking at all. sir william could not have
 interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
 themselves. we have tried two or three subjects already without success,
 and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine.”
 
“what think you of books?” said he, smiling.
 
“books--oh no!--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
 feelings.”
 
“i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
 want of subject. we may compare our different opinions.”
 
“no--i cannot talk of books in ball-room; my head is always full of
 something else.”
 
“the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,
 with look of doubt.
 
“yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her
 thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
 by her suddenly exclaiming, “i remember hearing you once say, mr. darcy,
 that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was
 unappeasable. you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being
 created_?”
 
“i am,” said he, with firm voice.
 
“and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”
 
“i hope not.”
 
“it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
 to be secure of judging properly at first.”
 
“may i ask to what these questions tend?”
 
“merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring
 to shake off her gravity. “i am trying to make it out.”
 
“and what is your success?”
 
she shook her head. “i do not get on at all. i hear such different
 accounts of you as puzzle exceedingly.”
 
“i can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary
 greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were
 not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
 fear that the performance would reflect credit on either.”
 
“but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another
 opportunity.”
 
“i would by means suspend any pleasure of yours,” coldly replied.
 she said more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
 silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for
 in darcy’s breast there was tolerably powerful feeling towards her,
 which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
 another.
 
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and,
 with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--
 
“so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham?
 your sister has been talking to about him, and asking thousand
 questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his
 other communications, that was the of old wickham, the late mr.
 darcy’s steward. let recommend you, however, as friend, not to give
 implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to mr. darcy’s using
 him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, has been always
 remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a
 most infamous manner. i do not know the particulars, but i know very
 well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame; that cannot bear
 to hear george wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he
 could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he
 was excessively glad to find that had taken himself out of the way.
 his coming into the country at all is most insolent thing, indeed, and
 i wonder how could presume to do it. i pity you, miss eliza, for this
 discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his
 descent, one could not expect much better.”
 
“his guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”
 said elizabeth, angrily; “for i have heard you accuse him of nothing
 worse than of being the of mr. darcy’s steward, and of _that_, i can
 assure you, informed himself.”
 
“i beg your pardon,” replied miss bingley, turning away with sneer.
 “excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”
 
“insolent girl!” said elizabeth to herself. “you are much mistaken if
 you expect to influence by such paltry attack as this. i see
 nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr.
 darcy.” she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
 inquiries on the same subject of bingley. jane met her with smile of
 such sweet complacency, glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
 marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
 elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude
 for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave
 way before the hope of jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.
 
“i want to know,” said she, with countenance less smiling than her
 sister’s, “what you have learnt about mr. wickham. but perhaps you have
 been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case
 you may be sure of my pardon.”
 
“no,” replied jane, “i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing
 satisfactory to tell you. mr. bingley does not know the whole of his
 history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
 principally offended mr. darcy; but will vouch for the good conduct,
 the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
 mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than has
 received; and i am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his
 sister’s, mr. wickham is by means respectable young man. i am
 afraid has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr. darcy’s
 regard.”
 
“mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself.”
 
“no; never saw him till the other morning at meryton.”
 
“this account then is what has received from mr. darcy. i am
 perfectly satisfied. but what does say of the living?”
 
“he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though has heard
 them from mr. darcy more than once, but believes that it was left to
 him _conditionally_ only.”
 
“i have not doubt of mr. bingley’s sincerity,” said elizabeth warmly,
 “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. mr.
 bingley’s defence of his friend was very able one, i dare say; but
 since is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
 the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of
 both gentlemen as i did before.”
 
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
 which there could be difference of sentiment. elizabeth listened with
 delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of
 bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
 in it. on their being joined by mr. bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew
 to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
 partner she had scarcely replied, before mr. collins came up to them,
 and told her with great exultation, that had just been so fortunate
 as to make most important discovery.
 
“i have found out,” said he, “by singular accident, that there is now
 in the room near relation to my patroness. i happened to overhear the
 gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
 this house the names of his cousin miss bourgh, and of her mother,
 lady catherine. how wonderfully these sort of things occur! who would
 have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de
 bourgh in this assembly! i am most thankful that the discovery is made
 in time for to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do,
 and trust will excuse my not having done it before. my total
 ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”
 
“you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy?”
 
“indeed i am. i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
 i believe him to be lady catherine’s _nephew_. it will be in my power to
 assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”
 
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such scheme; assuring him
 that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
 an impertinent freedom, rather than compliment to his aunt; that it
 was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
 side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr. darcy, the superior in
 consequence, to begin the acquaintance. mr. collins listened to her with
 the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased
 speaking, replied thus,--
 
“my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your
 excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
 understanding, but permit to say that there must be wide difference
 between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those
 which regulate the clergy; for, give leave to observe that i consider
 the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
 in the kingdom--provided that proper humility of behaviour is at the
 same time maintained. you must, therefore, allow to follow the
 dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead to perform
 what i look on as point of duty. pardon for neglecting to profit by
 your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,
 though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education
 and habitual study to decide on what is right than young lady like
 yourself;” and with low bow left her to attack mr. darcy, whose
 reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
 being so addressed was very evident. her cousin prefaced his speech with
 solemn bow, and though she could not hear word of it, she felt as if
 hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”
 “hunsford,” and “lady catherine bourgh.” it vexed her to see him
 expose himself to such man. mr. darcy was eyeing him with
 unrestrained wonder; and when at last mr. collins allowed him to speak,
 replied with an air of distant civility. mr. collins, however, was not
 discouraged from speaking again, and mr. darcy’s contempt seemed
 abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the
 end of it only made him slight bow, and moved another way: mr.
 collins then returned to elizabeth.
 
“i have reason, i assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my
 reception. mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. answered
 with the utmost civility, and even paid the compliment of saying,
 that was so well convinced of lady catherine’s discernment as to be
 certain she could never bestow favour unworthily. it was really very
 handsome thought. upon the whole, i am much pleased with him.”
 
as elizabeth had longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
 her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley; and the
 train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made
 her perhaps almost as happy as jane. she saw her in idea settled in that
 very house, in all the felicity which marriage of true affection could
 bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
 even to like bingley’s two sisters. her mother’s thoughts she plainly
 saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,
 lest she might hear too much. when they sat down to supper, therefore,
 she considered it most unlucky perverseness which placed them within
 one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was
 talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing
 else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr.
 bingley. it was an animating subject, and mrs. bennet seemed incapable
 of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. his being such
 charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,
 were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a
 comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be
 certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. it
 was, moreover, such promising thing for her younger daughters, as
 jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;
 and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to
 consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might
 not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. it was necessary
 to make this circumstance matter of pleasure, because on such
 occasions it is the etiquette; but one was less likely than mrs.
 bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. she
 concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
 fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
 chance of it.
 
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s
 words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in less audible
 whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the
 chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy, who sat opposite to them. her
 mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
 
“what is mr. darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him? i am
 sure we owe him such particular civility as to be obliged to say
 nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”
 
“for heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. what advantage can it be to you
 to offend mr. darcy? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
 so doing.”
 
nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. her mother would
 talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. elizabeth blushed and
 blushed again with shame and vexation. she could not help frequently
 glancing her eye at mr. darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
 she dreaded; for though was not always looking at her mother, she was
 convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. the expression
 of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to composed and
 steady gravity.
 
at length, however, mrs. bennet had more to say; and lady lucas, who
 had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
 likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
 elizabeth now began to revive. but not long was the interval of
 tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
 had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty,
 preparing to oblige the company. by many significant looks and silent
 entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such proof of
 complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an
 opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
 elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and
 she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
 which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving
 amongst the thanks of the table the hint of hope that she might be
 prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half minute
 began another. mary’s powers were by means fitted for such display;
 her voice was weak, and her manner affected. elizabeth was in agonies.
 she looked at jane to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly
 talking to bingley. she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
 signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued, however,
 impenetrably grave. she looked at her father to entreat his
 interference, lest mary should be singing all night. took the hint,
 and, when mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--
 
“that will do extremely well, child. you have delighted us long enough.
 let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”
 
mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
 elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid
 her anxiety had done good. others of the party were now applied to.
 
“if i,” said mr. collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i
 should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an
 air; for i consider music as very innocent diversion, and perfectly
 compatible with the profession of clergyman. i do not mean, however,
 to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
 music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. the
 rector of parish has much to do. in the first place, must make such
 an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
 offensive to his patron. must write his own sermons; and the time
 that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
 and improvement of his dwelling, which cannot be excused from making
 as comfortable as possible. and i do not think it of light importance
 that should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards
 everybody, especially towards those to whom owes his preferment. i
 cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who
 should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody
 connected with the family.” and with bow to mr. darcy, concluded
 his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the
 room. many stared--many smiled; but one looked more amused than mr.
 bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for
 having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in half-whisper to lady
 lucas, that was remarkably clever, good kind of young man.
 
to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
 expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
 have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
 finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
 that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
 feelings were not of sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
 must have witnessed. that his two sisters and mr. darcy, however, should
 have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and
 she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
 the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
 
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement. she was teased by
 mr. collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he
 could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
 power to dance with others. in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
 somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the
 room. assured her that, as to dancing, was perfectly indifferent
 to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend
 himself to her; and that should therefore make point of remaining
 close to her the whole evening. there was arguing upon such a
 project. she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who
 often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged mr. collins’s conversation
 to herself.
 
she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy’s further notice:
 though often standing within very short distance of her, quite
 disengaged, never came near enough to speak. she felt it to be the
 probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham, and rejoiced in
 it.
 
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
 manœuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriage quarter of an
 hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
 heartily they were wished away by some of the family. mrs. hurst and her
 sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
 were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. they repulsed
 every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a
 languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long
 speeches of mr. collins, who was complimenting mr. bingley and his
 sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
 politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. darcy said
 nothing at all. mr. bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
 mr. bingley and jane were standing together little detached from the
 rest, and talked only to each other. elizabeth preserved as steady a
 silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too
 much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “lord,
 how tired i am!” accompanied by violent yawn.
 
when at length they arose to take leave, mrs. bennet was most pressingly
 civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and
 addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley, to assure him how happy
 would make them, by eating family dinner with them at any time,
 without the ceremony of formal invitation. bingley was all grateful
 pleasure; and readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
 waiting on her after his return from london, whither was obliged to
 go the next day for short time.
 
mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
 delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
 settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
 see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four
 months. of having another daughter married to mr. collins she thought
 with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
 elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
 man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
 was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield.

chapter xix.
 

[illustration]
 
the next day opened new scene at longbourn. mr. collins made his
 declaration in form. having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
 his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having
 feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
 moment, set about it in very orderly manner, with all the
 observances which supposed regular part of the business. on finding
 mrs. bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
 after breakfast, addressed the mother in these words,--
 
“may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth,
 when i solicit for the honour of private audience with her in the
 course of this morning?”
 
before elizabeth had time for anything but blush of surprise, mrs.
 bennet instantly answered,--
 
“oh dear! yes, certainly. i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am sure
 she can have objection. come, kitty, i want you upstairs.” and
 gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth
 called out,--
 
“dear ma’am, do not go. i beg you will not go. mr. collins must excuse
 me. can have nothing to say to that anybody need not hear. i am
 going away myself.”
 
“no, no, nonsense, lizzy. i desire you will stay where you are.” and
 upon elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
 to escape, she added, “lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
 mr. collins.”
 
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and moment’s
 consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
 over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
 to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided
 between distress and diversion. mrs. bennet and kitty walked off, and as
 soon as they were gone, mr. collins began,--
 
“believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
 doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. you
 would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
 unwillingness; but allow to assure you that i have your respected
 mother’s permission for this address. you can hardly doubt the purport
 of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
 dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. almost as
 soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my
 future life. but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
 subject, perhaps it will be advisable for to state my reasons for
 marrying--and, moreover, for coming into hertfordshire with the design
 of selecting wife, as i certainly did.”
 
the idea of mr. collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
 with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
 use the short pause allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
 continued,--
 
“my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it right thing for
 every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
 of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that i am convinced it will add
 very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps i ought to
 have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
 recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling
 patroness. twice has she condescended to give her opinion (unasked
 too!) on this subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i
 left hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while mrs. jenkinson was
 arranging miss bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘mr. collins, you
 must marry. clergyman like you must marry. choose properly, choose a
 gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,
 useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make small
 income go good way. this is my advice. find such woman as soon as
 you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.’ allow me, by the
 way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and
 kindness of lady catherine bourgh as among the least of the
 advantages in my power to offer. you will find her manners beyond
 anything i can describe; and your wit and vivacity, i think, must be
 acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
 which her rank will inevitably excite. thus much for my general
 intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
 were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i
 assure you there are many amiable young women. but the fact is, that
 being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
 father (who, however, may live many years longer), i could not satisfy
 myself without resolving to choose wife from among his daughters, that
 the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy
 event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be
 for several years. this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i
 flatter myself it will not sink in your esteem. and now nothing
 remains for but to assure you in the most animated language of the
 violence of my affection. to fortune i am perfectly indifferent, and
 shall make demand of that nature on your father, since i am well
 aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
 in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s
 decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. on that head,
 therefore, i shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that
 ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”
 
it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
 
“you are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “you forget that i have made no
 answer. let do it without further loss of time. accept my thanks for
 the compliment you are paying me. i am very sensible of the honour of
 your proposals, but it is impossible for to do otherwise than decline
 them.”
 
“i am not now to learn,” replied mr. collins, with formal wave of the
 hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
 man whom they secretly mean to accept, when first applies for their
 favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated second or even a
 third time. i am, therefore, by means discouraged by what you have
 just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”
 
“upon my word, sir,” cried elizabeth, “your hope is rather an
 extraordinary one after my declaration. i do assure you that i am not
 one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
 daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked second
 time. i am perfectly serious in my refusal. you could not make _me_
 happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
 would make _you_ so. nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i
 am persuaded she would find in every respect ill qualified for the
 situation.”
 
“were it certain that lady catherine would think so,” said mr. collins,
 very gravely--“but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
 disapprove of you. and you may be certain that when i have the honour of
 seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
 economy, and other amiable qualifications.”
 
“indeed, mr. collins, all praise of will be unnecessary. you must
 give leave to judge for myself, and pay the compliment of
 believing what i say. i wish you very happy and very rich, and by
 refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
 in making the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
 feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn
 estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. this matter may be
 considered, therefore, as finally settled.” and rising as she thus
 spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr. collins thus
 addressed her,--
 
“when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, i
 shall hope to receive more favourable answer than you have now given
 me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i
 know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject man on the
 first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to
 encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
 female character.”
 
“really, mr. collins,” cried elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me
 exceedingly. if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
 of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such way as
 may convince you of its being one.”
 
“you must give leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
 refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. my reasons for
 believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to that my hand
 is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer
 would be any other than highly desirable. my situation in life, my
 connections with the family of bourgh, and my relationship to your
 own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into
 further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is
 by means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.
 your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo
 the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. as i must,
 therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i
 shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
 suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”
 
“i do assure you, sir, that i have pretensions whatever to that kind
 of elegance which consists in tormenting respectable man. i would
 rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. i thank you
 again and again for the honour you have done in your proposals, but
 to accept them is absolutely impossible. my feelings in every respect
 forbid it. can i speak plainer? do not consider now as an elegant
 female intending to plague you, but as rational creature speaking the
 truth from her heart.”
 
“you are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward
 gallantry; “and i am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express
 authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
 being acceptable.”
 
to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no
 reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he
 persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
 encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
 in such manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
 not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.

mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
 successful love; for mrs. bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
 to watch for the end of the conference, sooner saw elizabeth open the
 door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
 entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
 warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. mr. collins
 received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
 proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
 of which trusted had every reason to be satisfied, since the
 refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
 from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
 
this information, however, startled mrs. bennet: she would have been
 glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
 him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
 and could not help saying so.
 
“but depend upon it, mr. collins,” she added, “that lizzy shall be
 brought to reason. i will speak to her about it myself directly. she is
 very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
 i will _make_ her know it.”
 
“pardon for interrupting you, madam,” cried mr. collins; “but if she
 is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would
 altogether be very desirable wife to man in my situation, who
 naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. if, therefore, she
 actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
 force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of
 temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”
 
“sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said mrs. bennet, alarmed. “lizzy is
 only headstrong in such matters as these. in everything else she is as
 good-natured girl as ever lived. i will go directly to mr. bennet, and
 we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure.”
 
she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
 husband, called out, as she entered the library,--
 
“oh, mr. bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
 you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins, for she vows she will
 not have him; and if you do not make haste will change his mind and
 not have _her_.”
 
mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
 on her face with calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by
 her communication.
 
“i have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had
 finished her speech. “of what are you talking?”
 
“of mr. collins and lizzy. lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins,
 and mr. collins begins to say that will not have lizzy.”
 
“and what am i to do on the occasion? it seems hopeless business.”
 
“speak to lizzy about it yourself. tell her that you insist upon her
 marrying him.”
 
“let her be called down. she shall hear my opinion.”
 
mrs. bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
 library.
 
“come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “i have sent for
 you on an affair of importance. i understand that mr. collins has made
 you an offer of marriage. is it true?”
 
elizabeth replied that it was.
 
“very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”
 
“i have, sir.”
 
“very well. we now come to the point. your mother insists upon your
 accepting it. is it not so, mrs. bennet?”
 
“yes, or i will never see her again.”
 
“an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth. from this day you must
 be stranger to one of your parents. your mother will never see you
 again if you do _not_ marry mr. collins, and i will never see you again
 if you _do_.”
 
elizabeth could not but smile at such conclusion of such beginning;
 but mrs. bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
 affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
 
“what do you mean, mr. bennet, by talking in this way? you promised me
 to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”
 
“my dear,” replied her husband, “i have two small favours to request.
 first, that you will allow the free use of my understanding on the
 present occasion; and, secondly, of my room. i shall be glad to have the
 library to myself as soon as may be.”
 
not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
 mrs. bennet give up the point. she talked to elizabeth again and again;
 coaxed and threatened her by turns. she endeavoured to secure jane in
 her interest, but jane, with all possible mildness, declined
 interfering; and elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
 sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. though her manner
 varied, however, her determination never did.
 
mr. collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
 thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
 could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, suffered in other
 way. his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
 deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
 
while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend
 the day with them. she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to
 her, cried in half whisper, “i am glad you are come, for there is such
 fun here! what do you think has happened this morning? mr. collins has
 made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him.”
 
[illustration:
 
“they entered the breakfast room”
 ]
 
charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty,
 who came to tell the same news; and sooner had they entered the
 breakfast-room, where mrs. bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
 the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating
 her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of her
 family. “pray do, my dear miss lucas,” she added, in melancholy tone;
 “for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; i am cruelly used,
 nobody feels for my poor nerves.”
 
charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.
 
“ay, there she comes,” continued mrs. bennet, “looking as unconcerned as
 may be, and caring more for us than if we were at york, provided she
 can have her own way. but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take it
 into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
 you will never get husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is
 to maintain you when your father is dead. _i_ shall not be able to keep
 you--and so i warn you. i have done with you from this very day. i told
 you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you again,
 and you will find as good as my word. i have pleasure in talking
 to undutiful children. not that i have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
 to anybody. people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have
 great inclination for talking. nobody can tell what i suffer! but it
 is always so. those who do not complain are never pitied.”
 
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
 attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.
 she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
 they were joined by mr. collins, who entered with an air more stately
 than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--
 
“now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
 let mr. collins and have little conversation together.”
 
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but
 lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte,
 detained first by the civility of mr. collins, whose inquiries after
 herself and all her family were very minute, and then by little
 curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
 not to hear. in doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected
 conversation:--
 
“oh, mr. collins!”
 
“my dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.
 far be it from me,” presently continued, in voice that marked his
 displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. resignation to
 inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of young man
 who has been so fortunate as i have been, in early preferment; and, i
 trust, i am resigned. perhaps not the less so from feeling doubt of my
 positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured with her hand; for i
 have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the
 blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.
 you will not, i hope, consider as showing any disrespect to your
 family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
 daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the
 compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.
 my conduct may, i fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
 dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all
 liable to error. i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
 my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
 consideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_
 has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologize.”

chapter xxi.

the discussion of mr. collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and
 elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
 attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.
 as for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
 by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
 stiffness of manner and resentful silence. scarcely ever spoke to
 her; and the assiduous attentions which had been so sensible of
 himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose
 civility in listening to him was seasonable relief to them all, and
 especially to her friend.
 
the morrow produced abatement of mrs. bennet’s ill humour or ill
 health. mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride. elizabeth
 had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
 not appear in the least affected by it. was always to have gone on
 saturday, and to saturday still meant to stay.
 
after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton, to inquire if mr. wickham
 were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.
 joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
 aunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were
 well talked over. to elizabeth, however, voluntarily acknowledged
 that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.
 
“i found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that i had better not meet
 mr. darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
 many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes
 might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”
 
she highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for full
 discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly
 bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with
 them to longbourn, and during the walk particularly attended to her.
 his accompanying them was double advantage: she felt all the
 compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an
 occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
 
[illustration: “walked back with them”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
soon after their return, letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came
 from netherfield, and was opened immediately. the envelope contained a
 sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with lady’s
 fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as
 she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
 jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to
 join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but
 elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
 even from wickham; and sooner had and his companion taken leave,
 than glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs. when they
 had gained their own room, jane, taking out her letter, said, “this is
 from caroline bingley: what it contains has surprised good deal.
 the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way
 to town; and without any intention of coming back again. you shall hear
 what she says.”
 
she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
 of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
 and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr.
 hurst had house. the next was in these words:--“‘i do not pretend to
 regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society, my
 dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many
 returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the
 meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by very frequent and most
 unreserved correspondence. i depend on you for that.’” to these
 high-flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
 distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
 saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their
 absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley’s being there; and as
 to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon
 cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.
 
“it is unlucky,” said she, after short pause, “that you should not be
 able to see your friends before they leave the country. but may we not
 hope that the period of future happiness, to which miss bingley looks
 forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
 intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
 satisfaction as sisters? mr. bingley will not be detained in london by
 them.”
 
“caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
 hertfordshire this winter. i will read it to you.
 
“‘when my brother left us yesterday, imagined that the business which
 took him to london might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
 are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
 charles gets to town will be in hurry to leave it again, we have
 determined on following him thither, that may not be obliged to spend
 his vacant hours in comfortless hotel. many of my acquaintance are
 already there for the winter: i wish i could hear that you, my dearest
 friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that i
 despair. i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in
 the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
 will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of
 whom we shall deprive you.’
 
“it is evident by this,” added jane, “that comes back more this
 winter.”
 
“it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean _should_.”
 
“why will you think so? it must be his own doing; is his own master.
 but you do not know _all_. i _will_ read you the passage which
 particularly hurts me. i will have reserves from _you_. ‘mr. darcy is
 impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely
 less eager to meet her again. i really do not think georgiana darcy has
 her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection
 she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still
 more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being
 hereafter our sister. i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to
 you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the country
 without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them
 unreasonable. my brother admires her greatly already; will have
 frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her
 relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and sister’s
 partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most
 capable of engaging any woman’s heart. with all these circumstances to
 favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest
 jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
 of so many?’ what think you of _this_ sentence, my dear lizzy?” said
 jane, as she finished it. “is it not clear enough? does it not expressly
 declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes to be her sister;
 that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that
 if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most
 kindly!) to put on my guard. can there be any other opinion on the
 subject?”
 
“yes, there can; for mine is totally different. will you hear it?”
 
“most willingly.”
 
“you shall have it in few words. miss bingley sees that her brother is
 in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy. she follows him to
 town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
 does not care about you.”
 
jane shook her head.
 
“indeed, jane, you ought to believe me. one who has ever seen you
 together can doubt his affection; miss bingley, i am sure, cannot: she
 is not such simpleton. could she have seen half as much love in mr.
 darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. but the
 case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
 is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion
 that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble
 in achieving second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i
 dare say it would succeed if miss bourgh were out of the way. but, my
 dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because miss bingley
 tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, is in the smallest
 degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when took leave of you on
 tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
 of being in love with you, is very much in love with her friend.”
 
“if we thought alike of miss bingley,” replied jane, “your
 representation of all this might make quite easy. but i know the
 foundation is unjust. caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
 anyone; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
 herself.”
 
“that is right. you could not have started more happy idea, since you
 will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.
 you have now done your duty by her, and must fret longer.”
 
“but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in
 accepting man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
 elsewhere?”
 
“you must decide for yourself,” said elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
 deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
 more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you,
 by all means, to refuse him.”
 
“how can you talk so?” said jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,
 though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could
 not hesitate.”
 
“i did not think you would; and that being the case, i cannot consider
 your situation with much compassion.”
 
“but if returns more this winter, my choice will never be
 required. thousand things may arise in six months.”
 
the idea of his returning more elizabeth treated with the utmost
 contempt. it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline’s
 interested wishes; and she could not for moment suppose that those
 wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence young man
 so totally independent of everyone.
 
she represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on
 the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
 jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,
 though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
 bingley would return to netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.
 
they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the
 family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;
 but even this partial communication gave her great deal of concern,
 and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
 to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. after
 lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of
 thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at
 longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,
 that, though had been invited only to family dinner, she would take
 care to have two full courses.

chapter xxii.

the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases; and again, during the
 chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins.
 elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “it keeps him in good
 humour,” said she, “and i am more obliged to you than i can express.”
 
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
 that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. this was
 very amiable; but charlotte’s kindness extended farther than elizabeth
 had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her
 from any return of mr. collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards
 herself. such was miss lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so
 favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
 sure of success if had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.
 but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
 character; for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
 morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
 himself at her feet. was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
 from conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
 conjecture his design, and was not willing to have the attempt known
 till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost
 secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
 was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday. his
 reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. miss lucas
 perceived him from an upper window as walked towards the house, and
 instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. but little had
 she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
 
in as short time as mr. collins’s long speeches would allow,
 everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
 they entered the house, earnestly entreated her to name the day that
 was to make him the happiest of men; and though such solicitation must
 be waived for the present, the lady felt inclination to trifle with
 his happiness. the stupidity with which was favoured by nature must
 guard his courtship from any charm that could make woman wish for its
 continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
 disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
 establishment were gained.
 
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
 and it was bestowed with most joyful alacrity. mr. collins’s present
 circumstances made it most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
 they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
 exceedingly fair. lady lucas began directly to calculate, with more
 interest than the matter had ever
 
[illustration:
 
“so much love and eloquence”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
excited before, how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live; and
 sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever mr. collins
 should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly
 expedient that both and his wife should make their appearance at st.
 james’s. the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the
 occasion. the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ year or two
 sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved
 from their apprehension of charlotte’s dying an old maid. charlotte
 herself was tolerably composed. she had gained her point, and had time
 to consider of it. her reflections were in general satisfactory. mr.
 collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was
 irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. but still would
 be her husband. without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,
 marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable
 provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however
 uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative
 from want. this preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of
 twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good
 luck of it. the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the
 surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she
 valued beyond that of any other person. elizabeth would wonder, and
 probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
 shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation. she resolved
 to give her the information herself; and therefore charged mr. collins,
 when returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop hint of what had
 passed before any of the family. promise of secrecy was of course very
 dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
 curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
 questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and was
 at the same time exercising great self-denial, for was longing to
 publish his prosperous love.
 
as was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of
 the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies
 moved for the night; and mrs. bennet, with great politeness and
 cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again,
 whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.
 
“my dear madam,” replied, “this invitation is particularly
 gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you
 may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
 possible.”
 
they were all astonished; and mr. bennet, who could by means wish for
 so speedy return, immediately said,--
 
“but is there not danger of lady catherine’s disapprobation here, my
 good sir? you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
 offending your patroness.”
 
“my dear sir,” replied mr. collins, “i am particularly obliged to you
 for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
 material step without her ladyship’s concurrence.”
 
“you cannot be too much on your guard. risk anything rather than her
 displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
 again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
 and be satisfied that _we_ shall take offence.”
 
“believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
 affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive
 from letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of
 your regard during my stay in hertfordshire. as for my fair cousins,
 though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall
 now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
 my cousin elizabeth.”
 
with proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
 surprised to find that meditated quick return. mrs. bennet wished
 to understand by it that thought of paying his addresses to one of
 her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a
 solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no
 means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and
 improve himself by such an example as hers, might become very
 agreeable companion. but on the following morning every hope of this
 kind was done away. miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
 private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.
 
the possibility of mr. collins’s fancying himself in love with her
 friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two: but
 that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility
 as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was
 consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
 she could not help crying out,--
 
“engaged to mr. collins! my dear charlotte, impossible!”
 
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
 story gave way to momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
 reproach; though, as it was more than she expected, she soon regained
 her composure, and calmly replied,--
 
“why should you be surprised, my dear eliza? do you think it incredible
 that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,
 because was not so happy as to succeed with you?”
 
but elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making strong effort
 for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the
 prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she
 wished her all imaginable happiness.
 
“i see what you are feeling,” replied charlotte; “you must be surprised,
 very much surprised, so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you.
 but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be
 satisfied with what i have done. i am not romantic, you know. i never
 was. i ask only comfortable home; and, considering mr. collins’s
 character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my
 chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
 entering the marriage state.”
 
elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,
 they returned to the rest of the family. charlotte did not stay much
 longer; and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. it
 was long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
 unsuitable match. the strangeness of mr. collins’s making two offers
 of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
 accepted. she had always felt that charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was
 not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible
 that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
 feeling to worldly advantage. charlotte, the wife of mr. collins, was a
 most humiliating picture! and to the pang of friend disgracing
 herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
 that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
 she had chosen.

chapter xxiii.
 

[illustration]
 
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
 she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,
 when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
 announce her engagement to the family. with many compliments to them,
 and much self-gratulation on the prospect of connection between the
 houses, unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
 but incredulous; for mrs. bennet, with more perseverance than
 politeness, protested must be entirely mistaken; and lydia, always
 unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--
 
“good lord! sir william, how can you tell such story? do not you know
 that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy?”
 
nothing less than the complaisance of courtier could have borne
 without anger such treatment: but sir william’s good-breeding carried
 him through it all; and though begged leave to be positive as to the
 truth of his information, listened to all their impertinence with the
 most forbearing courtesy.
 
elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
 situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
 mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and
 endeavoured to put stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
 by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she
 was readily joined by jane, and by making variety of remarks on the
 happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
 of mr. collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.
 
mrs. bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say great deal while
 sir william remained; but sooner had left them than her feelings
 found rapid vent. in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
 the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr. collins
 had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
 together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. two
 inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
 elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
 she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
 points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. nothing could
 console and nothing appease her. nor did that day wear out her
 resentment. week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
 scolding her: month passed away before she could speak to sir william
 or lady lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she
 could at all forgive their daughter.
 
mr. bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
 as did experience pronounced to be of most agreeable sort; for
 it gratified him, said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom had
 been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
 more foolish than his daughter!
 
jane confessed herself little surprised at the match: but she said
 less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
 nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. kitty and
 lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr. collins was only a
 clergyman; and it affected them in other way than as piece of news
 to spread at meryton.
 
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
 mrs. bennet the comfort of having daughter well married; and she
 called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
 though mrs. bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
 enough to drive happiness away.
 
between elizabeth and charlotte there was restraint which kept them
 mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no
 real confidence could ever subsist between them again. her
 disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
 sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
 never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
 bingley had now been gone week, and nothing was heard of his return.
 
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
 the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. the promised
 letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their
 father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
 twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. after
 discharging his conscience on that head, proceeded to inform them,
 with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the
 affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained
 that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that had
 been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at
 longbourn, whither hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight;
 for lady catherine, added, so heartily approved his marriage, that
 she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which trusted would
 be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early
 day for making him the happiest of men.
 
mr. collins’s return into hertfordshire was longer matter of
 pleasure to mrs. bennet. on the contrary, she was as much disposed to
 complain of it as her husband. it was very strange that should come
 to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient
 and exceedingly troublesome. she hated having visitors in the house
 while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
 most disagreeable. such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet, and they
 gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley’s continued
 absence.
 
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. day after
 day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
 report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming more to
 netherfield the whole winter; report which highly incensed mrs.
 bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as most scandalous
 falsehood.
 
even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that
 his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. unwilling as she
 was to admit an idea so destructive to jane’s happiness, and so
 dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
 frequently recurring. the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,
 and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss
 darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for
 the strength of his attachment.
 
as for jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
 painful than elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of
 concealing; and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject
 was never alluded to. but as such delicacy restrained her mother, an
 hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her
 impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he
 did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. it needed all
 jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
 tranquillity.
 
mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his
 reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
 first introduction. was too happy, however, to need much attention;
 and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
 from great deal of his company. the chief of every day was spent by
 him at lucas lodge, and sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
 to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
 
[illustration:
 
“_whenever she spoke in low voice_”
 ]
 
mrs. bennet was really in most pitiable state. the very mention of
 anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and
 wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. the sight of
 miss lucas was odious to her. as her successor in that house, she
 regarded her with jealous abhorrence. whenever charlotte came to see
 them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
 whenever she spoke in low voice to mr. collins, was convinced that
 they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
 and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr. bennet was dead. she
 complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
 
“indeed, mr. bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that charlotte
 lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _i_ should be forced
 to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”
 
“my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. let us hope for
 better things. let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor.”
 
this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet; and, therefore, instead of
 making any answer, she went on as before.
 
“i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. if it was
 not for the entail, i should not mind it.”
 
“what should not you mind?”
 
“i should not mind anything at all.”
 
“let us be thankful that you are preserved from state of such
 insensibility.”
 
“i never can be thankful, mr. bennet, for anything about the entail. how
 anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own
 daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr. collins, too!
 why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”
 
“i leave it to yourself to determine,” said mr. bennet.

chapter xxiv.
 

[illustration]
 
miss bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. the very first
 sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
 the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had
 time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before left
 the country.
 
hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of
 the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
 writer, that could give her any comfort. miss darcy’s praise occupied
 the chief of it. her many attractions were again dwelt on; and caroline
 boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
 the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
 letter. she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an
 inmate of mr. darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
 the latter with regard to new furniture.
 
elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
 heard it in silent indignation. her heart was divided between concern
 for her sister and resentment against all others. to caroline’s
 assertion of her brother’s being partial to miss darcy, she paid no
 credit. that was really fond of jane, she doubted more than she
 had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
 could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
 of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
 of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
 the caprice of their inclinations. had his own happiness, however, been
 the only sacrifice, might have been allowed to sport with it in
 whatever manner thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as
 she thought must be sensible himself. it was subject, in short, on
 which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. she
 could think of nothing else; and yet, whether bingley’s regard had
 really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;
 whether had been aware of jane’s attachment, or whether it had
 escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of
 him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s
 situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.
 
day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
 elizabeth; but at last, on mrs. bennet’s leaving them together, after a
 longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could
 not help saying,--
 
“o that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no
 idea of the pain she gives by her continual reflections on him. but i
 will not repine. it cannot last long. will be forgot, and we shall
 all be as we were before.”
 
elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
 nothing.
 
“you doubt me,” cried jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no
 reason. may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
 acquaintance but that is all. i have nothing either to hope or fear, and
 nothing to reproach him with. thank god i have not _that_ pain. little
 time, therefore--i shall certainly try to get the better----”
 
with stronger voice she soon added, “i have this comfort immediately,
 that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
 has done harm to anyone but myself.”
 
“my dear jane,” exclaimed elizabeth, “you are too good. your sweetness
 and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to
 you. i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you
 deserve.”
 
miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
 the praise on her sister’s warm affection.
 
“nay,” said elizabeth, “this is not fair. _you_ wish to think all the
 world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody. _i_ only want
 to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. do not be
 afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
 privilege of universal good-will. you need not. there are few people
 whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well. the more i see
 of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
 my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
 little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
 or sense. i have met with two instances lately: one i will not mention,
 the other is charlotte’s marriage. it is unaccountable! in every view it
 is unaccountable!”
 
“my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. they will
 ruin your happiness. you do not make allowance enough for difference of
 situation and temper. consider mr. collins’s respectability, and
 charlotte’s prudent, steady character. remember that she is one of a
 large family; that as to fortune it is most eligible match; and be
 ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like
 regard and esteem for our cousin.”
 
“to oblige you, i would try to believe almost anything, but one else
 could be benefited by such belief as this; for were i persuaded that
 charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her
 understanding than i now do of her heart. my dear jane, mr. collins is a
 conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know is, as well as
 i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries him
 cannot have proper way of thinking. you shall not defend her, though
 it is charlotte lucas. you shall not, for the sake of one individual,
 change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
 yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
 danger security for happiness.”
 
“i must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied
 jane; “and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
 together. but enough of this. you alluded to something else. you
 mentioned _two_ instances. i cannot misunderstand you, but i entreat
 you, dear lizzy, not to pain by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
 saying your opinion of him is sunk. we must not be so ready to fancy
 ourselves intentionally injured. we must not expect lively young man
 to be always so guarded and circumspect. it is very often nothing but
 our own vanity that deceives us. women fancy admiration means more than
 it does.”
 
“and men take care that they should.”
 
“if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have idea
 of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”
 
“i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingley’s conduct to design,”
 said elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
 unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. thoughtlessness,
 want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,
 will do the business.”
 
“and do you impute it to either of those?”
 
“yes; to the last. but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i
 think of persons you esteem. stop me, whilst you can.”
 
“you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”
 
“yes, in conjunction with his friend.”
 
“i cannot believe it. why should they try to influence him? they can
 only wish his happiness; and if is attached to other woman can
 secure it.”
 
“your first position is false. they may wish many things besides his
 happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
 may wish him to marry girl who has all the importance of money, great
 connections, and pride.”
 
“beyond doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy,” replied jane;
 “but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. they have
 known her much longer than they have known me; wonder if they love
 her better. but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
 they should have opposed their brother’s. what sister would think
 herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
 objectionable? if they believed him attached to they would not try to
 part us; if were so, they could not succeed. by supposing such an
 affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and most
 unhappy. do not distress by the idea. i am not ashamed of having been
 mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
 what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. let take it
 in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”
 
elizabeth could not oppose such wish; and from this time mr. bingley’s
 name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
 
mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
 more; and though day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
 for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
 with less perplexity. her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
 she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely
 the effect of common and transient liking, which ceased when saw
 her more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
 the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. mrs. bennet’s best
 comfort was, that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer.
 
mr. bennet treated the matter differently. “so, lizzy,” said he, one
 day, “your sister is crossed in love, i find. i congratulate her. next
 to being married, girl likes to be crossed in love little now and
 then. it is something to think of, and gives her sort of distinction
 among her companions. when is your turn to come? you will hardly bear to
 be long outdone by jane. now is your time. here are officers enough at
 meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. let wickham
 be your man. is pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”
 
“thank you, sir, but less agreeable man would satisfy me. we must not
 all expect jane’s good fortune.”
 
“true,” said mr. bennet; “but it is comfort to think that, whatever of
 that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will
 always make the most of it.”
 
mr. wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
 which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
 family. they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
 added that of general unreserve. the whole of what elizabeth had already
 heard, his claims on mr. darcy, and all that had suffered from him,
 was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
 pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they
 had known anything of the matter.
 
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
 extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of
 hertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
 allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else
 mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men.

chapter xxv.
 

[illustration]
 
after week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr.
 collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
 saturday. the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
 side by preparations for the reception of his bride, as had reason to
 hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day
 would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. took leave
 of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
 his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
 another letter of thanks.
 
on the following monday, mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
 brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the christmas at
 longbourn. mr. gardiner was sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
 superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. the netherfield
 ladies would have had difficulty in believing that man who lived by
 trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
 well-bred and agreeable. mrs. gardiner, who was several years younger
 than mrs. bennet and mrs. philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
 woman, and great favourite with her longbourn nieces. between the two
 eldest and herself especially, there subsisted very particular regard.
 they had frequently been staying with her in town.
 
the first part of mrs. gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to
 distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. when this was
 done, she had less active part to play. it became her turn to listen.
 mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. they
 had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. two of her
 girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
 in it.
 
“i do not blame jane,” she continued, “for jane would have got mr.
 bingley if she could. but, lizzy! oh, sister! it is very hard to think
 that she might have been mr. collins’s wife by this time, had not it
 been for her own perverseness. made her an offer in this very room,
 and she refused him. the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have
 daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as
 much entailed as ever. the lucases are very artful people, indeed,
 sister. they are all for what they can get. i am sorry to say it of
 them, but so it is. it makes very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
 so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
 before anybody else. however, your coming just at this time is the
 greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of
 long sleeves.”
 
mrs. gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
 the course of jane and elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her
 sister slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
 conversation.
 
when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.
 “it seems likely to have been desirable match for jane,” said she. “i
 am sorry it went off. but these things happen so often! young man,
 such as you describe mr. bingley, so easily falls in love with pretty
 girl for few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily
 forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”
 
[illustration:
 
“offended two or three young ladies”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“an excellent consolation in its way,” said elizabeth; “but it will not
 do for _us_. we do not suffer by accident. it does not often happen
 that the interference of friends will persuade young man of
 independent fortune to think more of girl whom was violently in
 love with only few days before.”
 
“but that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so
 doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives very little idea. it is as
 often applied to feelings which arise only from half hour’s
 acquaintance, as to real, strong attachment. pray, how _violent was_
 mr. bingley’s love?”
 
“i never saw more promising inclination; was growing quite
 inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. every time
 they met, it was more decided and remarkable. at his own ball he
 offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and i
 spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. could there be
 finer symptoms? is not general incivility the very essence of love?”
 
“oh, yes! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt. poor
 jane! i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
 over it immediately. it had better have happened to _you_, lizzy; you
 would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. but do you think she would
 be prevailed on to go back with us? change of scene might be of
 service--and perhaps little relief from home may be as useful as
 anything.”
 
elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
 of her sister’s ready acquiescence.
 
“i hope,” added mrs. gardiner, “that consideration with regard to
 this young man will influence her. we live in so different part of
 town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
 out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
 unless really comes to see her.”
 
“and _that_ is quite impossible; for is now in the custody of his
 friend, and mr. darcy would more suffer him to call on jane in such a
 part of london! my dear aunt, how could you think of it? mr. darcy may,
 perhaps, have _heard_ of such place as gracechurch street, but he
 would hardly think month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
 impurities, were once to enter it; and, depend upon it, mr. bingley
 never stirs without him.”
 
“so much the better. i hope they will not meet at all. but does not jane
 correspond with his sister? _she_ will not be able to help calling.”
 
“she will drop the acquaintance entirely.”
 
but, in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
 point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley’s being
 withheld from seeing jane, she felt solicitude on the subject which
 convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
 hopeless. it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
 his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
 successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane’s
 attractions.
 
miss bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the
 bingleys were otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she
 hoped, by caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she
 might occasionally spend morning with her, without any danger of
 seeing him.
 
the gardiners stayed week at longbourn; and what with the philipses,
 the lucases, and the officers, there was not day without its
 engagement. mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
 of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to family
 dinner. when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
 made part of it, of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one; and
 on these occasions mrs. gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth’s
 warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. without supposing
 them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
 of each other was plain enough to make her little uneasy; and she
 resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
 hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
 an attachment.
 
to mrs. gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
 unconnected with his general powers. about ten or dozen years ago,
 before her marriage, she had spent considerable time in that very part
 of derbyshire to which belonged. they had, therefore, many
 acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since
 the death of darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power
 to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been
 in the way of procuring.
 
mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr. darcy by
 character perfectly well. here, consequently, was an inexhaustible
 subject of discourse. in comparing her recollection of pemberley with
 the minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her
 tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
 delighting both him and herself. on being made acquainted with the
 present mr. darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
 that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite lad, which might
 agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having
 heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as very proud,
 ill-natured boy.

“will you come and see me?”

chapter xxvi.
 

[illustration]
 
mrs. gardiner’s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
 the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after
 honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--
 
“you are too sensible girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
 are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking
 openly. seriously, i would have you be on your guard. do not involve
 yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of
 fortune would make so very imprudent. i have nothing to say against
 _him_: is most interesting young man; and if had the fortune he
 ought to have, i should think you could not do better. but as it is--you
 must not let your fancy run away with you. you have sense, and we all
 expect you to use it. your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
 good conduct, i am sure. you must not disappoint your father.”
 
“my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”
 
“yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”
 
“well, then, you need not be under any alarm. i will take care of
 myself, and of mr. wickham too. shall not be in love with me, if i
 can prevent it.”
 
“elizabeth, you are not serious now.”
 
“i beg your pardon. i will try again. at present i am not in love with
 mr. wickham; no, i certainly am not. but is, beyond all comparison,
 the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if becomes really attached to
 me--i believe it will be better that should not. i see the imprudence
 of it. oh, _that_ abominable mr. darcy! my father’s opinion of does
 the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it. my
 father, however, is partial to mr. wickham. in short, my dear aunt, i
 should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
 since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are
 seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
 engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many
 of my fellow-creatures, if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that
 it would be wiser to resist? all that i can promise you, therefore, is
 not to be in hurry. i will not be in hurry to believe myself his
 first object. when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing. in
 short, i will do my best.”
 
“perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
 often. at least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”
 
“as i did the other day,” said elizabeth, with conscious smile; “very
 true, it will be wise in to refrain from _that_. but do not imagine
 that is always here so often. it is on your account that has been
 so frequently invited this week. you know my mother’s ideas as to the
 necessity of constant company for her friends. but really, and upon my
 honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now i hope you
 are satisfied.”
 
her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth, having thanked her for
 the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice
 being given on such point without being resented.
 
mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
 by the gardiners and jane; but, as took up his abode with the
 lucases, his arrival was great inconvenience to mrs. bennet. his
 marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned
 as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured
 tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” thursday was to be the
 wedding-day, and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and
 when she rose to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s
 ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,
 accompanied her out of the room. as they went down stairs together,
 charlotte said,--
 
“i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza.”
 
“_that_ you certainly shall.”
 
“and i have another favour to ask. will you come and see me?”
 
“we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire.”
 
“i am not likely to leave kent for some time. promise me, therefore, to
 come to hunsford.”
 
elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
 visit.
 
“my father and maria are to come to in march,” added charlotte, “and
 i hope you will consent to be of the party. indeed, eliza, you will be
 as welcome to as either of them.”
 
the wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
 the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the
 subject as usual. elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their
 correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it
 should be equally unreserved was impossible. elizabeth could never
 address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;
 and, though determined not to slacken as correspondent, it was for the
 sake of what had been rather than what was. charlotte’s first letters
 were received with good deal of eagerness: there could not but be
 curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
 like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
 be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte
 expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. she
 wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
 which she could not praise. the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
 roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine’s behaviour was most
 friendly and obliging. it was mr. collins’s picture of hunsford and
 rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
 for her own visit there, to know the rest.
 
jane had already written few lines to her sister, to announce their
 safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it
 would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.
 
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
 generally is. jane had been week in town, without either seeing or
 hearing from caroline. she accounted for it, however, by supposing that
 her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been
 lost.
 
“my aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the
 town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street.”
 
she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.
 “i did not think caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very
 glad to see me, and reproached for giving her notice of my coming
 to london. i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.
 i inquired after their brother, of course. was well, but so much
 engaged with mr. darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. i found that
 miss darcy was expected to dinner: i wish i could see her. my visit was
 not long, as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out. i dare say i shall
 soon see them here.”
 
elizabeth shook her head over this letter. it convinced her that
 accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sister’s being in town.
 
four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him. she endeavoured to
 persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could longer be
 blind to miss bingley’s inattention. after waiting at home every morning
 for fortnight, and inventing every evening fresh excuse for her, the
 visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet
 more, the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself
 longer. the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister
 will prove what she felt:--
 
“my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
 her better judgment, at my expense, when i confess myself to have
 been entirely deceived in miss bingley’s regard for me. but, my
 dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
 obstinate if i still assert that, considering what her behaviour
 was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. i do not at
 all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,
 if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should
 be deceived again. caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
 and not note, not line, did i receive in the meantime. when she
 did come, it was very evident that she had pleasure in it; she
 made slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a
 word of wishing to see again, and was, in every respect, so
 altered creature, that when she went away i was perfectly
 resolved to continue the acquaintance longer. i pity, though i
 cannot help blaming, her. she was very wrong in singling out as
 she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
 her side. but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been
 acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her
 brother is the cause of it. i need not explain myself farther; and
 though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
 feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
 deservedly dear as is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
 feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. i cannot but wonder,
 however, at her having any such fears now, because if had at all
 cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. knows of my
 being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and
 yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
 persuade herself that is really partial to miss darcy. i cannot
 understand it. if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should be
 almost tempted to say, that there is strong appearance of
 duplicity in all this. i will endeavour to banish every painful
 thought, and think only of what will make happy, your affection,
 and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. let hear
 from you very soon. miss bingley said something of his never
 returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
 with any certainty. we had better not mention it. i am extremely
 glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
 hunsford. pray go to see them, with sir william and maria. i am
 sure you will be very comfortable there.
 
“yours, etc.”
 
this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she
 considered that jane would longer be duped, by the sister at least.
 all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. she would not
 even wish for any renewal of his attentions. his character sunk on every
 review of it; and, as punishment for him, as well as possible
 advantage to jane, she seriously hoped might really soon marry mr.
 darcy’s sister, as, by wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly
 regret what had thrown away.
 
mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
 concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had
 such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
 herself. his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
 was the admirer of some one else. elizabeth was watchful enough to
 see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
 her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
 with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
 permitted it. the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
 remarkable charm of the young lady to whom was now rendering himself
 agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
 in charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
 nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to
 suppose that it cost him few struggles to relinquish her, she was
 ready to allow it wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
 sincerely wish him happy.
 
all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner; and, after relating the
 circumstances, she thus went on:--“i am now convinced, my dear aunt,
 that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that
 pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name,
 and wish him all manner of evil. but my feelings are not only cordial
 towards _him_, they are even impartial towards miss king. i cannot find
 out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think
 her very good sort of girl. there can be love in all this. my
 watchfulness has been effectual; and though i should certainly be more
 interesting object to all my acquaintance, were i distractedly in love
 with him, i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance.
 importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. kitty and lydia take
 his defection much more to heart than i do. they are young in the ways
 of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
 handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the
 plain.”

with greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise
 diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and
 sometimes cold, did january and february pass away. march was to take
 elizabeth to hunsford. she had not at first thought very seriously of
 going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the
 plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater
 pleasure as well as greater certainty. absence had increased her desire
 of seeing charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr. collins.
 there was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such mother and such
 uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, little change
 was not unwelcome for its own sake. the journey would, moreover, give
 her peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
 been very sorry for any delay. everything, however, went on smoothly,
 and was finally settled according to charlotte’s first sketch. she was
 to accompany sir william and his second daughter. the improvement of
 spending night in london was added in time, and the plan became as
 perfect as plan could be.
 
the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
 and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
 told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
 
the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly; on
 his side even more. his present pursuit could not make him forget that
 elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
 first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
 of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
 she was to expect in lady catherine bourgh, and trusting their
 opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
 was solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to
 him with most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,
 whether married or single, must always be her model of the amiable
 and pleasing.
 
her fellow-travellers the next day were not of kind to make her think
 him less agreeable. sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a
 good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
 that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
 delight as the rattle of the chaise. elizabeth loved absurdities, but
 she had known sir william’s too long. could tell her nothing new of
 the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
 worn out, like his information.
 
it was journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
 as to be in gracechurch street by noon. as they drove to mr. gardiner’s
 door, jane was at drawing-room window watching their arrival: when
 they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth,
 looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
 lovely as ever. on the stairs were troop of little boys and girls,
 whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to
 wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
 for twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. all was joy and
 kindness. the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
 shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
 
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. their first subject was her
 sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
 her minute inquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her
 spirits, there were periods of dejection. it was reasonable, however, to
 hope that they would not continue long. mrs. gardiner gave her the
 particulars also of miss bingley’s visit in gracechurch street, and
 repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
 herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
 acquaintance.
 
mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham’s desertion, and
 complimented her on bearing it so well.
 
“but, my dear elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is miss king? i
 should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”
 
“pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
 between the mercenary and the prudent motive? where does discretion end,
 and avarice begin? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
 because it would be imprudent; and now, because is trying to get a
 girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that is
 mercenary.”
 
“if you will only tell what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know
 what to think.”
 
“she is very good kind of girl, i believe. i know harm of her.”
 
“but paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death
 made her mistress of this fortune?”
 
“no--why should he? if it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
 affections, because i had money, what occasion could there be for
 making love to girl whom did not care about, and who was equally
 poor?”
 
“but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so
 soon after this event.”
 
“a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
 decorums which other people may observe. if _she_ does not object to it,
 why should _we_?”
 
“_her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. it only shows her being
 deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”
 
“well,” cried elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _he_ shall be
 mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”
 
“no, lizzy, that is what i do _not_ choose. i should be sorry, you know,
 to think ill of young man who has lived so long in derbyshire.”
 
“oh, if that is all, i have very poor opinion of young men who live in
 derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
 much better. i am sick of them all. thank heaven! i am going to-morrow
 where i shall find man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
 neither manners nor sense to recommend him. stupid men are the only ones
 worth knowing, after all.”
 
“take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”
 
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
 unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
 tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
 
“we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said mrs.
 gardiner; “but perhaps, to the lakes.”
 
scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her
 acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “my dear, dear
 aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! you give me
 fresh life and vigour. adieu to disappointment and spleen. what are men
 to rocks and mountains? oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! and
 when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
 being able to give one accurate idea of anything. we _will_ know where
 we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. lakes, mountains,
 and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
 we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
 about its relative situation. let _our_ first effusions be less
 insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”

chapter xxviii.
 

[illustration]
 
every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to
 elizabeth; and her spirits were in state of enjoyment; for she had
 seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
 and the prospect of her northern tour was constant source of delight.
 
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in
 search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
 the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side. elizabeth
 smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
 
at length the parsonage was discernible. the garden sloping to the
 road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,
 everything declared they were arriving. mr. collins and charlotte
 appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which
 led by short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
 the whole party. in moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
 at the sight of each other. mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the
 liveliest pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
 coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. she saw
 instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:
 his formal civility was just what it had been; and detained her some
 minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
 family. they were then, with other delay than his pointing out the
 neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were
 in the parlour, welcomed them second time, with ostentatious
 formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s
 offers of refreshment.
 
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
 fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,
 and its furniture, addressed himself particularly to her, as if
 wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. but though
 everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
 by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,
 that she could have so cheerful an air with such companion. when mr.
 collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
 which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
 charlotte. once or twice she could discern faint blush; but in general
 charlotte wisely did not hear. after sitting long enough to admire
 every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the
 fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
 happened in london, mr. collins invited them to take stroll in the
 garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
 which attended himself. to work in his garden was one of his most
 respectable pleasures; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance
 with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
 owned she encouraged it as much as possible. here, leading the way
 through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
 interval to utter the praises asked for, every view was pointed out
 with minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. could number the
 fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
 the most distant clump. but of all the views which his garden, or which
 the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with
 the prospect of rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that
 bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. it was a
 handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.
 
from his garden, mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows;
 but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of white
 frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte
 took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
 probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s
 help. it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
 was fitted up and arranged with neatness and consistency, of which
 elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit. when mr. collins could be
 forgotten, there was really great air of comfort throughout, and by
 charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed must be often
 forgotten.
 
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country. it
 was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr. collins joining
 in, observed,--
 
“yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
 bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will
 be delighted with her. she is all affability and condescension, and i
 doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
 service is over. i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
 include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
 honours us during your stay here. her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
 charming. we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
 walk home. her ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. i
 _should_ say, one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”
 
“lady catherine is very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added
 charlotte, “and most attentive neighbour.”
 
“very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say. she is the sort of
 woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”
 
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and
 telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
 elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
 charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
 and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
 was all done very well. she had also to anticipate how her visit would
 pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious
 interruptions of mr. collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse
 with rosings. lively imagination soon settled it all.
 
about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
 for walk, sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
 confusion; and, after listening moment, she heard somebody running
 upstairs in violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. she opened
 the door, and met maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with
 agitation, cried out,--
 
[illustration:
 
“in conversation with the ladies”
 
[copyright 1894 by george allen.]]
 
“oh, my dear eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
 there is such sight to be seen! i will not tell you what it is. make
 haste, and come down this moment.”
 
elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more;
 and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest
 of this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in low phaeton at the
 garden gate.
 
“and is this all?” cried elizabeth. “i expected at least that the pigs
 were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
 daughter!”
 
“la! my dear,” said maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not lady
 catherine. the old lady is mrs. jenkinson, who lives with them. the
 other is miss bourgh. only look at her. she is quite little
 creature. who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”
 
“she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
 why does she not come in?”
 
“oh, charlotte says she hardly ever does. it is the greatest of favours
 when miss bourgh comes in.”
 
“i like her appearance,” said elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “she
 looks sickly and cross. yes, she will do for him very well. she will
 make him very proper wife.”
 
mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
 with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth’s high diversion, was
 stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
 before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss bourgh looked that
 way.
 
at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
 the others returned into the house. mr. collins sooner saw the two
 girls than began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
 charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
 to dine at rosings the next day.

chapter xxix.
 

[illustration]
 
mr. collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
 the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
 visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
 wife, was exactly what had wished for; and that an opportunity of
 doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady
 catherine’s condescension as knew not how to admire enough.
 
“i confess,” said he, “that i should not have been at all surprised by
 her ladyship’s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening
 at rosings. i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that
 it would happen. but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?
 who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine
 there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so
 immediately after your arrival?”
 
“i am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied sir william,
 “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
 my situation in life has allowed to acquire. about the court, such
 instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”
 
scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
 visit to rosings. mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what
 they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
 so splendid dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
 
when the ladies were separating for the toilette, said to
 elizabeth,--
 
“do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. lady
 catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
 becomes herself and daughter. i would advise you merely to put on
 whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is occasion
 for anything more. lady catherine will not think the worse of you for
 being simply dressed. she likes to have the distinction of rank
 preserved.”
 
while they were dressing, came two or three times to their different
 doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much
 objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. such formidable accounts of
 her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas,
 who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her
 introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
 to his presentation at st. james’s.
 
as the weather was fine, they had pleasant walk of about half mile
 across the park. every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
 elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
 raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
 slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
 house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
 cost sir lewis bourgh.
 
when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria’s alarm was every moment
 increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm.
 elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. she had heard nothing of lady
 catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
 miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she
 thought she could witness without trepidation.
 
from the entrance hall, of which mr. collins pointed out, with a
 rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
 the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine,
 her daughter, and mrs. jenkinson were sitting. her ladyship, with great
 condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs. collins had settled it
 with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was
 performed in proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
 which would have thought necessary.
 
in spite of having been at st. james’s, sir william was so completely
 awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that had but just courage
 enough to make very low bow, and take his seat without saying word;
 and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
 of her chair, not knowing which way to look. elizabeth found herself
 quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
 composedly. lady catherine was tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
 features, which might once have been handsome. her air was not
 conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
 visitors forget their inferior rank. she was not rendered formidable by
 silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative tone as
 marked her self-importance, and brought mr. wickham immediately to
 elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she
 believed lady catherine to be exactly what had represented.
 
when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
 she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy, she turned her eyes on the
 daughter, she could almost have joined in maria’s astonishment at her
 being so thin and so small. there was neither in figure nor face any
 likeness between the ladies. miss bourgh was pale and sickly: her
 features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
 little, except in low voice, to mrs. jenkinson, in whose appearance
 there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
 to what she said, and placing screen in the proper direction before
 her eyes.
 
after sitting few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
 admire the view, mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties,
 and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
 looking at in the summer.
 
the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
 and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised; and, as he
 had likewise foretold, took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
 her ladyship’s desire, and looked as if felt that life could furnish
 nothing greater. carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;
 and every dish was commended first by him, and then by sir william, who
 was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a
 manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear. but lady
 catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most
 gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved novelty
 to them. the party did not supply much conversation. elizabeth was ready
 to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between
 charlotte and miss bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
 listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not word to her all
 the dinnertime. mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how
 little miss bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and
 fearing she was indisposed. maria thought speaking out of the question,
 and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
 
when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
 done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any
 intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
 subject in so decisive manner as proved that she was not used to have
 her judgment controverted. she inquired into charlotte’s domestic
 concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her great deal of advice as
 to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
 regulated in so small family as hers, and instructed her as to the
 care of her cows and her poultry. elizabeth found that nothing was
 beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an
 occasion for dictating to others. in the intervals of her discourse with
 mrs. collins, she addressed variety of questions to maria and
 elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
 the least, and who, she observed to mrs. collins, was very genteel,
 pretty kind of girl. she asked her at different times how many sisters
 she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
 them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
 had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
 mother’s maiden name? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
 questions, but answered them very composedly. lady catherine then
 observed,--
 
“your father’s estate is entailed on mr. collins, i think? for your
 sake,” turning to charlotte, “i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no
 occasion for entailing estates from the female line. it was not thought
 necessary in sir lewis bourgh’s family. do you play and sing, miss
 bennet?”
 
“a little.”
 
“oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. our
 instrument is capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it
 some day. do your sisters play and sing?”
 
“one of them does.”
 
“why did not you all learn? you ought all to have learned. the miss
 webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. do
 you draw?”
 
“no, not at all.”
 
“what, none of you?”
 
“not one.”
 
“that is very strange. but i suppose you had opportunity. your mother
 should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”
 
“my mother would have objection, but my father hates london.”
 
“has your governess left you?”
 
“we never had any governess.”
 
“no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home
 without governess! i never heard of such thing. your mother must
 have been quite slave to your education.”
 
elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
 been the case.
 
“then who taught you? who attended to you? without governess, you must
 have been neglected.”
 
“compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as
 wished to learn never wanted the means. we were always encouraged to
 read, and had all the masters that were necessary. those who chose to be
 idle certainly might.”
 
“ay, doubt: but that is what governess will prevent; and if i had
 known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
 one. i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
 and regular instruction, and nobody but governess can give it. it is
 wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
 way. i am always glad to get young person well placed out. four nieces
 of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
 it was but the other day that i recommended another young person, who
 was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
 delighted with her. mrs. collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe’s
 calling yesterday to thank me? she finds miss pope treasure. ‘lady
 catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given treasure.’ are any of your
 younger sisters out, miss bennet?”
 
“yes, ma’am, all.”
 
“all! what, all five out at once? very odd! and you only the second. the
 younger ones out before the elder are married! your younger sisters must
 be very young?”
 
“yes, my youngest is not sixteen. perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
 in company. but really, ma’am, i think it would be very hard upon
 younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and
 amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
 marry early. the last born has as good right to the pleasures of youth
 as the first. and to be kept back on _such_ motive! i think it would
 not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”
 
“upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly
 for so young person. pray, what is your age?”
 
“with three younger sisters grown up,” replied elizabeth, smiling, “your
 ladyship can hardly expect to own it.”
 
lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving direct answer;
 and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
 dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
 
“you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not
 conceal your age.”
 
“i am not one-and-twenty.”
 
when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
 were placed. lady catherine, sir william, and mr. and mrs. collins sat
 down to quadrille; and as miss bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
 two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her
 party. their table was superlatively stupid. scarcely syllable was
 uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs. jenkinson
 expressed her fears of miss bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or
 having too much or too little light. great deal more passed at the
 other table. lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
 of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. mr. collins
 was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
 for every fish won, and apologizing if thought won too many.
 sir william did not say much. was storing his memory with anecdotes
 and noble names.
 
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
 the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to mrs. collins,
 gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. the party then gathered
 round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
 to have on the morrow. from these instructions they were summoned by the
 arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr.
 collins’s side, and as many bows on sir william’s, they departed. as
 soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her
 cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which,
 for charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. but
 her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by means
 satisfy mr. collins, and was very soon obliged to take her ladyship’s
 praise into his own hands.

chapter xxx.

sir william stayed only week at hunsford; but his visit was long
 enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,
 and of her possessing such husband and such neighbour as were not
 often met with. while sir william was with them, mr. collins devoted his
 mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but
 when went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
 and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
 cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast
 and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in
 reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,
 which fronted the road. the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
 the dining parlour for common use; it was better sized room, and had a
 pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
 reason for what she did, for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been
 much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and
 she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.
 
from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
 were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
 along, and how often especially miss bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
 which never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
 almost every day. she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had
 few minutes’ conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever
 prevailed on to get out.
 
very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings, and
 not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
 and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
 to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
 hours. now and then they were honoured with call from her ladyship,
 and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
 these visits. she examined into their employments, looked at their work,
 and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
 of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
 accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
 out that mrs. collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.
 
elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the
 commission of the peace for the county, she was most active magistrate
 in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
 mr. collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
 quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
 village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
 them into harmony and plenty.

“he never failed to inform them”

the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice week;
 and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one
 card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
 of the first. their other engagements were few, as the style of living
 of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses’ reach. this,
 however, was evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
 comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
 charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
 had often great enjoyment out of doors. her favourite walk, and where
 she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was
 along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
 nice sheltered path, which one seemed to value but herself, and
 where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine’s curiosity.
 
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
 easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
 addition to the family at rosings, which in so small circle must be
 important. elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that mr. darcy
 was expected there in the course of few weeks; and though there were
 not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
 furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and
 she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley’s designs on him
 were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom was evidently destined
 by lady catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
 satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
 seemed almost angry to find that had already been frequently seen by
 miss lucas and herself.
 
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage; for mr. collins was walking
 the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane,
 in order to have
 
[illustration:
 
“the gentlemen accompanied him.”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage
 turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. on the
 following morning hastened to rosings to pay his respects. there were
 two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for mr. darcy had brought
 with him colonel fitzwilliam, the younger of his uncle, lord ----;
 and, to the great surprise of all the party, when mr. collins returned,
 the gentlemen accompanied him. charlotte had seen them from her
 husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the
 other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--
 
“i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility. mr. darcy would
 never have come so soon to wait upon me.”
 
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment
 before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
 afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. colonel fitzwilliam,
 who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
 address most truly the gentleman. mr. darcy looked just as had been
 used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
 reserve, to mrs. collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
 friend, met her with every appearance of composure. elizabeth merely
 courtesied to him, without saying word.
 
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the
 readiness and ease of well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
 his cousin, after having addressed slight observation on the house and
 garden to mrs. collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
 at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
 elizabeth after the health of her family. she answered him in the usual
 way; and, after moment’s pause, added,--
 
“my eldest sister has been in town these three months. have you never
 happened to see her there?”
 
she was perfectly sensible that never had: but she wished to see
 whether would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
 bingleys and jane; and she thought looked little confused as he
 answered that had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet. the
 subject was pursued further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
 away.

chapter xxxi.

colonel fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
 and the ladies all felt that must add considerably to the pleasure of
 their engagements at rosings. it was some days, however, before they
 received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
 house they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day,
 almost week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by
 such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
 come there in the evening. for the last week they had seen very little
 of either lady catherine or her daughter. colonel fitzwilliam had called
 at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr. darcy they had
 only seen at church.
 
the invitation was accepted, of course, and at proper hour they joined
 the party in lady catherine’s drawing-room. her ladyship received them
 civilly, but it was plain that their company was by means so
 acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
 almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy,
 much more than to any other person in the room.
 
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a
 welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs. collins’s pretty friend had,
 moreover, caught his fancy very much. now seated himself by her, and
 talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
 at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so
 well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
 spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as
 well as of mr. darcy. _his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
 towards them with look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a
 while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
 scruple to call out,--
 
“what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam? what is it you are talking
 of? what are you telling miss bennet? let hear what it is.”
 
“we were talking of music, madam,” said he, when longer able to avoid
 reply.
 
“of music! then pray speak aloud. it is of all subjects my delight. i
 must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.
 there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true
 enjoyment of music than myself, or better natural taste. if i had ever
 learnt, i should have been great proficient. and so would anne, if her
 health had allowed her to apply. i am confident that she would have
 performed delightfully. how does georgiana get on, darcy?”
 
mr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.
 
“i am very glad to hear such good account of her,” said lady
 catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
 if she does not practise great deal.”
 
“i assure you, madam,” replied, “that she does not need such advice.
 she practises very constantly.”
 
“so much the better. it cannot be done too much; and when i next write
 to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. i often
 tell young ladies, that excellence in music is to be acquired without
 constant practice. i have told miss bennet several times, that she will
 never play really well, unless she practises more; and though mrs.
 collins has instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often told
 her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in mrs.
 jenkinson’s room. she would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part
 of the house.”
 
mr. darcy looked little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made
 answer.
 
when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
 promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. he
 drew chair near her. lady catherine listened to half song, and then
 talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
 her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,
 stationed himself so as to command full view of the fair performer’s
 countenance. elizabeth saw what was doing, and at the first
 convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--
 
“you mean to frighten me, mr. darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
 me. but i will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.
 there is stubbornness about that never can bear to be frightened at
 the will of others. my courage always rises with every attempt to
 intimidate me.”
 
“i shall not say that you are mistaken,” replied, “because you could
 not really believe to entertain any design of alarming you; and i
 have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
 find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,
 are not your own.”
 
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
 colonel fitzwilliam, “your cousin will give you very pretty notion of
 me, and teach you not to believe word i say. i am particularly unlucky
 in meeting with person so well able to expose my real character, in a
 part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
 of credit. indeed, mr. darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
 all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me
 leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking to retaliate,
 and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”
 
“i am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.
 
“pray let hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried colonel
 fitzwilliam. “i should like to know how behaves among strangers.”
 
“you shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. the
 first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know, was at
 ball--and at this ball, what do you think did? danced only four
 dances! i am sorry to pain you, but so it was. danced only four
 dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more
 than one young lady was sitting down in want of partner. mr. darcy,
 you cannot deny the fact.”
 
“i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
 beyond my own party.”
 
“true; and nobody can ever be introduced in ball-room. well, colonel
 fitzwilliam, what do i play next? my fingers wait your orders.”
 
“perhaps,” said darcy, “i should have judged better had i sought an
 introduction, but i am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”
 
“shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said elizabeth, still
 addressing colonel fitzwilliam. “shall we ask him why man of sense and
 education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend
 himself to strangers?”
 
“i can answer your question,” said fitzwilliam, “without applying to
 him. it is because will not give himself the trouble.”
 
“i certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said darcy,
 “of conversing easily with those i have never seen before. i cannot
 catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
 concerns, as i often see done.”
 
“my fingers,” said elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the
 masterly manner which i see so many women’s do. they have not the same
 force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. but then i
 have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take
 the trouble of practising. it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers
 as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”
 
darcy smiled and said, “you are perfectly right. you have employed your
 time much better. one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
 think anything wanting. we neither of us perform to strangers.”
 
here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know
 what they were talking of. elizabeth immediately began playing again.
 lady catherine approached, and, after listening for few minutes, said
 to darcy,--
 
“miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
 could have the advantage of london master. she has very good notion
 of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne’s. anne would have
 been delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”
 
elizabeth looked at darcy, to see how cordially assented to his
 cousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
 discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
 bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that might have
 been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.
 
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth’s performance, mixing
 with them many instructions on execution and taste. elizabeth received
 them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
 gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship’s carriage was
 ready to take them all home.

chapter xxxii.
 

[illustration]
 
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane,
 while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village,
 when she was startled by ring at the door, the certain signal of a
 visitor. as she had heard carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
 lady catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her
 half-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,
 when the door opened, and to her very great surprise mr. darcy, and mr.
 darcy only, entered the room.
 
seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his
 intrusion, by letting her know that had understood all the ladies to
 be within.
 
they then sat down, and when her inquiries after rosings were made,
 seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. it was absolutely
 necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency
 recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling
 curious to know what would say on the subject of their hasty
 departure, she observed,--
 
“how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr. darcy!
 it must have been most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you
 all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, went but the day
 before. and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london?”
 
“perfectly so, i thank you.”
 
she found that she was to receive other answer; and, after short
 pause, added,--
 
“i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever
 returning to netherfield again?”
 
“i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that may spend
 very little of his time there in future. has many friends, and is
 at time of life when friends and engagements are continually
 increasing.”
 
“if means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the
 neighbourhood that should give up the place entirely, for then we
 might possibly get settled family there. but, perhaps, mr. bingley did
 not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
 for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
 principle.”
 
“i should not be surprised,” said darcy, “if were to give it up as
 soon as any eligible purchase offers.”
 
elizabeth made answer. she was afraid of talking longer of his
 friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
 trouble of finding subject to him.
 
took the hint and soon began with, “this seems very comfortable
 house. lady catherine, i believe, did great deal to it when mr.
 collins first came to hunsford.”
 
“i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her
 kindness on more grateful object.”
 
“mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of wife.”
 
“yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
 the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
 him happy if they had. my friend has an excellent understanding--though
 i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest
 thing she ever did. she seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a
 prudential light, it is certainly very good match for her.”
 
“it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
 distance of her own family and friends.”
 
“an easy distance do you call it? it is nearly fifty miles.”
 
“and what is fifty miles of good road? little more than half day’s
 journey. yes, i call it very easy distance.”
 
“i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
 of the match,” cried elizabeth. “i should never have said mrs. collins
 was settled _near_ her family.”
 
“it is proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire. anything beyond
 the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far.”
 
as spoke there was sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she
 understood; must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
 netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--
 
“i do not mean to say that woman may not be settled too near her
 family. the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
 varying circumstances. where there is fortune to make the expense of
 travelling unimportant, distance becomes evil. but that is not the
 case _here_. mr. and mrs. collins have comfortable income, but not
 such one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my
 friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
 the present distance.”
 
mr. darcy drew his chair little towards her, and said, “_you_ cannot
 have right to such very strong local attachment. _you_ cannot have
 been always at longbourn.”
 
elizabeth looked surprised. the gentleman experienced some change of
 feeling; drew back his chair, took newspaper from the table, and,
 glancing over it, said, in colder voice,--
 
“are you pleased with kent?”
 
short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
 calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
 and her sister, just returned from their walk. the _tête-à-tête_
 surprised them. mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his
 intruding on miss bennet, and, after sitting few minutes longer,
 without saying much to anybody, went away.
 
[illustration: “accompanied by their aunt”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“what can be the meaning of this?” said charlotte, as soon as was
 gone. “my dear eliza, must be in love with you, or would never
 have called on us in this familiar way.”
 
but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
 even to charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various
 conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
 the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
 from the time of year. all field sports were over. within doors there
 was lady catherine, books, and billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
 always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the
 pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
 two cousins found temptation from this period of walking thither
 almost every day. they called at various times of the morning, sometimes
 separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
 aunt. it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
 had pleasure in their society, persuasion which of course recommended
 him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
 being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former
 favourite, george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there
 was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam’s manners, she
 believed might have the best informed mind.
 
but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult
 to understand. it could not be for society, as frequently sat there
 ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when did speak, it
 seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
 propriety, not pleasure to himself. seldom appeared really
 animated. mrs. collins knew not what to make of him. colonel
 fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that was
 generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
 her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
 love, and the object of that love her friend eliza, she set herself
 seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at
 rosings, and whenever came to hunsford; but without much success. he
 certainly looked at her friend great deal, but the expression of that
 look was disputable. it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
 doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
 seemed nothing but absence of mind.
 
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
 being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs.
 collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
 raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
 opinion it admitted not of doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would
 vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.
 
in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
 colonel fitzwilliam. was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he
 certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
 to counterbalance these advantages, mr. darcy had considerable patronage
 in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.

more than once did elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
 unexpectedly meet mr. darcy. she felt all the perverseness of the
 mischance that should bring him where one else was brought; and, to
 prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,
 that it was favourite haunt of hers. how it could occur second time,
 therefore, was very odd! yet it did, and even the third. it seemed like
 wilful ill-nature, or voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was
 not merely few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
 but actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. he
 never said great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
 or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
 encounter that was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her
 pleasure in being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
 opinion of mr. and mrs. collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of
 rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, seemed to
 expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying
 _there_ too. his words seemed to imply it. could have colonel
 fitzwilliam in his thoughts? she supposed, if meant anything, must
 mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. it distressed her
 little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
 pales opposite the parsonage.
 
she was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing jane’s last
 letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not
 written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy,
 she saw, on looking up, that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her.
 putting away the letter immediately, and forcing smile, she said,--
 
“i did not know before that you ever walked this way.”
 
“i have been making the tour of the park,” replied, “as i generally
 do every year, and intended to close it with call at the parsonage.
 are you going much farther?”
 
“no, i should have turned in moment.”
 
and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage
 together.
 
“do you certainly leave kent on saturday?” said she.
 
“yes--if darcy does not put it off again. but i am at his disposal. he
 arranges the business just as pleases.”
 
“and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, has at least
 great pleasure in the power of choice. i do not know anybody who seems
 more to enjoy the power of doing what likes than mr. darcy.”
 
“he likes to have his own way very well,” replied colonel fitzwilliam.
 “but so we all do. it is only that has better means of having it than
 many others, because is rich, and many others are poor. i speak
 feelingly. younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
 dependence.”
 
“in my opinion, the younger of an earl can know very little of
 either. now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
 dependence? when have you been prevented by want of money from going
 wherever you chose or procuring anything you had fancy for?”
 
“these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have
 experienced many hardships of that nature. but in matters of greater
 weight, i may suffer from the want of money. younger sons cannot marry
 where they like.”
 
“unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often
 do.”
 
“our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in
 my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
 money.”
 
“is this,” thought elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the
 idea; but, recovering herself, said in lively tone, “and pray, what is
 the usual price of an earl’s younger son? unless the elder brother is
 very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”
 
answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. to interrupt
 silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
 she soon afterwards said,--
 
“i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
 having somebody at his disposal. i wonder does not marry, to secure a
 lasting convenience of that kind. but, perhaps, his sister does as well
 for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, may do what he
 likes with her.”
 
“no,” said colonel fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which must
 divide with me. i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy.”
 
“are you, indeed? and pray what sort of guardian do you make? does
 your charge give you much trouble? young ladies of her age are sometimes
 little difficult to manage; and if she has the true darcy spirit, she
 may like to have her own way.”
 
as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
 in which immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
 give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
 got pretty near the truth. she directly replied,--
 
“you need not be frightened. i never heard any harm of her; and i dare
 say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. she is a
 very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs. hurst and
 miss bingley. i think i have heard you say that you know them.”
 
“i know them little. their brother is pleasant, gentlemanlike
 man--he is great friend of darcy’s.”
 
“oh yes,” said elizabeth drily--“mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr.
 bingley, and takes prodigious deal of care of him.”
 
“care of him! yes, i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in
 those points where most wants care. from something that told me
 in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted
 to him. but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have right to suppose
 that bingley was the person meant. it was all conjecture.”
 
“what is it you mean?”
 
“it is circumstance which darcy of course could not wish to be
 generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it
 would be an unpleasant thing.”
 
“you may depend upon my not mentioning it.”
 
“and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
 bingley. what told was merely this: that congratulated himself
 on having lately saved friend from the inconveniences of most
 imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
 particulars; and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him
 the kind of young man to get into scrape of that sort, and from
 knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”
 
“did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”
 
“i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
 lady.”
 
“and what arts did use to separate them?”
 
“he did not talk to of his own arts,” said fitzwilliam, smiling. “he
 only told what i have now told you.”
 
elizabeth made answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
 indignation. after watching her little, fitzwilliam asked her why she
 was so thoughtful.
 
“i am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “your
 cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. why was to be the
 judge?”
 
“you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”
 
“i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
 friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, was to
 determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. but,”
 she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the
 particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. it is not to be supposed
 that there was much affection in the case.”
 
“that is not an unnatural surmise,” said fitzwilliam; “but it is
 lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”
 
this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just picture of
 mr. darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
 therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
 matters till they reached the parsonage. there, shut into her own room,
 as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
 of all that she had heard. it was not to be supposed that any other
 people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. there
 could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom mr. darcy could have
 such boundless influence. that had been concerned in the measures
 taken to separate mr. bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she
 had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and
 arrangement of them. if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
 _he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that
 jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. had ruined for a
 while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
 in the world; and one could say how lasting an evil might have
 inflicted.
 
“there were some very strong objections against the lady,” were colonel
 fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her
 having one uncle who was country attorney, and another who was in
 business in london.
 
“to jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be possibility of
 objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! her understanding
 excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. neither could
 anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
 peculiarities, has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain,
 and respectability which will probably never reach.” when she thought
 of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way little; but she would
 not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr.
 darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive deeper wound from
 the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want
 of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that had been partly
 governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
 retaining mr. bingley for his sister.
 
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a
 headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
 her unwillingness to see mr. darcy, it determined her not to attend her
 cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. mrs. collins,
 seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
 as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but mr. collins
 could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine’s being rather
 displeased by her staying at home.

when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
 much as possible against mr. darcy, chose for her employment the
 examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
 being in kent. they contained actual complaint, nor was there any
 revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
 but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was want of that
 cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
 proceeding from the serenity of mind at ease with itself, and kindly
 disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. elizabeth
 noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
 attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. mr. darcy’s
 shameful boast of what misery had been able to inflict gave her a
 keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. it was some consolation to
 think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next,
 and still greater that in less than fortnight she should herself be
 with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
 spirits, by all that affection could do.
 
she could not think of darcy’s leaving kent without remembering that his
 cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
 that had intentions at all, and, agreeable as was, she did not
 mean to be unhappy about him.
 
while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
 door-bell; and her spirits were little fluttered by the idea of its
 being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
 the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. but
 this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
 affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr. darcy walk into the
 room. in hurried manner immediately began an inquiry after her
 health, imputing his visit to wish of hearing that she were better.
 she answered him with cold civility. sat down for few moments, and
 then getting up walked about the room. elizabeth was surprised, but
 said not word. after silence of several minutes, came towards her
 in an agitated manner, and thus began:--
 
“in vain have i struggled. it will not do. my feelings will not be
 repressed. you must allow to tell you how ardently i admire and love
 you.”
 
elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. she stared, coloured,
 doubted, and was silent. this considered sufficient encouragement,
 and the avowal of all that felt and had long felt for her immediately
 followed. spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the
 heart to be detailed, and was not more eloquent on the subject of
 tenderness than of pride. his sense of her inferiority, of its being a
 degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed
 to inclination, were dwelt on with warmth which seemed due to the
 consequence was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
 suit.
 
in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
 the compliment of such man’s affection, and though her intentions did
 not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain was to
 receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
 all compassion in anger. she tried, however, to compose herself to
 answer him with patience, when should have done. concluded with
 representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of
 all his endeavours had found impossible to conquer; and with
 expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
 his hand. as said this she could easily see that had doubt of a
 favourable answer. _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
 countenance expressed real security. such circumstance could only
 exasperate farther; and when ceased the colour rose into her cheeks
 and she said,--
 
“in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to
 express sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
 unequally they may be returned. it is natural that obligation should be
 felt, and if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you. but i
 cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
 bestowed it most unwillingly. i am sorry to have occasioned pain to
 anyone. it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be
 of short duration. the feelings which you tell have long prevented
 the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in
 overcoming it after this explanation.”
 
mr. darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed
 on her face, seemed to catch her words with less resentment than
 surprise. his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
 his mind was visible in every feature. was struggling for the
 appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till believed
 himself to have attained it. the pause was to elizabeth’s feelings
 dreadful. at length, in voice of forced calmness, said,--
 
“and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting! i
 might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
 civility, i am thus rejected. but it is of small importance.”
 
“i might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident design
 of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell that you liked me
 against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
 was not this some excuse for incivility, if i _was_ uncivil? but i have
 other provocations. you know i have. had not my own feelings decided
 against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
 favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt to accept
 the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
 happiness of most beloved sister?”
 
as she pronounced these words, mr. darcy changed colour; but the emotion
 was short, and listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
 continued,--
 
“i have every reason in the world to think ill of you. motive can
 excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. you dare not,
 you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
 of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
 world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
 disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
 kind.”
 
she paused, and saw with slight indignation that was listening
 with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
 even looked at her with smile of affected incredulity.
 
“can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.
 
with assumed tranquillity then replied, “i have wish of denying
 that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
 sister, or that i rejoice in my success. towards _him_ i have been
 kinder than towards myself.”
 
elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
 but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
 
“but it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike
 is founded. long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
 decided. your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
 many months ago from mr. wickham. on this subject, what can you have to
 say? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
 or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”
 
“you take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said darcy,
 in less tranquil tone, and with heightened colour.
 
“who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an
 interest in him?”
 
“his misfortunes!” repeated darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his
 misfortunes have been great indeed.”
 
“and of your infliction,” cried elizabeth, with energy; “you have
 reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. you
 have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed
 for him. you have deprived the best years of his life of that
 independence which was less his due than his desert. you have done
 all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with
 contempt and ridicule.”
 
“and this,” cried darcy, as walked with quick steps across the room,
 “is your opinion of me! this is the estimation in which you hold me! i
 thank you for explaining it so fully. my faults, according to this
 calculation, are heavy indeed! but, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his
 walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been
 overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
 scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. these
 bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i, with greater
 policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my
 being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
 reflection, by everything. but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
 nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related. they were natural and just.
 could you expect to rejoice in the inferiority of your
 connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose
 condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”
 
elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
 the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--
 
“you are mistaken, mr. darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
 declaration affected in any other way than as it spared the
 concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
 more gentlemanlike manner.”
 
she saw him start at this; but said nothing, and she continued,--
 
“you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way
 that would have tempted to accept it.”
 
again his astonishment was obvious; and looked at her with an
 expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. she went on,--
 
“from the very beginning, from the first moment, i may almost say, of my
 acquaintance with you, your manners impressing with the fullest
 belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
 feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of
 disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
 dislike; and i had not known you month before i felt that you were the
 last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry.”
 
“you have said quite enough, madam. i perfectly comprehend your
 feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
 forgive for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
 wishes for your health and happiness.”
 
and with these words hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him
 the next moment open the front door and quit the house. the tumult of
 her mind was now painfully great. she knew not how to support herself,
 and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. her
 astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by
 every review of it. that she should receive an offer of marriage from
 mr. darcy! that should have been in love with her for so many months!
 so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections
 which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which
 must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost
 incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong
 an affection. but his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal
 of what had done with respect to jane, his unpardonable assurance in
 acknowledging, though could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner
 which had mentioned mr. wickham, his cruelty towards whom had not
 attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his
 attachment had for moment excited.
 
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady
 catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
 charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.

chapter xxxv.
 

[illustration]
 
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
 which had at length closed her eyes. she could not yet recover from the
 surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything
 else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
 breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. she was proceeding
 directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr. darcy’s
 sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
 she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. the
 park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
 of the gates into the ground.
 
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
 tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
 look into the park. the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had
 made great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
 verdure of the early trees. she was on the point of continuing her
 walk, when she caught glimpse of gentleman within the sort of grove
 which edged the park: was moving that way; and fearful of its being
 mr. darcy, she was directly retreating. but the person who advanced was
 now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,
 pronounced her name. she had turned away; but on hearing herself called,
 though in voice which proved it to be mr. darcy, she moved again
 towards the gate. had by that time reached it also; and, holding out
 letter, which she instinctively took, said, with look of haughty
 composure, “i have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of
 meeting you. will you do the honour of reading that letter?” and
 then, with slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon
 out of sight.
 
with expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
 elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
 perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
 quite through, in very close hand. the envelope itself was likewise
 full. pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. it was dated
 from rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--
 
“be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of
 its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those
 offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. i write without any
 intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,
 which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
 effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
 should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
 and read. you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand
 your attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i
 demand it of your justice.
 
“two offences of very different nature, and by means of equal
 magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. the first mentioned was,
 that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached mr. bingley
 from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in defiance of various
 claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
 prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham. wilfully and
 wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
 favourite of my father, young man who had scarcely any other
 dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
 its exertion, would be depravity, to which the separation of two young
 persons whose affection could be the growth of only few weeks, could
 bear comparison. but from the severity of that blame which was last
 night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope
 to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and
 their motives has been read. if, in the explanation of them which is due
 to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be
 offensive to yours, i can only say that i am sorry. the necessity must
 be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. i had not been long in
 hertfordshire before i saw, in common with others, that bingley
 preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. but
 it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any
 apprehension of his feeling serious attachment. i had often seen him
 in love before. at that ball, while i had the honour of dancing with
 you, i was first made acquainted, by sir william lucas’s accidental
 information, that bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to
 general expectation of their marriage. spoke of it as certain
 event, of which the time alone could be undecided. from that moment i
 observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive
 that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed
 in him. your sister i also watched. her look and manners were open,
 cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar
 regard; and i remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that
 though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite
 them by any participation of sentiment. if _you_ have not been mistaken
 here, _i_ must have been in an error. your superior knowledge of your
 sister must make the latter probable. if it be so, if i have been misled
 by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
 unreasonable. but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of
 your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most
 acute observer conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart
 was not likely to be easily touched. that i was desirous of believing
 her indifferent is certain; but i will venture to say that my
 investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or
 fears. i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it; i
 believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason.
 my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night
 acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside
 in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
 my friend as to me. but there were other causes of repugnance; causes
 which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both
 instances, i had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not
 immediately before me. these causes must be stated, though briefly. the
 situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in
 comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost
 uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and
 occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains to offend
 you. but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,
 and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
 consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid
 any share of the like censure is praise less generally bestowed on
 you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and
 disposition of both. i will only say, farther, that from what passed
 that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every
 inducement heightened, which could have led before to preserve my
 friend from what i esteemed most unhappy connection. left
 netherfield for london on the day following, as you, i am certain,
 remember, with the design of soon returning. the part which i acted is
 now to be explained. his sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited
 with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike
 sensible that time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we
 shortly resolved on joining him directly in london. we accordingly
 went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my
 friend the certain evils of such choice. i described and enforced them
 earnestly. but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed
 his determination, i do not suppose that it would ultimately have
 prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which
 i hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. had before
 believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,
 regard. but bingley has great natural modesty, with stronger
 dependence on my judgment than on his own. to convince him, therefore,
 that had deceived himself was very difficult point. to persuade
 him against returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been
 given, was scarcely the work of moment. i cannot blame myself for
 having done thus much. there is but one part of my conduct, in the whole
 affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that i
 condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him
 your sister’s being in town. i knew it myself, as it was known to miss
 bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. that they might
 have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard
 did not appear to enough extinguished for him to see her without some
 danger. perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. it is
 done, however, and it was done for the best. on this subject i have
 nothing more to say, other apology to offer. if i have wounded your
 sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
 governed may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have not
 yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other, more weighty
 accusation, of having injured mr. wickham, i can only refute it by
 laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. of what he
 has _particularly_ accused i am ignorant; but of the truth of what i
 shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.
 mr. wickham is the of very respectable man, who had for many years
 the management of all the pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in
 the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service
 to him; and on george wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was
 therefore liberally bestowed. my father supported him at school, and
 afterwards at cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,
 always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to
 give him gentleman’s education. my father was not only fond of this
 young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, had also the
 highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,
 intended to provide for him in it. as for myself, it is many, many years
 since i first began to think of him in very different manner. the
 vicious propensities, the want of principle, which was careful to
 guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the
 observation of young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who
 had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr. darcy
 could not have. here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you
 only can tell. but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has
 created, suspicion of their nature shall not prevent from unfolding
 his real character. it adds even another motive. my excellent father
 died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the
 last so steady, that in his will particularly recommended it to to
 promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might
 allow, and if took orders, desired that valuable family living
 might be his as soon as it became vacant. there was also legacy of
 one thousand pounds. his own father did not long survive mine; and
 within half year from these events mr. wickham wrote to inform me
 that, having finally resolved against taking orders, hoped i should
 not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate
 pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which could not be
 benefited. had some intention, added, of studying the law, and i
 must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be very
 insufficient support therein. i rather wished than believed him to be
 sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his
 proposal. i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be clergyman. the
 business was therefore soon settled. resigned all claim to assistance
 in the church, were it possible that could ever be in situation to
 receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. all connection
 between us seemed now dissolved. i thought too ill of him to invite him
 to pemberley, or admit his society in town. in town, i believe, he
 chiefly lived, but his studying the law was mere pretence; and being
 now free from all restraint, his life was life of idleness and
 dissipation. for about three years i heard little of him; but on the
 decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,
 applied to again by letter for the presentation. his
 circumstances, assured me, and i had difficulty in believing it,
 were exceedingly bad. had found the law most unprofitable study,
 and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would present
 him to the living in question--of which trusted there could be little
 doubt, as was well assured that i had other person to provide for,
 and i could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. you will
 hardly blame for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
 resisting every repetition of it. his resentment was in proportion to
 the distress of his circumstances--and was doubtless as violent in
 his abuse of to others as in his reproaches to myself. after this
 period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. how lived, i
 know not. but last summer was again most painfully obtruded on my
 notice. i must now mention circumstance which i would wish to forget
 myself, and which obligation less than the present should induce me
 to unfold to any human being. having said thus much, i feel doubt of
 your secrecy. my sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left
 to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, colonel fitzwilliam, and
 myself. about year ago, she was taken from school, and an
 establishment formed for her in london; and last summer she went with
 the lady who presided over it to ramsgate; and thither also went mr.
 wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been prior
 acquaintance between him and mrs. younge, in whose character we were
 most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid so far
 recommended himself to georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a
 strong impression of his kindness to her as child, that she was
 persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. she
 was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
 imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to
 herself. i joined them unexpectedly day or two before the intended
 elopement; and then georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving
 and offending brother whom she almost looked up to as father,
 acknowledged the whole to me. you may imagine what i felt and how i
 acted. regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public
 exposure; but i wrote to mr. wickham, who left the place immediately,
 and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge. mr. wickham’s
 chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty
 thousand pounds; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging
 himself on was strong inducement. his revenge would have been
 complete indeed. this, madam, is faithful narrative of every event in
 which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely
 reject it as false, you will, i hope, acquit henceforth of cruelty
 towards mr. wickham. i know not in what manner, under what form of
 falsehood, has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be
 wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning
 either. detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly
 not in your inclination. you may possibly wonder why all this was not
 told you last night. but i was not then master enough of myself to know
 what could or ought to be revealed. for the truth of everything here
 related, i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel
 fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and
 still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been
 unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. if
 your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you
 cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and
 that there may be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour
 to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the
 course of the morning. i will only add, god bless you.
 
“fitzwilliam darcy.”

chapter xxxvi.

elizabeth, when mr. darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
 contain renewal of his offers, she had formed expectation at all of
 its contents. but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
 she went through them, and what contrariety of emotion they excited.
 her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. with amazement did
 she first understand that believed any apology to be in his power;
 and steadfastly was she persuaded, that could have explanation to
 give, which just sense of shame would not conceal. with strong
 prejudice against everything might say, she began his account of
 what had happened at netherfield. she read with an eagerness which
 hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing
 what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
 sense of the one before her eyes. his belief of her sister’s
 insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the
 real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any
 wish of doing him justice. expressed regret for what had done
 which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. it was all
 pride and insolence.
 
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham--when
 she read, with somewhat clearer attention, relation of events which,
 if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
 bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings
 were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
 astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. she wished
 to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “this must be false!
 this cannot be! this must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had
 gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
 last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
 regard it, that she would never look in it again.
 
in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
 nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half minute the letter
 was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she
 again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and
 commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
 the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly
 what had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy,
 though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
 own words. so far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to
 the will, the difference was great. what wickham had said of the living
 was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was
 impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
 other, and, for few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
 not err. but when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the
 particulars immediately following of wickham’s resigning all pretensions
 to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable sum as three
 thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. she put down the
 letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
 impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
 little success. on both sides it was only assertion. again she read on.
 but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
 believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
 render mr. darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
 turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.
 
the extravagance and general profligacy which scrupled not to lay to
 mr. wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
 bring proof of its injustice. she had never heard of him before his
 entrance into the ----shire militia, in which had engaged at the
 persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
 had there renewed slight acquaintance. of his former way of life,
 nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what told
 
[illustration:

himself. as to his real character, had information been in her power,
 she had never felt wish of inquiring. his countenance, voice, and
 manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.
 she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished
 trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the
 attacks of mr. darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone
 for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what
 mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’
 continuance. but such recollection befriended her. she could see him
 instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could
 remember more substantial good than the general approbation of the
 neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in
 the mess. after pausing on this point considerable while, she once
 more continued to read. but, alas! the story which followed, of his
 designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed
 between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at
 last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel
 fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the
 information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose
 character she had reason to question. at one time she had almost
 resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness
 of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that
 mr. darcy would never have hazarded such proposal, if had not been
 well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.
 
she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
 between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr. philips’s.
 many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. she was _now_
 struck with the impropriety of such communications to stranger, and
 wondered it had escaped her before. she saw the indelicacy of putting
 himself forward as had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
 with his conduct. she remembered that had boasted of having fear
 of seeing mr. darcy--that mr. darcy might leave the country, but that
 _he_ should stand his ground; yet had avoided the netherfield ball
 the very next week. she remembered, also, that till the netherfield
 family had quitted the country, had told his story to one but
 herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;
 that had then reserves, scruples in sinking mr. darcy’s
 character, though had assured her that respect for the father would
 always prevent his exposing the son.
 
how differently did everything now appear in which was concerned! his
 attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
 hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved longer
 the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
 his behaviour to herself could now have had tolerable motive: had
 either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
 his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
 incautiously shown. every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
 and fainter; and in further justification of mr. darcy, she could not
 but allow that mr. bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago
 asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as
 were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
 acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
 together, and given her sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
 that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
 of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections was
 esteemed and valued;--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a
 brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
 sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his
 actions been what wickham represented them, so gross violation of
 everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
 that friendship between person capable of it and such an amiable man
 as mr. bingley was incomprehensible.
 
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself. of neither darcy nor wickham
 could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
 prejudiced, absurd.
 
“how despicably have i acted!” she cried. “i, who have prided myself on
 my discernment! i, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
 often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
 vanity in useless or blameless distrust. how humiliating is this
 discovery! yet, how just humiliation! had i been in love, i could not
 have been more wretchedly blind. but vanity, not love, has been my
 folly. pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
 of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted
 prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were
 concerned. till this moment, i never knew myself.”
 
from herself to jane, from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in line
 which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy’s explanation
 _there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. widely
 different was the effect of second perusal. how could she deny that
 credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
 give in the other? declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious
 of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what
 charlotte’s opinion had always been. neither could she deny the justice
 of his description of jane. she felt that jane’s feelings, though
 fervent, were little displayed, and that there was constant
 complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
 sensibility.
 
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
 mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense
 of shame was severe. the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
 for denial; and the circumstances to which particularly alluded, as
 having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
 disapprobation, could not have made stronger impression on his mind
 than on hers.
 
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. it soothed, but
 it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
 self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that
 jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest
 relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
 by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
 had ever known before.
 
after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
 variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and
 reconciling herself, as well as she could, to change so sudden and so
 important, fatigue, and recollection of her long absence, made her at
 length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing
 cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as
 must make her unfit for conversation.
 
she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
 called during her absence; mr. darcy, only for few minutes, to take
 leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
 an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
 till she could be found. elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
 missing him; she really rejoiced at it. colonel fitzwilliam was no
 longer an object. she could think only of her letter.
 



[illustration:
 
“his parting obeisance”
 ]
 



chapter xxxvii.
 

[illustration]
 
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr. collins having
 been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
 able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very
 good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
 melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings. to rosings then
 hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter; and on his return
 brought back, with great satisfaction, message from her ladyship,
 importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
 having them all to dine with her.
 
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that, had
 she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her
 future niece; nor could she think, without smile, of what her
 ladyship’s indignation would have been. “what would she have said? how
 would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused
 herself.
 
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings’ party. “i assure
 you, i feel it exceedingly,” said lady catherine; “i believe nobody
 feels the loss of friends so much as i do. but i am particularly
 attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!
 they were excessively sorry to go! but so they always are. the dear
 colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy
 seemed to feel it most acutely--more, i think, than last year. his
 attachment to rosings certainly increases.”
 
mr. collins had compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which
 were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
 
lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of
 spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
 she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--
 
“but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
 may stay little longer. mrs. collins will be very glad of your
 company, i am sure.”
 
“i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied
 elizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. i must be in town
 next saturday.”
 
“why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. i expected
 you to stay two months. i told mrs. collins so before you came. there
 can be occasion for your going so soon. mrs. bennet could certainly
 spare you for another fortnight.”
 
“but my father cannot. wrote last week to hurry my return.”
 
[illustration:
 
“dawson”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.
 daughters are never of so much consequence to father. and if you will
 stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you
 as far as london, for i am going there early in june, for week; and
 as dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good
 room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be
 cool, i should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you
 large.”
 
“you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our
 original plan.”
 
lady catherine seemed resigned. “mrs. collins, you must send servant
 with them. you know i always speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea
 of two young women travelling post by themselves. it is highly improper.
 you must contrive to send somebody. i have the greatest dislike in the
 world to that sort of thing. young women should always be properly
 guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. when my
 niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made point of her
 having two men-servants go with her. miss darcy, the daughter of mr.
 darcy of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with
 propriety in different manner. i am excessively attentive to all those
 things. you must send john with the young ladies, mrs. collins. i am
 glad it occurred to to mention it; for it would really be
 discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”
 
“my uncle is to send servant for us.”
 
“oh! your uncle! keeps man-servant, does he? i am very glad you
 have somebody who thinks of those things. where shall you change horses?
 oh, bromley, of course. if you mention my name at the bell, you will be
 attended to.”
 
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;
 and as she did not answer them all herself attention was
 necessary--which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a
 mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. reflection
 must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave
 way to it as the greatest relief; and not day went by without a
 solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of
 unpleasant recollections.
 
mr. darcy’s letter she was in fair way of soon knowing by heart. she
 studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
 times widely different. when she remembered the style of his address,
 she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly
 she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
 herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
 his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she
 could not approve him; nor could she for moment repent her refusal, or
 feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. in her own past
 behaviour, there was constant source of vexation and regret: and in
 the unhappy defects of her family, subject of yet heavier chagrin.
 they were hopeless of remedy. her father, contented with laughing at
 them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
 youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
 herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. elizabeth had frequently
 united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
 and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,
 what chance could there be of improvement? catherine, weak-spirited,
 irritable, and completely under lydia’s guidance, had been always
 affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would
 scarcely give them hearing. they were ignorant, idle, and vain. while
 there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
 meryton was within walk of longbourn, they would be going there for
 ever.
 
anxiety on jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and mr. darcy’s
 explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion,
 heightened the sense of what jane had lost. his affection was proved to
 have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
 could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. how
 grievous then was the thought that, of situation so desirable in every
 respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had
 been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
 
when to these recollections was added the development of wickham’s
 character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
 seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it
 almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
 
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
 her stay as they had been at first. the very last evening was spent
 there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
 their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
 and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
 way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
 work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
 
when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them
 good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year;
 and miss bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out
 her hand to both.

“the elevation of his feelings.”

chapter xxxviii.
 

[illustration]
 
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast few
 minutes before the others appeared; and took the opportunity of
 paying the parting civilities which deemed indispensably necessary.
 
“i know not, miss elizabeth,” said he, “whether mrs. collins has yet
 expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but i am very
 certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
 it. the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you. we know
 how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. our plain
 manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
 see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to young lady like
 yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
 and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending
 your time unpleasantly.”
 
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. she had
 spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
 charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel
 the obliged. mr. collins was gratified; and with more smiling
 solemnity replied,--
 
“it gives the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
 time not disagreeably. we have certainly done our best; and most
 fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
 society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of
 varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that
 your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. our situation
 with regard to lady catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of
 extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. you see on
 what footing we are. you see how continually we are engaged there. in
 truth, i must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this
 humble parsonage, i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of
 compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings.”
 
words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and was
 obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility
 and truth in few short sentences.
 
“you may, in fact, carry very favourable report of us into
 hertfordshire, my dear cousin. i flatter myself, at least, that you will
 be able to do so. lady catherine’s great attentions to mrs. collins you
 have been daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear
 that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
 as well to be silent. only let assure you, my dear miss elizabeth,
 that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
 marriage. my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
 thinking. there is in everything most remarkable resemblance of
 character and ideas between us. we seem to have been designed for each
 other.”
 
elizabeth could safely say that it was great happiness where that was
 the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
 and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. she was not sorry, however, to
 have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
 whom they sprang. poor charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such
 society! but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently
 regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for
 compassion. her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,
 and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
 
at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
 placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. after an affectionate
 parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
 mr. collins; and as they walked down the garden, was commissioning
 her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
 for the kindness had received at longbourn in the winter, and his
 compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner, though unknown. then handed
 her in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
 when suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
 hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings.
 
[illustration:
 
“they had forgotten to leave any message”
 ]
 
“but,” added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects
 delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
 while you have been here.”
 
elizabeth made objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and
 the carriage drove off.
 
“good gracious!” cried maria, after few minutes’ silence, “it seems
 but day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
 happened!”
 
“a great many indeed,” said her companion, with sigh.
 
“we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
 how much i shall have to tell!”
 
elizabeth privately added, “and how much i shall have to conceal!”
 
their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
 within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr. gardiner’s
 house, where they were to remain few days.
 
jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
 spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
 had reserved for them. but jane was to go home with her, and at
 longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
 
it was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
 longbourn, before she told her sister of mr. darcy’s proposals. to know
 that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
 jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
 vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such temptation
 to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
 in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,
 and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
 repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister
 further.

“how nicely we are crammed in”

chapter xxxix.
 

[illustration]
 
it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out
 together from gracechurch street for the town of ----, in hertfordshire;
 and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet’s carriage was
 to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s
 punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of dining-room upstairs.
 these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
 in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
 dressing salad and cucumber.
 
after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed table set
 out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
 “is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”
 
“and we mean to treat you all,” added lydia; “but you must lend us the
 money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” then showing
 her purchases,--“look here, i have bought this bonnet. i do not think it
 is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not. i shall
 pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any
 better.”
 
and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
 unconcern, “oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
 when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i
 think it will be very tolerable. besides, it will not much signify what
 one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they
 are going in fortnight.”
 
“are they, indeed?” cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
 
“they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to
 take us all there for the summer! it would be such delicious scheme,
 and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all. mamma would like to
 go, too, of all things! only think what miserable summer else we shall
 have!”
 
“yes,” thought elizabeth; “_that_ would be delightful scheme, indeed,
 and completely do for us at once. good heaven! brighton and whole
 campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
 regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton!”
 
“now i have got some news for you,” said lydia, as they sat down to
 table. “what do you think? it is excellent news, capital news, and about
 certain person that we all like.”
 
jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
 need not stay. lydia laughed, and said,--
 
“ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. you thought the
 waiter must not hear, as if cared! i dare say often hears worse
 things said than i am going to say. but is an ugly fellow! i am glad
 is gone. i never saw such long chin in my life. well, but now for
 my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?
 there is danger of wickham’s marrying mary king--there’s for you! she
 is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay. wickham is safe.”
 
“and mary king is safe!” added elizabeth; “safe from connection
 imprudent as to fortune.”
 
“she is great fool for going away, if she liked him.”
 
“but i hope there is strong attachment on either side,” said jane.
 
“i am sure there is not on _his_. i will answer for it, never cared
 three straws about her. who _could_ about such nasty little freckled
 thing?”
 
elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
 coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
 was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
 liberal!
 
as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
 ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
 boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty’s and
 lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.
 
“how nicely we are crammed in!” cried lydia. “i am glad i brought my
 bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! well, now
 let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
 home. and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
 since you went away. have you seen any pleasant men? have you had any
 flirting? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got husband
 before you came back. jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.
 she is almost three-and-twenty! lord! how ashamed i should be of not
 being married before three-and-twenty! my aunt philips wants you so to
 get husbands you can’t think. she says lizzy had better have taken mr.
 collins; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. lord!
 how i should like to be married before any of you! and then i would
 _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. dear me! we had such good piece
 of fun the other day at colonel forster’s! kitty and were to spend
 the day there, and mrs. forster promised to have little dance in the
 evening; (by-the-bye, mrs. forster and are _such_ friends!) and so
 she asked the two harringtons to come: but harriet was ill, and so pen
 was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? we
 dressed up chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a
 lady,--only think what fun! not soul knew of it, but colonel and mrs.
 forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
 one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well looked! when denny,
 and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
 did not know him in the least. lord! how i laughed! and so did mrs.
 forster. i thought i should have died. and _that_ made the men suspect
 something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”
 
with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia,
 assisted by kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
 companions all the way to longbourn. elizabeth listened as little as she
 could, but there was escaping the frequent mention of wickham’s name.
 
their reception at home was most kind. mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane
 in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet
 say voluntarily to elizabeth,----
 
“i am glad you are come back, lizzy.”
 
their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases
 came to meet maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects
 which occupied them: lady lucas was inquiring of maria, across the
 table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs. bennet
 was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
 fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
 retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in voice
 rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various
 pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.
 
“oh, mary,” said she, “i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
 as we went along kitty and drew up all the blinds, and pretended
 there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if
 kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we
 behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
 cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
 treated you too. and then when we came away it was such fun! i thought
 we never should have got into the coach. i was ready to die of laughter.
 and then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so
 loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”
 
to this, mary very gravely replied, “far be it from me, my dear sister,
 to depreciate such pleasures. they would doubtless be congenial with the
 generality of female minds. but i confess they would have charms for
 _me_. i should infinitely prefer book.”
 
but of this answer lydia heard not word. she seldom listened to
 anybody for more than half minute, and never attended to mary at all.
 
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
 meryton, and see how everybody went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed
 the scheme. it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at
 home half day before they were in pursuit of the officers. there was
 another reason, too, for her opposition. she dreaded seeing wickham
 again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. the comfort to
 _her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond
 expression. in fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped
 there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.
 
she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton
 scheme, of which lydia had given them hint at the inn, was under
 frequent discussion between her parents. elizabeth saw directly that her
 father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
 at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
 disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.

elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no
 longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
 in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
 she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr.
 darcy and herself.
 
miss bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
 partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
 natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. she was
 sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in manner so
 little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
 unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.
 
“his being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly
 ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
 disappointment.”
 
“indeed,” replied elizabeth, “i am heartily sorry for him; but has
 other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
 you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”
 
“blame you! oh, no.”
 
“but you blame for having spoken so warmly of wickham?”
 
“no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
 
“but you _will_ know it, when i have told you what happened the very
 next day.”
 
she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
 as they concerned george wickham. what stroke was this for poor jane,
 who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
 so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here
 collected in one individual! nor was darcy’s vindication, though
 grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
 most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
 seek to clear one, without involving the other.
 
“this will not do,” said elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both
 of them good for anything. take your choice, but you must be satisfied
 with only one. there is but such quantity of merit between them; just
 enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
 about pretty much. for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr.
 darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”
 
it was some time, however, before smile could be extorted from jane.
 
“i do not know when i have been more shocked,” said she. “wickham so
 very bad! it is almost past belief. and poor mr. darcy! dear lizzy,
 only consider what must have suffered. such disappointment! and
 with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a
 thing of his sister! it is really too distressing, i am sure you must
 feel it so.”
 
“oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full
 of both. i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing
 every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. your profusion makes me
 saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as
 light as feather.”
 
“poor wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
 countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”
 
“there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
 two young men. one has got all the goodness, and the other all the
 appearance of it.”
 
“i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
 used to do.”
 
“and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided dislike
 to him, without any reason. it is such spur to one’s genius, such an
 opening for wit, to have dislike of that kind. one may be continually
 abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing
 at man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”
 
“lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat
 the matter as you do now.”
 
“indeed, i could not. i was uncomfortable enough, i was very
 uncomfortable--i may say unhappy. and with one to speak to of what i
 felt, jane to comfort me, and say that i had not been so very weak,
 and vain, and nonsensical, as i knew i had! oh, how i wanted you!”
 
“how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
 in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
 undeserved.”
 
“certainly. but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is most
 natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging. there is
 one point on which i want your advice. i want to be told whether i
 ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand
 wickham’s character.”
 
miss bennet paused little, and then replied, “surely there can be no
 occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. what is your own opinion?”
 
“that it ought not to be attempted. mr. darcy has not authorized to
 make his communication public. on the contrary, every particular
 relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
 myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
 conduct, who will believe me? the general prejudice against mr. darcy is
 so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
 meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. i am not equal to
 it. wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to
 anybody here what really is. some time hence it will be all found
 out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.
 at present i will say nothing about it.”
 
“you are quite right. to have his errors made public might ruin him for
 ever. is now, perhaps, sorry for what has done, and anxious to
 re-establish character. we must not make him desperate.”
 
the tumult of elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. she
 had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a
 fortnight, and was certain of willing listener in jane, whenever she
 might wish to talk again of either. but there was still something
 lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. she dared not
 relate the other half of mr. darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister
 how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. here was knowledge in
 which one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than
 perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in
 throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “and then,” said she, “if
 that very improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be
 able to tell what bingley may tell in much more agreeable manner
 himself. the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost
 all its value!”
 
she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
 state of her sister’s spirits. jane was not happy. she still cherished a
 very tender affection for bingley. having never even fancied herself in
 love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
 her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
 boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
 every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
 feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
 regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their
 tranquillity.
 
“well, lizzy,” said mrs. bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of
 this sad business of jane’s? for my part, i am determined never to speak
 of it again to anybody. i told my sister philips so the other day. but i
 cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london. well, is a
 very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least
 chance in the world of her ever getting him now. there is talk of his
 coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have inquired of
 everybody, too, who is likely to know.”
 
[illustration:
 
“i am determined never to speak of it again”
 ]
 
“i do not believe that will ever live at netherfield any more.”
 
“oh, well! it is just as chooses. nobody wants him to come; though i
 shall always say that used my daughter extremely ill; and, if i was
 her, i would not have put up with it. well, my comfort is, i am sure
 jane will die of broken heart, and then will be sorry for what he
 has done.”
 
but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she
 made answer.
 
“well, lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the
 collinses live very comfortable, do they? well, well, i only hope it
 will last. and what sort of table do they keep? charlotte is an
 excellent manager, i dare say. if she is half as sharp as her mother,
 she is saving enough. there is nothing extravagant in _their_
 housekeeping, i dare say.”
 
“no, nothing at all.”
 
“a great deal of good management, depend upon it. yes, yes. _they_ will
 take care not to outrun their income. _they_ will never be distressed
 for money. well, much good may it do them! and so, i suppose, they often
 talk of having longbourn when your father is dead. they look upon it
 quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens.”
 
“it was subject which they could not mention before me.”
 
“no; it would have been strange if they had. but i make doubt they
 often talk of it between themselves. well, if they can be easy with an
 estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _i_ should be
 ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”

“when colonel miller’s regiment went away”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 



chapter xli.
 

[illustration]
 
the first week of their return was soon gone. the second began. it was
 the last of the regiment’s stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in
 the neighbourhood were drooping apace. the dejection was almost
 universal. the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
 and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. very
 frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
 lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
 hard-heartedness in any of the family.
 
“good heaven! what is to become of us? what are we to do?” would they
 often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “how can you be smiling so,
 lizzy?”
 
their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
 she had herself endured on similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.
 
“i am sure,” said she, “i cried for two days together when colonel
 miller’s regiment went away. i thought i should have broke my heart.”
 
“i am sure i shall break _mine_,” said lydia.
 
“if one could but go to brighton!” observed mrs. bennet.
 
“oh yes!--if one could but go to brighton! but papa is so disagreeable.”
 
“a little sea-bathing would set up for ever.”
 
“and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ great deal of good,”
 added kitty.
 
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
 longbourn house. elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
 of pleasure was lost in shame. she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy’s
 objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
 interference in the views of his friend.
 
but the gloom of lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
 received an invitation from mrs. forster, the wife of the colonel of the
 regiment, to accompany her to brighton. this invaluable friend was a
 very young woman, and very lately married. resemblance in good-humour
 and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of
 their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.
 
the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs. forster,
 the delight of mrs. bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely
 to be described. wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, lydia flew
 about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s
 congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
 whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
 in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
 
“i cannot see why mrs. forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia,”
 said she, “though i am _not_ her particular friend. i have just as much
 right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older.”
 
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make
 her resigned. as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
 exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she
 considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
 for the latter; and detestable as such step must make her, were it
 known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
 go. she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia’s general
 behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
 such woman as mrs. forster, and the probability of her being yet more
 imprudent with such companion at brighton, where the temptations must
 be greater than at home. heard her attentively, and then said,--
 
“lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
 place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
 expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
 circumstances.”
 
“if you were aware,” said elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to
 us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia’s unguarded and
 imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you
 would judge differently in the affair.”
 
“already arisen!” repeated mr. bennet. “what! has she frightened away
 some of your lovers? poor little lizzy! but do not be cast down. such
 squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with little absurdity
 are not worth regret. come, let see the list of the pitiful fellows
 who have been kept aloof by lydia’s folly.”
 
“indeed, you are mistaken. i have such injuries to resent. it is not
 of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining. our
 importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
 wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
 lydia’s character. excuse me,--for i must speak plainly. if you, my dear
 father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
 of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
 her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. her character
 will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
 that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the
 worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
 youth and tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of
 her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
 contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. in this danger kitty
 is also comprehended. she will follow wherever lydia leads. vain,
 ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! oh, my dear father, can you
 suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
 they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
 disgrace?”
 
mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,
 affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--
 
“do not make yourself uneasy, my love. wherever you and jane are known,
 you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
 advantage for having couple of--or i may say, three--very silly
 sisters. we shall have peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
 brighton. let her go, then. colonel forster is sensible man, and will
 keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
 object of prey to anybody. at brighton she will be of less importance
 even as common flirt than she has been here. the officers will find
 women better worth their notice. let us hope, therefore, that her being
 there may teach her her own insignificance. at any rate, she cannot grow
 many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
 of her life.”
 
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
 continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. it was not
 in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.
 she was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over
 unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was part of her
 disposition.
 
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
 father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
 united volubility. in lydia’s imagination, visit to brighton comprised
 every possibility of earthly happiness. she saw, with the creative eye
 of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
 she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at
 present unknown. she saw all the glories of the camp: its tents
 stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
 and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
 saw herself seated beneath tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
 officers at once.
 
[illustration:
 
“tenderly flirting”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
 such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? they could
 have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
 same. lydia’s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the
 melancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there
 himself.
 
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
 continued, with little intermission, to the very day of lydia’s leaving
 home.
 
elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time. having been
 frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
 well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. she had even
 learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
 an affectation and sameness to disgust and weary. in his present
 behaviour to herself, moreover, she had fresh source of displeasure;
 for the inclination soon testified of renewing those attentions which
 had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
 what had since passed, to provoke her. she lost all concern for him in
 finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
 gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
 reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
 cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
 and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.
 
on the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in meryton, dined,
 with others of the officers, at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth
 disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some
 inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she
 mentioned colonel fitzwilliam’s and mr. darcy’s having both spent three
 weeks at rosings, and asked him if were acquainted with the former.
 
looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with moment’s
 recollection, and returning smile, replied, that had formerly seen
 him often; and, after observing that was very gentlemanlike man,
 asked her how she had liked him. her answer was warmly in his favour.
 with an air of indifference, soon afterwards added, “how long did you
 say that was at rosings?”
 
“nearly three weeks.”
 
“and you saw him frequently?”
 
“yes, almost every day.”
 
“his manners are very different from his cousin’s.”
 
“yes, very different; but i think mr. darcy improves on acquaintance.”
 
“indeed!” cried wickham, with look which did not escape her. “and pray
 may i ask--” but checking himself, added, in gayer tone, “is it in
 address that improves? has deigned to add aught of civility to his
 ordinary style? for i dare not hope,” continued, in lower and more
 serious tone, “that is improved in essentials.”
 
“oh, no!” said elizabeth. “in essentials, i believe, is very much
 what ever was.”
 
while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
 rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. there was a
 something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
 and anxious attention, while she added,--
 
“when i said that improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that
 either his mind or manners were in state of improvement; but that,
 from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”
 
wickham’s alarm now appeared in heightened complexion and agitated
 look; for few minutes was silent; till, shaking off his
 embarrassment, turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
 accents,--
 
“you, who so well know my feelings towards mr. darcy, will readily
 comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that is wise enough to assume
 even the _appearance_ of what is right. his pride, in that direction,
 may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
 him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by. i only fear that
 the sort of cautiousness to which you, i imagine, have been alluding, is
 merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
 judgment stands much in awe. his fear of her has always operated, i
 know, when they were together; and good deal is to be imputed to his
 wish of forwarding the match with miss bourgh, which i am certain he
 has very much at heart.”
 
elizabeth could not repress smile at this, but she answered only by a
 slight inclination of the head. she saw that wanted to engage her on
 the old subject of his grievances, and she was in humour to indulge
 him. the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
 of usual cheerfulness, but with further attempt to distinguish
 elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
 mutual desire of never meeting again.
 
when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton,
 from whence they were to set out early the next morning. the separation
 between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. kitty was the
 only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. mrs.
 bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
 and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
 opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there
 was every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous
 happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
 of her sisters were uttered without being heard.

chapter xlii.
 

[illustration]
 
had elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
 not have formed very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
 comfort. her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
 of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
 woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
 their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. respect,
 esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of
 domestic happiness were overthrown. but mr. bennet was not of a
 disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
 imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often
 console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. was fond of
 the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
 enjoyments. to his wife was very little otherwise indebted than as
 her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. this is not
 the sort of happiness which man would in general wish to owe to his
 wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
 philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
 
elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
 father’s behaviour as husband. she had always seen it with pain; but
 respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
 herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
 banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
 and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
 children, was so highly reprehensible. but she had never felt so
 strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
 unsuitable marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
 from so ill-judged direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,
 might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
 if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
 
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham’s departure, she found little
 other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. their parties
 abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had mother and
 sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around
 them threw real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty
 might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
 of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
 greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
 folly and assurance, by situation of such double danger as a
 watering-place and camp. upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
 has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked
 forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the
 satisfaction she had promised herself. it was consequently necessary to
 name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
 some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
 again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
 present, and prepare for another disappointment. her tour to the lakes
 was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation
 for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
 and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in the
 scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.
 
“but it is fortunate,” thought she, “that i have something to wish for.
 were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
 but here, by carrying with one ceaseless source of regret in my
 sister’s absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
 pleasure realized. scheme of which every part promises delight can
 never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
 the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”
 
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
 to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
 always very short. those to her mother contained little else than that
 they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
 had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
 made her quite wild; that she had new gown, or new parasol, which
 she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
 violent hurry, as mrs. forster called her, and they were going to the
 camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less
 to be learnt, for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much
 too full of lines under the words to be made public.
 
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,
 good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn. everything
 wore happier aspect. the families who had been in town for the winter
 came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. mrs.
 bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle
 of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton
 without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth
 hope, that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably
 reasonable as not to mention an officer above once day, unless, by
 some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office, another regiment
 should be quartered in meryton.
 
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
 approaching; and fortnight only was wanting of it, when letter
 arrived from mrs. gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
 curtailed its extent. mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from
 setting out till fortnight later in july, and must be in london again
 within month; and as that left too short period for them to go so
 far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
 the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
 the lakes, and substitute more contracted tour; and, according to the
 present plan, were to go farther northward than derbyshire. in that
 county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
 weeks; and to mrs. gardiner it had peculiarly strong attraction. the
 town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
 they were now to spend few days, was probably as great an object of
 her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock, chatsworth,
 dovedale, or the peak.
 
elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing
 the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. but it
 was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
 and all was soon right again.
 
with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. it was
 impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
 owner. “but surely,” said she, “i may enter his county with impunity,
 and rob it of few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”
 
the period of expectation was now doubled. four weeks were to pass away
 before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. but they did pass away, and mr. and
 mrs. gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
 longbourn. the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
 younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
 jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
 sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
 way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.
 
the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn, and set off the next
 morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. one
 enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
 suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
 inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
 and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
 disappointments abroad.
 
it is not the object of this work to give description of derbyshire,
 nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
 lay--oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenilworth, birmingham, etc., are
 sufficiently known. small part of derbyshire is all the present
 concern. to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs. gardiner’s
 former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
 acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
 all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
 lambton, elizabeth found, from her aunt, that pemberley was situated. it
 was not in their direct road; nor more than mile or two out of it. in
 talking over their route the evening before, mrs. gardiner expressed an
 inclination to see the place again. mr. gardiner declared his
 willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.
 
“my love, should not you like to see place of which you have heard so
 much?” said her aunt. “a place, too, with which so many of your
 acquaintance are connected. wickham passed all his youth there, you
 know.”
 
elizabeth was distressed. she felt that she had business at
 pemberley, and was obliged to assume disinclination for seeing it. she
 must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,
 she really had pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
 
mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity. “if it were merely fine house
 richly furnished,” said she, “i should not care about it myself; but the
 grounds are delightful. they have some of the finest woods in the
 country.”
 
elizabeth said more; but her mind could not acquiesce. the
 possibility of meeting mr. darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
 occurred. it would be dreadful! she blushed at the very idea; and
 thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such
 risk. but against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
 that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the
 absence of the family were unfavourably answered.
 
accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
 whether pemberley were not very fine place, what was the name of its
 proprietor, and, with little alarm, whether the family were down for
 the summer? most welcome negative followed the last question; and her
 alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel great deal of
 curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
 next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
 with proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
 to the scheme.
 
to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.

chapter xliii.
 

[illustration]
 
elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
 pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
 in at the lodge, her spirits were in high flutter.
 
the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. they
 entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
 beautiful wood stretching over wide extent.
 
elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
 every remarkable spot and point of view. they gradually ascended for
 half mile, and then found themselves at the top of considerable
 eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
 pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which
 the road with some abruptness wound. it was large, handsome stone
 building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by ridge of high
 woody hills; and in front stream of some natural importance was
 swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. its banks
 were neither formal nor falsely adorned. elizabeth was delighted. she
 had never seen place for which nature had done more, or where natural
 beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. they were
 all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
 to be mistress of pemberley might be something!
 
they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
 while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
 meeting its owner returned. she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
 mistaken. on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
 hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
 wonder at her being where she was.
 
the housekeeper came; respectable looking elderly woman, much less
 fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. they
 followed her into the dining-parlour. it was large, well-proportioned
 room, handsomely fitted up. elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
 to window to enjoy its prospect. the hill, crowned with wood, from
 which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
 distance, was beautiful object. every disposition of the ground was
 good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
 on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
 it, with delight. as they passed into other rooms, these objects were
 taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties
 to be seen. the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture
 suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with
 admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly
 fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the
 furniture of rosings.
 
“and of this place,” thought she, “i might have been mistress! with
 these rooms i might have now been familiarly acquainted! instead of
 viewing them as stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
 welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. but, no,” recollecting
 herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
 me; i should not have been allowed to invite them.”
 
this was lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.
 
she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really
 absent, but had not courage for it. at length, however, the question was
 asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs. reynolds
 replied, that was; adding, “but we expect him to-morrow, with large
 party of friends.” how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had
 not by any circumstance been delayed day!
 
her aunt now called her to look at picture. she approached, and saw
 the likeness of mr. wickham, suspended, amongst several other
 miniatures, over the mantel-piece. her aunt asked her, smilingly, how
 she liked it. the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the
 picture of young gentleman, the of her late master’s steward, who
 had been brought up by him at his own expense. “he is now gone into the
 army,” she added; “but i am afraid has turned out very wild.”
 
mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with smile, but elizabeth could not
 return it.
 
“and that,” said mrs. reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
 “is my master--and very like him. it was drawn at the same time as the
 other--about eight years ago.”
 
“i have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said mrs. gardiner,
 looking at the picture; “it is handsome face. but, lizzy, you can tell
 us whether it is like or not.”
 
mrs. reynolds’ respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
 intimation of her knowing her master.
 
“does that young lady know mr. darcy?”
 
elizabeth coloured, and said, “a little.”
 
“and do not you think him very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”
 
“yes, very handsome.”
 
“i am sure _i_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you
 will see finer, larger picture of him than this. this room was my late
 master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
 be then. was very fond of them.”
 
this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickham’s being among them.
 
mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn
 when she was only eight years old.
 
“and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?” said mr. gardiner.
 
“oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
 accomplished! she plays and sings all day long. in the next room is a
 new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she
 comes here to-morrow with him.”
 
mr. gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
 communicativeness by his questions and remarks: mrs. reynolds, either
 from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
 master and his sister.
 
“is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?”
 
“not so much as i could wish, sir: but i dare say may spend half his
 time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months.”
 
“except,” thought elizabeth, “when she goes to ramsgate.”
 
“if your master would marry, you might see more of him.”
 
“yes, sir; but i do not know when _that_ will be. i do not know who is
 good enough for him.”
 
mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled. elizabeth could not help saying, “it is
 very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so.”
 
“i say more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows
 him,” replied the other. elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
 and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
 “i have never had cross word from him in my life, and i have known him
 ever since was four years old.”
 
this was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
 ideas. that was not good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
 her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was
 grateful to her uncle for saying,--
 
“there are very few people of whom so much can be said. you are lucky in
 having such master.”
 
“yes, sir, i know i am. if i were to go through the world, i could not
 meet with better. but i have always observed, that they who are
 good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
 was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
 world.”
 
elizabeth almost stared at her. “can this be mr. darcy?” thought she.
 
“his father was an excellent man,” said mrs. gardiner.
 
“yes, ma’am, that was indeed; and his will be just like him--just
 as affable to the poor.”
 
elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. mrs.
 reynolds could interest her on other point. she related the subjects
 of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
 furniture in vain. mr. gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
 prejudice, to which attributed her excessive commendation of her
 master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
 many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.
 
“he is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever
 lived. not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
 themselves. there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
 give him good name. some people call him proud; but i am sure i never
 saw anything of it. to my fancy, it is only because does not rattle
 away like other young men.”
 
“in what an amiable light does this place him!” thought elizabeth.
 
“this fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not
 quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”
 
“perhaps we might be deceived.”
 
“that is not very likely; our authority was too good.”
 
on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into very pretty
 sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
 the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
 give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken liking to the room, when
 last at pemberley.
 
“he is certainly good brother,” said elizabeth, as she walked towards
 one of the windows.
 
mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy’s delight, when she should enter
 the room. “and this is always the way with him,” she added. “whatever
 can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in moment. there
 is nothing would not do for her.”
 
the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
 all that remained to be shown. in the former were many good paintings:
 but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
 visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
 darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
 also more intelligible.
 
in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
 little to fix the attention of stranger. elizabeth walked on in quest
 of the only face whose features would be known to her. at last it
 arrested her--and she beheld striking resemblance of mr. darcy, with
 such smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
 when looked at her. she stood several minutes before the picture, in
 earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
 gallery. mrs. reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
 father’s lifetime.
 
there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth’s mind, more gentle
 sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of
 their acquaintance. the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds
 was of trifling nature. what praise is more valuable than the praise
 of an intelligent servant? as brother, landlord, master, she
 considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! how
 much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! how much of good
 or evil must be done by him! every idea that had been brought forward by
 the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before
 the canvas, on which was represented, and fixed his eyes upon
 herself, she thought of his regard with deeper sentiment of gratitude
 than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened
 its impropriety of expression.
 
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
 they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
 consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.
 
as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back
 to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was
 conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
 suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.
 
they were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his
 appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. their eyes
 instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
 blush. absolutely started, and for moment seemed immovable from
 surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
 and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
 of perfect civility.
 
she had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
 received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
 overcome. had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
 they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
 that they now saw mr. darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on
 beholding his master, must immediately have told it. they stood little
 aloof while was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
 scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
 returned to his civil inquiries after her family. amazed at the
 alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
 uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
 impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
 minutes in which they continued together were some of the most
 uncomfortable of her life. nor did seem much more at ease; when he
 spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and repeated his
 inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay
 in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried way, as plainly spoke the
 distraction of his thoughts.
 
at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing few
 moments without saying word, suddenly recollected himself, and took
 leave.
 
the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
 figure; but elizabeth heard not word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
 feelings, followed them in silence. she was overpowered by shame and
 vexation. her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
 thing in the world! how strange must it appear to him! in what a
 disgraceful light might it not strike so vain man! it might seem as if
 she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! oh! why did she come?
 or, why did thus come day before was expected? had they been
 only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
 discrimination; for it was plain that was that moment arrived, that
 moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. she blushed again and
 again over the perverseness of the meeting. and his behaviour, so
 strikingly altered,--what could it mean? that should even speak to
 her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her
 family! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
 never had spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.
 what contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park, when
 put his letter into her hand! she knew not what to think, or how to
 account for it.
 
they had now entered beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
 every step was bringing forward nobler fall of ground, or finer
 reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time
 before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
 mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
 to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
 distinguished part of the scene. her thoughts were all fixed on that
 one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr. darcy then
 was. she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
 what manner thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
 she was still dear to him. perhaps had been civil only because he
 felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
 not like ease. whether had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
 her, she could not tell, but certainly had not seen her with
 composure.
 
at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
 roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.
 
they entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for while,
 ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
 of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
 the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
 overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. mr. gardiner
 expressed wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be
 beyond walk. with triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
 miles round. it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
 circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in descent among
 hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.
 they crossed it by simple bridge, in character with the general air of
 the scene: it was spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
 the valley, here contracted into glen, allowed room only for the
 stream, and narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
 it. elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
 the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs. gardiner,
 who was not great walker, could go farther, and thought only of
 returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. her niece was,
 therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
 on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
 progress was slow, for mr. gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
 taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
 occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
 about them, that advanced but little. whilst wandering on in this
 slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth’s astonishment was
 quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr. darcy
 approaching them, and at great distance. the walk being here less
 sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
 met. elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
 interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
 calmness, if really intended to meet them. for few moments, indeed,
 she felt that would probably strike into some other path. the idea
 lasted while turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
 turning past, was immediately before them. with glance she saw that
 had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,
 she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not
 got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky
 recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of pemberley from
 her might be mischievously construed. her colour changed, and she said
 more.
 
mrs. gardiner was standing little behind; and on her pausing, asked
 her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
 this was stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
 she could hardly suppress smile at his being now seeking the
 acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
 revolted, in his offer to herself. “what will be his surprise,” thought
 she, “when knows who they are! takes them now for people of
 fashion.”
 
the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
 relationship to herself, she stole sly look at him, to see how bore
 it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
 could from such disgraceful companions. that was _surprised_ by the
 connection was evident: sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,
 so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
 conversation with mr. gardiner. elizabeth could not but be pleased,
 could not but triumph. it was consoling that should know she had some
 relations for whom there was need to blush. she listened most
 attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
 expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
 his taste, or his good manners.
 
the conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard mr. darcy
 invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
 chose, while continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
 time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
 the stream where there was usually most sport. mrs. gardiner, who was
 walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her look expressive of her
 wonder. elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
 compliment must be all for herself. her astonishment, however, was
 extreme; and continually was she repeating, “why is so altered? from
 what can it proceed? it cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
 that his manners are thus softened. my reproofs at hunsford could not
 work such change as this. it is impossible that should still love
 me.”
 
after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
 gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
 brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
 water-plant, there chanced to be little alteration. it originated in
 mrs. gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
 elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
 her husband’s. mr. darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
 together. after short silence the lady first spoke. she wished him to
 know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
 place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
 very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that
 you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we
 left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
 the country.” acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
 business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward few hours
 before the rest of the party with whom had been travelling. “they
 will join early to-morrow,” continued, “and among them are some
 who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr. bingley and his sisters.”
 
elizabeth answered only by slight bow. her thoughts were instantly
 driven back to the time when mr. bingley’s name had been last mentioned
 between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
 not very differently engaged.
 
“there is also one other person in the party,” continued after a
 pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. will you allow
 me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
 during your stay at lambton?”
 
the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
 for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. she immediately felt
 that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
 must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
 satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
 him think really ill of her.
 
they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. elizabeth
 was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
 pleased. his wish of introducing his sister to her was compliment of
 the highest kind. they soon outstripped the others; and when they had
 reached the carriage, mr. and mrs. gardiner were half quarter of a
 mile behind.
 
then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
 tired, and they stood together on the lawn. at such time much might
 have been said, and silence was very awkward. she wanted to talk, but
 there seemed an embargo on every subject. at last she recollected that
 she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dovedale with
 great perseverance. yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
 and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.
 
on mr. and mrs. gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into
 the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they
 parted on each side with the utmost politeness. mr. darcy handed the
 ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him
 walking slowly towards the house.
 
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
 pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
 
“he is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.
 
“there _is_ something little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her
 aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. i can now
 say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
 _i_ have seen nothing of it.”
 
“i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. it was more
 than civil; it was really attentive; and there was necessity for such
 attention. his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling.”
 
“to be sure, lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as wickham;
 or rather has not wickham’s countenance, for his features are
 perfectly good. but how came you to tell us that was so
 disagreeable?”
 
elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked
 him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never
 seen him so pleasant as this morning.
 
“but perhaps may be little whimsical in his civilities,” replied
 her uncle. “your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him
 at his word about fishing, as might change his mind another day, and
 warn off his grounds.”
 
elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
 nothing.
 
“from what we have seen of him,” continued mrs. gardiner, “i really
 should not have thought that could have behaved in so cruel way by
 anybody as has done by poor wickham. has not an ill-natured look.
 on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
 speaks. and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would
 not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. but, to be sure, the
 good lady who showed us the house did give him most flaming character!
 i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. but is liberal
 master, i suppose, and _that_, in the eye of servant, comprehends
 every virtue.”
 
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
 his behaviour to wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as
 guarded manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
 relations in kent, his actions were capable of very different
 construction; and that his character was by means so faulty, nor
 wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire. in
 confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
 transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
 her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.
 
mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now
 approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
 the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
 to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
 anything else. fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had
 sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
 acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
 intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.
 
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
 much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
 but think, and think with wonder, of mr. darcy’s civility, and, above
 all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.

elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit
 her the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was, consequently,
 resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
 but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
 arrival at lambton these visitors came. they had been walking about the
 place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
 to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
 carriage drew them to window, and they saw gentleman and lady in a
 curricle driving up the street. elizabeth, immediately recognizing the
 livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted small degree of surprise
 to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
 expected. her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
 of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
 of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them new idea on
 the business. nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
 that there was other way of accounting for such attentions from such
 quarter than by supposing partiality for their niece. while these
 newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
 elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. she was quite amazed
 at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she
 dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
 her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
 suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.
 
she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
 up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
 inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.
 
miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
 took place. with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new
 acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. since her
 being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud;
 but the observation of very few minutes convinced her that she was
 only exceedingly shy. she found it difficult to obtain even word from
 her beyond monosyllable.
 
miss darcy was tall, and on larger scale than elizabeth; and, though
 little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
 womanly and graceful. she was less handsome than her brother, but there
 was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
 unassuming and gentle. elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
 acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been, was much
 relieved by discerning such different feelings.
 
they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was
 also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
 satisfaction, and prepare for such visitor, when bingley’s quick step
 was heard on the stairs, and in moment entered the room. all
 elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
 felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
 cordiality with which expressed himself on seeing her again. he
 inquired in friendly, though general, way, after her family, and
 looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that had ever done.
 
to mr. and mrs. gardiner was scarcely less interesting personage
 than to herself. they had long wished to see him. the whole party before
 them, indeed, excited lively attention. the suspicions which had just
 arisen of mr. darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
 each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from
 those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
 it was to love. of the lady’s sensations they remained little in
 doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
 evident enough.
 
elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. she wanted to ascertain the
 feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
 make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
 feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom
 she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.
 bingley was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be
 pleased.

in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
 how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a
 like manner. sometimes she could fancy that talked less than on
 former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
 that, as looked at her, was trying to trace resemblance. but,
 though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
 behaviour to miss darcy, who had been set up as rival to jane. no
 look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. nothing
 occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. on
 this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances
 occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted
 recollection of jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and wish of
 saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had dared. he
 observed to her, at moment when the others were talking together, and
 in tone which had something of real regret, that it “was very long
 time since had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could
 reply, added, “it is above eight months. we have not met since the
 26th of november, when we were all dancing together at netherfield.”
 
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and afterwards
 took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
 _all_ her sisters were at longbourn. there was not much in the question,
 nor in the preceding remark; but there was look and manner which
 gave them meaning.
 
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself; but
 whenever she did catch glimpse she saw an expression of general
 complaisance, and in all that said, she heard an accent so far
 removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her
 that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,
 however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one
 day. when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the
 good opinion of people with whom any intercourse few months ago would
 have been disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,
 but to the very relations whom had openly disdained, and recollected
 their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the
 change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could
 hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. never, even in the
 company of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations
 at rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
 self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when importance could
 result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
 acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
 down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
 rosings.
 
their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose
 to depart, mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
 their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner
 at pemberley, before they left the country. miss darcy, though with a
 diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
 readily obeyed. mrs. gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
 how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
 acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head. presuming, however,
 that this studied avoidance spoke rather momentary embarrassment than
 any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
 society, perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
 her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
 
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
 again, having still great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
 make after all their hertfordshire friends. elizabeth, construing all
 this into wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and
 on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
 visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
 satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been
 little. eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
 uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
 favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
 
but she had reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner’s curiosity; it was
 not their wish to force her communication. it was evident that she was
 much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of;
 it was evident that was very much in love with her. they saw much to
 interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
 
of mr. darcy it was now matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
 as their acquaintance reached, there was fault to find. they could
 not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
 from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference
 to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which was known
 would not have recognized it for mr. darcy. there was now an interest,
 however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
 that the authority of servant, who had known him since was four
 years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
 hastily rejected. neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
 their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. they had
 nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride probably had, and if not,
 it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of small market town
 where the family did not visit. it was acknowledged, however, that he
 was liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
 
with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that was not held
 there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
 of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet well-known
 fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, had left many debts behind
 him, which mr. darcy afterwards discharged.
 
as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than
 the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
 long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
 she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. she
 certainly did not hate him. no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
 had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling dislike against him,
 that could be so called. the respect created by the conviction of his
 valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
 time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
 into somewhat of friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his
 favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable light,
 which yesterday had produced. but above all, above respect and esteem,
 there was motive within her of good-will which could not be
 overlooked. it was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once
 loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the
 petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
 unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. who, she had been
 persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
 accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and
 without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,
 where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good
 opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. such
 change in man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but
 gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as
 such, its impression on her was of sort to be encouraged, as by no
 means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. she respected,
 she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt real interest in his
 welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
 depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
 that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
 possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.
 
it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
 such striking civility as miss darcy’s, in coming to them on the very
 day of her arrival at pemberley--for she had reached it only to late
 breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
 some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
 would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
 morning. they were, therefore, to go. elizabeth was pleased; though when
 she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
 
mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast. the fishing scheme had been
 renewed the day before, and positive engagement made of his meeting
 some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.

convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley’s dislike of her had
 originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
 her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know
 with how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now
 be renewed.
 
on reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
 whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. its windows,
 opening to the ground, admitted most refreshing view of the high woody
 hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts
 which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.
 
in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there
 with mrs. hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
 london. georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with
 all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
 fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
 inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. mrs. gardiner and
 her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.
 
by mrs. hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by courtesy; and
 on their being seated, pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
 succeeded for few moments. it was first broken by mrs. annesley, a
 genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
 of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
 others; and between her and mrs. gardiner, with occasional help from
 elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. miss darcy looked as if she
 wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
 short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.
 
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley,
 and that she could not speak word, especially to miss darcy, without
 calling her attention. this observation would not have prevented her
 from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
 inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
 of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. she expected every
 moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she
 feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
 she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. after
 sitting in this manner quarter of an hour, without hearing miss
 bingley’s voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her cold
 inquiry after the health of her family. she answered with equal
 indifference and brevity, and the other said more.
 
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
 entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and variety of all the
 finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
 significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been
 given, to remind her of her post. there was now employment for the whole
 party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
 beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
 them round the table.
 
while thus engaged, elizabeth had fair opportunity of deciding whether
 she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy, by the
 feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
 moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
 regret that came.
 
had been some time with mr. gardiner, who, with two or three other
 gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him
 only on learning that the ladies of the family intended visit to
 georgiana that morning. sooner did appear, than elizabeth wisely
 resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
 necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
 saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
 and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
 when first came into the room. in countenance was attentive
 curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley’s, in spite of the
 smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
 objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
 to mr. darcy were by means over. miss darcy, on her brother’s
 entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he
 was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
 as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. miss
 bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
 first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--
 
“pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?
 they must be great loss to _your_ family.”
 
in darcy’s presence she dared not mention wickham’s name: but elizabeth
 instantly comprehended that was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
 various recollections connected with him gave her moment’s distress;
 but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
 presently answered the question in tolerably disengaged tone. while
 she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her darcy with heightened
 complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
 confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. had miss bingley known what
 pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
 refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
 elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of man to whom she believed
 her partial, to make her betray sensibility which might injure her in
 darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
 and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with
 that corps. not syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy’s
 meditated elopement. to creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
 was possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley’s connections
 her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
 which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
 hereafter her own. had certainly formed such plan; and without
 meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
 bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
 for the welfare of his friend.
 
elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
 as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
 wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
 to speak any more. her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
 recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which
 had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have
 fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.
 
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
 mentioned; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage,
 miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth’s
 person, behaviour, and dress. but georgiana would not join her. her
 brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment
 could not err; and had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave
 georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and
 amiable. when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley could not help
 repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.
 
“how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr. darcy,” she cried: “i
 never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.
 she is grown so brown and coarse! louisa and i were agreeing that we
 should not have known her again.”
 
however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address, contented
 himself with coolly replying, that perceived other alteration than
 her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
 summer.
 
“for my own part,” she rejoined, “i must confess that i never could see
 any beauty in her. her face is too thin; her complexion has no
 brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. her nose wants
 character; there is nothing marked in its lines. her teeth are
 tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
 have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive anything
 extraordinary in them. they have sharp, shrewish look, which i do not
 like at all; and in her air altogether, there is self-sufficiency
 without fashion, which is intolerable.”
 
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not
 the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
 wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
 success she expected. was resolutely silent, however; and, from a
 determination of making him speak, she continued,--
 
“i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all
 were to find that she was reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect
 your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, ‘_she_
 beauty! i should as soon call her mother wit.’ but afterwards she
 seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
 one time.”
 
“yes,” replied darcy, who could contain himself longer, “but _that_
 was only when i first knew her; for it is many months since i have
 considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”
 
then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
 having forced him to say what gave one any pain but herself.
 
mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
 visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
 both. the looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
 except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. they talked
 of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but
 himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of
 him, and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s
 beginning the subject.

chapter xlvi.

elizabeth had been good deal disappointed in not finding letter from
 jane on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had been
 renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on
 the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
 receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
 it had been mis-sent elsewhere. elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
 jane had written the direction remarkably ill.
 
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
 uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
 themselves. the one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been
 written five days ago. the beginning contained an account of all their
 little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
 but the latter half, which was dated day later, and written in evident
 agitation, gave more important intelligence. it was to this effect:--
 
“since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of a
 most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming you--be
 assured that we are all well. what i have to say relates to poor lydia.
 an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
 from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland
 with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham! imagine our
 surprise. to kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. i am
 very, very sorry. so imprudent match on both sides! but i am willing
 to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
 thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him, but this step (and
 let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. his choice is
 disinterested at least, for must know my father can give her nothing.
 our poor mother is sadly grieved. my father bears it better. how
 thankful am i, that we never let them know what has been said against
 him; we must forget it ourselves. they were off saturday night about
 twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
 eight. the express was sent off directly. my dear lizzy, they must have
 passed within ten miles of us. colonel forster gives us reason to expect
 him here soon. lydia left few lines for his wife, informing her of
 their intention. i must conclude, for i cannot be long from my poor
 mother. i am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but i hardly
 know what i have written.”
 
without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
 what she felt, elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
 other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
 had been written day later than the conclusion of the first.
 
“by this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; i
 wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
 head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent. dearest
 lizzy, i hardly know what i would write, but i have bad news for you,
 and it cannot be delayed. imprudent as marriage between mr. wickham
 and our poor lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
 taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
 to scotland. colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the
 day before, not many hours after the express. though lydia’s short
 letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to gretna
 green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w.
 never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which was repeated
 to colonel f., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from b.,
 intending to trace their route. did trace them easily to clapham, but
 farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a
 hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom.
 all that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the
 london road. i know not what to think. after making every possible
 inquiry on that side of london, colonel f. came on into hertfordshire,
 anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in barnet
 and hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to
 pass through. with the kindest concern came on to longbourn, and
 broke his apprehensions to us in manner most creditable to his heart.
 i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f.; but one can throw any
 blame on them. our distress, my dear lizzy, is very great. my father and
 mother believe the worst, but i cannot think so ill of him. many
 circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married
 privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_
 could form such design against young woman of lydia’s connections,
 which is not likely, can i suppose her so lost to everything?
 impossible! i grieve to find, however, that colonel f. is not disposed
 to depend upon their marriage: shook his head when i expressed my
 hopes, and said feared w. was not man to be trusted. my poor mother
 is really ill, and keeps her room. could she exert herself, it would be
 better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in
 my life saw him so affected. poor kitty has anger for having concealed
 their attachment; but as it was matter of confidence, one cannot
 wonder. i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared
 something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is
 over, shall i own that i long for your return? i am not so selfish,
 however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. adieu! i take up my pen
 again to do, what i have just told you i would not; but circumstances
 are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as
 soon as possible. i know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that i am not
 afraid of requesting it, though i have still something more to ask of
 the former. my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly,
 to try to discover her. what means to do, i am sure i know not; but
 his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the
 best and safest way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton
 again to-morrow evening. in such an exigence my uncle’s advice and
 assistance would be everything in the world; will immediately
 comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness.”
 
“oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried elizabeth, darting from her seat
 as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
 moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
 opened by servant, and mr. darcy appeared. her pale face and
 impetuous manner made him start, and before could recover himself
 enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia’s
 situation, hastily exclaimed, “i beg your pardon, but i must leave you.
 i must find mr. gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;
 i have not an instant to lose.”
 
“good god! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than
 politeness; then recollecting himself, “i will not detain you minute;
 but let me, or let the servant, go after mr. and mrs. gardiner. you are
 not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”
 
elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
 little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. calling back
 the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
 accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
 mistress home instantly.
 
on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
 looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her,
 or to refrain from saying, in tone of gentleness and commiseration,
 “let call your maid. is there nothing you could take to give you
 present relief? glass of wine; shall i get you one? you are very ill.”
 
“no, i thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “there
 is nothing the matter with me. i am quite well, i am only distressed by
 some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn.”
 
she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for few minutes could
 not speak another word. darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
 something indistinctly of his
 
[illustration:
 
“i have not an instant to lose”
 ]
 
concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. at length she spoke
 again. “i have just had letter from jane, with such dreadful news. it
 cannot be concealed from anyone. my youngest sister has left all her
 friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of mr.
 wickham. they are gone off together from brighton. _you_ know him too
 well to doubt the rest. she has money, connections, nothing that
 can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”
 
darcy was fixed in astonishment.
 
“when i consider,” she added, in yet more agitated voice, “that _i_
 might have prevented it! _i_ who knew what was. had i but explained
 some part of it only--some part of what i learnt, to my own family! had
 his character been known, this could not have happened. but it is all,
 all too late now.”
 
“i am grieved, indeed,” cried darcy: “grieved--shocked. but is it
 certain, absolutely certain?”
 
“oh, yes! they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced
 almost to london, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to
 scotland.”
 
“and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”
 
“my father has gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle’s
 immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour. but
 nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done. how is
 such man to be worked on? how are they even to be discovered? i have
 not the smallest hope. it is every way horrible!”
 
darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
 
“when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had i known what
 i ought, what i dared to do! but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too
 much. wretched, wretched mistake!”
 
darcy made answer. seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
 and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
 gloomy. elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. her power
 was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such proof of family
 weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. she could neither
 wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
 consolatory to her bosom, afforded palliation of her distress. it
 was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
 wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
 him, as now, when all love must be vain.
 
but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. lydia--the
 humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up
 every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
 elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after pause of
 several minutes, was only recalled to sense of her situation by the
 voice of her companion, who, in manner which, though it spoke
 compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--
 
“i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i anything
 to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.
 would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,
 that might offer consolation to such distress! but i will not torment
 you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
 this unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister’s having the
 pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day.”
 
“oh, yes! be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy. say that
 urgent business calls us home immediately. conceal the unhappy truth as
 long as it is possible. i know it cannot be long.”
 
readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for
 her distress, wished it happier conclusion than there was at present
 reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with
 only one serious parting look, went away.
 
as quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
 should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
 marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a
 retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
 contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
 feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
 formerly have rejoiced in its termination.
 
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth’s
 change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. but if
 otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
 unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
 first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
 exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
 somewhat of trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham,
 and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other
 less interesting mode of attachment. be that as it may, she saw him go
 with regret; and in this early example of what lydia’s infamy must
 produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
 business. never since reading jane’s second letter had she entertained a
 hope of wickham’s meaning to marry her. one but jane, she thought,
 could flatter herself with such an expectation. surprise was the least
 of all her feelings on this development. while the contents of the first
 letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,
 that wickham should marry girl whom it was impossible could marry
 for money; and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
 incomprehensible. but now it was all too natural. for such an attachment
 as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
 suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
 intention of marriage, she had difficulty in believing that neither
 her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
 prey.
 
she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that
 lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that lydia had
 wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. sometimes one
 officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
 raised them in her opinion. her affections had been continually
 fluctuating, but never without an object. the mischief of neglect and
 mistaken indulgence towards such girl--oh! how acutely did she now
 feel it!
 
she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
 share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
 family so deranged; father absent, mother incapable of exertion, and
 requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
 could be done for lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost
 importance, and till entered the room the misery of her impatience
 was severe. mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
 by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but
 satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
 cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
 the postscript of the last with trembling energy. though lydia had never
 been favourite with them, mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be
 deeply affected. not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
 the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr. gardiner readily
 promised every assistance in his power. elizabeth, though expecting no
 less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
 by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily
 settled. they were to be off as soon as possible. “but what is to be
 done about pemberley?” cried mrs. gardiner. “john told us mr. darcy was
 here when you sent for us;--was it so?”
 
“yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
 _that_ is all settled.”
 
“what is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
 prepare. “and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
 truth? oh, that i knew how it was!”
 
but wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the
 hurry and confusion of the following hour. had elizabeth been at leisure
 to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
 impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
 business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
 be written to all their friends at lambton, with false excuses for their
 sudden departure. an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr.
 gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing
 remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of
 the morning, found herself, in shorter space of time than she could
 have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn.

chapter xlvii.

“i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they
 drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, i am much
 more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
 matter. it appears to so very unlikely that any young man should form
 such design against girl who is by means unprotected or
 friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel’s family, that i
 am strongly inclined to hope the best. could expect that her friends
 would not step forward? could expect to be noticed again by the
 regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster? his temptation is
 not adequate to the risk.”
 
“do you really think so?” cried elizabeth, brightening up for moment.
 
“upon my word,” said mrs. gardiner, “i begin to be of your uncle’s
 opinion. it is really too great violation of decency, honour, and
 interest, for him to be guilty of it. i cannot think so very ill of
 wickham. can you, yourself, lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe
 him capable of it?”
 
“not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. but of every other neglect
 i can believe him capable. if, indeed, it should be so! but i dare not
 hope it. why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the
 case?”
 
“in the first place,” replied mr. gardiner, “there is absolute proof
 that they are not gone to scotland.”
 
“oh, but their removing from the chaise into hackney coach is such a
 presumption! and, besides, traces of them were to be found on the
 barnet road.”
 
“well, then,--supposing them to be in london--they may be there, though
 for the purpose of concealment, for more exceptionable purpose. it is
 not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
 might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
 expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland.”
 
“but why all this secrecy? why any fear of detection? why must their
 marriage be private? oh, no, no--this is not likely. his most particular
 friend, you see by jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending
 to marry her. wickham will never marry woman without some money. he
 cannot afford it. and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she
 beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake
 forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? as to what
 restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
 dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know
 nothing of the effects that such step might produce. but as to your
 other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good. lydia has no
 brothers to step forward; and might imagine, from my father’s
 behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention has ever
 seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
 do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
 such matter.”
 
“but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,
 as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”
 
“it does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied elizabeth, with
 tears in her eyes, “that sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such
 point should admit of doubt. but, really, i know not what to say.
 perhaps i am not doing her justice. but she is very young: she has never
 been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
 nay, for twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
 and vanity. she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
 and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
 since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love,
 flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. she has been doing
 everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
 greater--what shall i call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which
 are naturally lively enough. and we all know that wickham has every
 charm of person and address that can captivate woman.”
 
“but you see that jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of
 wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”
 
“of whom does jane ever think ill? and who is there, whatever might be
 their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
 till it were proved against them? but jane knows, as well as i do, what
 wickham really is. we both know that has been profligate in every
 sense of the word; that has neither integrity nor honour; that is
 as false and deceitful as is insinuating.”
 
“and do you really know all this?” cried mrs. gardiner, whose curiosity
 as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
 
“i do, indeed,” replied elizabeth, colouring. “i told you the other day
 of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
 longbourn, heard in what manner spoke of the man who had behaved with
 such forbearance and liberality towards him. and there are other
 circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
 relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless. from
 what said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see proud,
 reserved, disagreeable girl. yet knew to the contrary himself. he
 must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
 her.”
 
“but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
 and jane seem so well to understand?”
 
“oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. till i was in kent, and saw
 so much both of mr. darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam, i was
 ignorant of the truth myself. and when i returned home the ----shire
 was to leave meryton in week or fortnight’s time. as that was the
 case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it
 necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
 apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the
 neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? and even when it
 was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster, the necessity of
 opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. that _she_ could
 be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. that such a
 consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
 enough from my thoughts.”
 
“when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had reason, i
 suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”
 
“not the slightest. i can remember symptom of affection on either
 side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
 that ours is not family on which it could be thrown away. when first
 entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
 were. every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for
 the first two months: but never distinguished _her_ by any particular
 attention; and, consequently, after moderate period of extravagant and
 wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
 who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”
 
it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
 to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by
 its repeated discussion, other could detain them from it long, during
 the whole of the journey. from elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.
 fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could
 find interval of ease or forgetfulness.
 
they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
 the road, reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day. it was comfort
 to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long
 expectations.
 
the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of chaise, were standing
 on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
 carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
 faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in variety of
 capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.
 
elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them hasty kiss,
 hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running downstairs from
 her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.
 
elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
 eyes of both, lost not moment in asking whether anything had been
 heard of the fugitives.
 
“not yet,” replied jane. “but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope
 everything will be well.”
 
“is my father in town?”
 
“yes, went on tuesday, as i wrote you word.”
 
“and have you heard from him often?”
 
“we have heard only once. wrote few lines on wednesday, to say
 that had arrived in safety, and to give his directions, which i
 particularly begged him to do. merely added, that should not write
 again, till had something of importance to mention.”
 
“and my mother--how is she? how are you all?”
 
“my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly
 shaken. she is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
 all. she does not yet leave her dressing-room. mary and kitty, thank
 heaven! are quite well.”
 
“but you--how are you?” cried elizabeth. “you look pale. how much you
 must have gone through!”
 
her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
 conversation, which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were
 engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of
 the whole party. jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
 thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.
 
when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth
 had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
 found that jane had intelligence to give. the sanguine hope of good,
 however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
 deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
 every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father,
 to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.
 
mrs. bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after few minutes’
 conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
 tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
 conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
 blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
 errors of her daughter must be principally owing.
 
“if i had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to brighton
 with all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear lydia
 had nobody to take care of her. why did the forsters ever let her go out
 of their sight? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
 side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such thing, if she had
 been well looked after. i always thought they were very unfit to have
 the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am. poor, dear
 child! and now here’s mr. bennet gone away, and i know will fight
 wickham, wherever meets him, and then will be killed, and what is
 to become of us all? the collinses will turn us out, before is cold
 in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what
 we shall do.”
 
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr. gardiner, after
 general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
 that meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist mr.
 bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.
 
“do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be
 prepared for the worst, there is occasion to look on it as certain.
 it is not quite week since they left brighton. in few days more, we
 may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
 and have design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
 lost. as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him
 come home with to gracechurch street, and then we may consult
 together as to what is to be done.”
 
“oh, my dear brother,” replied mrs. bennet, “that is exactly what i
 could most wish for. and now do, when you get to town, find them out,
 wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
 marry. and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
 tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
 after they are married. and, above all things, keep mr. bennet from
 fighting. tell him what dreadful state i am in--that i am frightened
 out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,
 such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my
 heart, that i can get rest by night nor by day. and tell my dear
 lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,
 for she does not know which are the best warehouses. oh, brother, how
 kind you are! i know you will contrive it all.”
 
but mr. gardiner, though assured her again of his earnest endeavours
 in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
 her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till
 dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
 housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.
 
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was real
 occasion for such seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
 oppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
 tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
 better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
 most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
 subject.
 
in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been
 too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
 before. one came from her books, and the other from her toilette. the
 faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and change was visible
 in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
 which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more
 of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty. as for mary, she was
 mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth, with countenance
 of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--
 
“this is most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
 but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
 each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”
 
then perceiving in elizabeth inclination of replying, she added,
 “unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful
 lesson:--that loss of virtue in female is irretrievable, that one
 false step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is less
 brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in
 her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”
 
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
 make any reply. mary, however, continued to console herself with such
 kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.
 
in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an
 hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
 opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to
 satisfy. after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
 of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss
 bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
 the subject by saying, “but tell all and everything about it which i
 have not already heard. give further particulars. what did colonel
 forster say? had they apprehension of anything before the elopement
 took place? they must have seen them together for ever.”
 
“colonel forster did own that had often suspected some partiality,
 especially on lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. i am so
 grieved for him. his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. he
 _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before had
 any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension
 first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”
 
“and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry? did know of
 their intending to go off? had colonel forster seen denny himself?”
 
“yes; but when questioned by _him_, denny denied knowing anything of
 their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. did not
 repeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ i am
 inclined to hope might have been misunderstood before.”
 
“and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
 doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?”
 
“how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? i felt a
 little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in
 marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
 right. my father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
 imprudent match it must be. kitty then owned, with very natural
 triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia’s last letter
 she had prepared her for such step. she had known, it seems, of their
 being in love with each other many weeks.”
 
“but not before they went to brighton?”
 
“no, i believe not.”
 
“and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself? does he
 know his real character?”
 
“i must confess that did not speak so well of wickham as formerly
 did. believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad
 affair has taken place, it is said that left meryton greatly in debt:
 but i hope this may be false.”
 
“oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
 this could not have happened!”
 
“perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.
 
“but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what
 their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”
 
“we acted with the best intentions.”
 
“could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia’s note to his
 wife?”
 
“he brought it with him for us to see.”
 
jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth. these
 were the contents:--
 
/* nind “my dear harriet, */
 
“you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help
 laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am
 missed. i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with
 who, i shall think you simpleton, for there is but one man in the
 world i love, and is an angel. i should never be happy without
 him, so think it harm to be off. you need not send them word at
 longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
 surprise the greater when i write to them, and sign my name lydia
 wickham. what good joke it will be! i can hardly write for
 laughing. pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my
 engagement, and dancing with him to-night. tell him i hope will
 excuse when knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at
 the next ball we meet with great pleasure. i shall send for my
 clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to
 mend great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed
 up. good-bye. give my love to colonel forster. i hope you will
 drink to our good journey.
 
“your affectionate friend,
 
“lydia bennet.”
 

“oh, thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!” cried elizabeth when she had
 finished it. “what letter is this, to be written at such moment! but
 at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.
 whatever might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
 _scheme_ of infamy. my poor father! how must have felt it!”
 
“i never saw anyone so shocked. could not speak word for full ten
 minutes. my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
 such confusion!”
 
“oh, jane,” cried elizabeth, “was there servant belonging to it who
 did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”
 
“i do not know: i hope there was. but to be guarded at such time is
 very difficult. my mother was in hysterics; and though i endeavoured to
 give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much
 as i might have done. but the horror of what might possibly happen
 almost took from my faculties.”
 
“your attendance upon her has been too much for you. you do not look
 well. oh that i had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
 upon yourself alone.”
 
“mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
 fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.
 kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much that her hours of
 repose should not be broken in on. my aunt philips came to longbourn on
 tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
 thursday with me. she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
 lucas has been very kind: she walked here on wednesday morning to
 condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
 they could be of use to us.”
 
“she had better have stayed at home,” cried elizabeth: “perhaps she
 _meant_ well, but, under such misfortune as this, one cannot see too
 little of one’s neighbours. assistance is impossible; condolence,
 insufferable. let them triumph over us at distance, and be satisfied.”
 
she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
 intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
 
“he meant, i believe,” replied jane, “to go to epsom, the place where
 they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could
 be made out from them. his principal object must be to discover the
 number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham. it had come
 with fare from london; and as thought the circumstance of a
 gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be
 remarked, meant to make inquiries at clapham. if could anyhow
 discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
 determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
 to find out the stand and number of the coach. i do not know of any
 other designs that had formed; but was in such hurry to be gone,
 and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding
 out even so much as this.”

the whole party were in hopes of letter from mr. bennet the next
 morning, but the post came in without bringing single line from him.
 his family knew him to be, on all common occasions, most negligent and
 dilatory correspondent; but at such time they had hoped for exertion.
 they were forced to conclude, that had pleasing intelligence to
 send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. mr.
 gardiner had waited only for the letters before set off.
 
when was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
 information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,
 to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn as soon as could, to
 the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
 security for her husband’s not being killed in duel.
 
mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire few
 days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
 her nieces. she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet, and was a
 great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. their other aunt also
 visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
 cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
 reporting some fresh instance of wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,
 she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
 them.
 
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
 before, had been almost an angel of light. was declared to be in debt
 to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
 the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.
 everybody declared that was the wickedest young man in the world; and
 everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
 appearance of his goodness. elizabeth, though she did not credit above
 half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
 her sister’s ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still
 less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
 come, when, if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before
 entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
 news of them.
 
mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a
 letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival had immediately
 found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street.
 that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but
 without gaining any satisfactory information; and that was now
 determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr. bennet
 thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
 coming to london, before they procured lodgings. mr. gardiner himself
 did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was
 eager in it, meant to assist him in pursuing it. added, that mr.
 bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london, and
 promised to write again very soon. there was also postscript to this
 effect:--
 
“i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if
 possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,
 whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
 know in what part of the town has now concealed himself. if there
 were anyone that one could apply to, with probability of gaining such
 clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. at present we have
 nothing to guide us. colonel forster will, i dare say, do everything in
 his power to satisfy us on this head. but, on second thoughts, perhaps
 lizzy could tell us what relations has now living better than any
 other person.”
 
elizabeth was at loss to understand from whence this deference for
 her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
 information of so satisfactory nature as the compliment deserved.
 
she had never heard of his having had any relations, except father
 and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. it was possible,
 however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to
 give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting
 it, the application was something to look forward to.
 
every day at longbourn was now day of anxiety; but the most anxious
 part of each was when the post was expected. the arrival of letters was
 the first grand object of every morning’s impatience. through letters,
 whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every
 succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.
 
but before they heard again from mr. gardiner, letter arrived for
 their father, from different quarter, from mr. collins; which, as jane
 had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
 she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
 letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. it was as
 follows:--
 
/* “my dear sir, */
 
“i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
 in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
 suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by letter
 from hertfordshire. be assured, my dear sir, that mrs. collins and
 myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable
 family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
 kind, because proceeding from cause which time can remove. no
 arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
 misfortune; or that may comfort you, under circumstance that
 must be, of all others, most afflicting to parent’s mind. the
 death of your daughter would have been blessing in comparison of
 this. and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
 suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
 of behaviour in your
 
[illustration:
 
“to whom i have related the affair”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
daughter has proceeded from faulty degree of indulgence; though,
 at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet,
 i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally
 bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an
 age. howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in
 which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins, but likewise by
 lady catherine and her daughter, to whom i have related the affair.
 they agree with in apprehending that this false step in one
 daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for
 who, as lady catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect
 themselves with such family? and this consideration leads me,
 moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on certain
 event of last november; for had it been otherwise, i must have been
 involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. let advise you, then,
 my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off
 your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to
 reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.
 
“i am, dear sir,” etc., etc.
 
mr. gardiner did not write again, till had received an answer from
 colonel forster; and then had nothing of pleasant nature to send.
 it was not known that wickham had single relation with whom kept up
 any connection, and it was certain that had near one living. his
 former acquaintance had been numerous; but since had been in the
 militia, it did not appear that was on terms of particular friendship
 with any of them. there was one, therefore, who could be pointed out
 as likely to give any news of him. and in the wretched state of his own
 finances, there was very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
 his fear of discovery by lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired
 that had left gaming debts behind him to very considerable amount.
 colonel forster believed that more than thousand pounds would be
 necessary to clear his expenses at brighton. owed good deal in the
 town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. mr. gardiner
 did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family;
 jane heard them with horror. “a gamester!” she cried. “this is wholly
 unexpected; i had not an idea of it.”
 
mr. gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their
 father at home on the following day, which was saturday. rendered
 spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, had yielded to
 his brother-in-law’s entreaty that would return to his family and
 leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
 for continuing their pursuit. when mrs. bennet was told of this, she did
 not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
 what her anxiety for his life had been before.
 
“what! is coming home, and without poor lydia?” she cried. “sure he
 will not leave london before has found them. who is to fight wickham,
 and make him marry her, if comes away?”
 
as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
 and her children should go to london at the same time that mr. bennet
 came from it. the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
 journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.
 
mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
 derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
 his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
 and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed, of
 their being followed by letter from him, had ended in nothing.
 elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
 pemberley.
 
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
 the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
 fairly conjectured from _that_,--though elizabeth, who was by this time
 tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
 that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of
 lydia’s infamy somewhat better. it would have spared her, she thought,
 one sleepless night out of two.
 
when mr. bennet arrived, had all the appearance of his usual
 philosophic composure. said as little as had ever been in the
 habit of saying; made mention of the business that had taken him
 away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
 it.
 
it was not till the afternoon, when joined them at tea, that
 elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
 expressing her sorrow for what must have endured, replied, “say
 nothing of that. who should suffer but myself? it has been my own doing,
 and i ought to feel it.”
 
“you must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied elizabeth.
 
“you may well warn against such an evil. human nature is so prone to
 fall into it! no, lizzy, let once in my life feel how much i have
 been to blame. i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
 it will pass away soon enough.”
 
“do you suppose them to be in london?”
 
“yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”
 
“and lydia used to want to go to london,” added kitty.
 
“she is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there
 will probably be of some duration.”
 
then, after short silence, continued, “lizzy, i bear you no
 ill-will for being justified in your advice to last may, which,
 considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”
 
they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s
 tea.
 
“this is parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an
 elegance to misfortune! another day i will do the same; i will sit in my
 library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
 i can,--or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away.”
 
“i am not going to run away, papa,” said kitty, fretfully. “if _i_
 should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia.”
 
“_you_ go to brighton! i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne,
 for fifty pounds! no, kitty, i have at least learnt to be cautious, and
 you will feel the effects of it. officer is ever to enter my house
 again, nor even to pass through the village. balls will be absolutely
 prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. and you are
 never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten
 minutes of every day in rational manner.”
 
kitty, who took all these threats in serious light, began to cry.
 
“well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. if you are good
 girl for the next ten years, i will take you to review at the end of
 them.”

chapter xlix.

two days after mr. bennet’s return, as jane and elizabeth were walking
 together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
 coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their
 mother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,
 when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, “i beg your pardon,
 madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some
 good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask.”
 
“what do you mean, hill? we have heard nothing from town.”
 
“dear madam,” cried mrs. hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know
 there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner? has been here
 this half hour, and master has had letter.”
 
away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. they
 ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
 library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
 seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the
 butler, who said,--
 
“if you are looking for my master, ma’am, is walking towards the
 little copse.”
 
upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
 and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
 pursuing his way towards small wood on one side of the paddock.
 
jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
 elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
 came up with him, and eagerly cried out,--
 
“oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”
 
“yes, i have had letter from him by express.”
 
“well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”
 
“what is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from
 his pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”
 
elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. jane now came up.
 
“read it aloud,” said their father, “for i hardly know myself what it is
 about.”
 
/* right “gracechurch street, _monday, august 2_. */
 
“my dear brother,
 
“at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
 as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction. soon after
 you left on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what
 part of london they were. the particulars i reserve till we meet.
 it is enough to know they are discovered: i have seen them
 both----”
 
[illustration:
 
“but perhaps you would like to read it”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 
“then it is as i always hoped,” cried jane: “they are married!”
 
elizabeth read on: “i have seen them both. they are not married,
 nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
 willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on
 your side, i hope it will not be long before they are. all that is
 required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
 equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
 children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
 moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
 life, one hundred pounds per annum. these are conditions which,
 considering everything, i had hesitation in complying with, as
 far as i thought myself privileged, for you. i shall send this by
 express, that time may be lost in bringing your answer. you
 will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr. wickham’s
 circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
 be. the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to
 say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
 discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
 if, as i conclude will be the case, you send full powers to act
 in your name throughout the whole of this business, i will
 immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing proper
 settlement. there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
 to town again; therefore stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on
 my diligence and care. send back your answer as soon as you can,
 and be careful to write explicitly. we have judged it best that my
 niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will
 approve. she comes to us to-day. i shall write again as soon as
 anything more is determined on. yours, etc.
 
“edw. gardiner.”
 
“is it possible?” cried elizabeth, when she had finished. “can it be
 possible that will marry her?”
 
“wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her
 sister. “my dear father, i congratulate you.”
 
“and have you answered the letter?” said elizabeth.
 
“no; but it must be done soon.”
 
most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose more time before he
 wrote.
 
“oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.
 consider how important every moment is in such case.”
 
“let write for you,” said jane, “if you dislike the trouble
 yourself.”
 
“i dislike it very much,” replied; “but it must be done.”
 
and so saying, turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
 
“and--may i ask?” said elizabeth; “but the terms, i suppose, must be
 complied with.”
 
“complied with! i am only ashamed of his asking so little.”
 
“and they _must_ marry! yet is _such_ man.”
 
“yes, yes, they must marry. there is nothing else to be done. but there
 are two things that i want very much to know:--one is, how much money
 your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how i am ever
 to pay him.”
 
“money! my uncle!” cried jane, “what do you mean, sir?”
 
“i mean that man in his proper senses would marry lydia on so slight
 temptation as one hundred year during my life, and fifty after i am
 gone.”
 
“that is very true,” said elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me
 before. his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! oh,
 it must be my uncle’s doings! generous, good man, i am afraid has
 distressed himself. small sum could not do all this.”
 
“no,” said her father. “wickham’s fool if takes her with farthing
 less than ten thousand pounds: i should be sorry to think so ill of him,
 in the very beginning of our relationship.”
 
“ten thousand pounds! heaven forbid! how is half such sum to be
 repaid?”
 
mr. bennet made answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued
 silent till they reached the house. their father then went to the
 library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
 
“and they are really to be married!” cried elizabeth, as soon as they
 were by themselves. “how strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be
 thankful. that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
 and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! oh, lydia!”
 
“i comfort myself with thinking,” replied jane, “that certainly would
 not marry lydia, if had not real regard for her. though our kind
 uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten
 thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. has children
 of his own, and may have more. how could spare half ten thousand
 pounds?”
 
“if we are ever able to learn what wickham’s debts have been,” said
 elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
 exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them, because wickham has
 not sixpence of his own. the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
 requited. their taking her home, and affording her their personal
 protection and countenance, is such sacrifice to her advantage as
 years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. by this time she is
 actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now,
 she will never deserve to be happy! what meeting for her, when she
 first sees my aunt!”
 
“we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said
 jane: “i hope and trust they will yet be happy. his consenting to marry
 her is proof, i will believe, that is come to right way of
 thinking. their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself
 they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational manner, as may in
 time make their past imprudence forgotten.”
 
“their conduct has been such,” replied elizabeth, “as neither you, nor
 i, nor anybody, can ever forget. it is useless to talk of it.”
 
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
 perfectly ignorant of what had happened. they went to the library,
 therefore, and asked their father whether would not wish them to make
 it known to her. was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly
 replied,--
 
“just as you please.”
 
“may we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”
 
“take whatever you like, and get away.”
 
elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs
 together. mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet: one communication
 would, therefore, do for all. after slight preparation for good news,
 the letter was read aloud. mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself. as
 soon as jane had read mr. gardiner’s hope of lydia’s being soon married,
 her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
 exuberance. she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she
 had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. to know that her daughter
 would be married was enough. she was disturbed by fear for her
 felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
 
“my dear, dear lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! she will
 be married! i shall see her again! she will be married at sixteen! my
 good, kind brother! i knew how it would be--i knew would manage
 everything. how i long to see her! and to see dear wickham too! but the
 clothes, the wedding clothes! i will write to my sister gardiner about
 them directly. lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
 much will give her. stay, stay, i will go myself. ring the bell,
 kitty, for hill. i will put on my things in moment. my dear, dear
 lydia! how merry we shall be together when we meet!”
 
her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
 these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr.
 gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.
 
“for we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in great
 measure to his kindness. we are persuaded that has pledged himself to
 assist mr. wickham with money.”
 
“well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but
 her own uncle? if had not had family of his own, i and my children
 must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
 ever had anything from him except few presents. well! i am so happy.
 in short time, i shall have daughter married. mrs. wickham! how well
 it sounds! and she was only sixteen last june. my dear jane, i am in
 such flutter, that i am sure i can’t write; so i will dictate, and you
 write for me. we will settle with your father about the money
 afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”
 
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
 cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
 not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
 father was at leisure to be consulted. one day’s delay, she observed,
 would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
 so obstinate as usual. other schemes, too, came into her head.
 
“i will go to meryton,” said she, “as soon as i am dressed, and tell the
 good, good news to my sister philips. and as i come back, i can call on
 lady lucas and mrs. long. kitty, run down and order the carriage. an
 airing would do great deal of good, i am sure. girls, can i do
 anything for you in meryton? oh! here comes hill. my dear hill, have you
 heard the good news? miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall
 all have bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”
 
mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy. elizabeth received her
 congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
 refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. poor lydia’s
 situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was worse, she
 had need to be thankful. she felt it so; and though, in looking forward,
 neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly
 expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only
 two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.

“the spiteful old ladies”
 
[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]
 



chapter l.
 

[illustration]
 
mr. bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
 instead of spending his whole income, had laid by an annual sum, for
 the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
 him. now wished it more than ever. had done his duty in that
 respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of
 honour or credit could now be purchased for her. the satisfaction of
 prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to
 be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.
 
was seriously concerned that cause of so little advantage to anyone
 should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he
 was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
 and to discharge the obligation as soon as could.
 
when first mr. bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
 useless; for, of course, they were to have son. this was to join
 in cutting off the entail, as soon as should be of age, and the widow
 and younger children would by that means be provided for. five daughters
 successively entered the world, but yet the was to come; and mrs.
 bennet, for many years after lydia’s birth, had been certain that he
 would. this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
 late to be saving. mrs. bennet had turn for economy; and her
 husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
 income.
 
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and
 the children. but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
 latter depended on the will of the parents. this was one point, with
 regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr. bennet
 could have hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. in
 terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
 expressed most concisely, then delivered on paper his perfect
 approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
 engagements that had been made for him. had never before supposed
 that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
 done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
 arrangement. would scarcely be ten pounds year the loser, by the
 hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
 allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
 through her mother’s hands, lydia’s expenses had been very little within
 that sum.
 
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
 another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have
 as little trouble in the business as possible. when the first transports
 of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
 naturally returned to all his former indolence. his letter was soon
 despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, was quick in
 its execution. begged to know further particulars of what was
 indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia to send any
 message to her.
 
the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
 speed through the neighbourhood. it was borne in the latter with decent
 philosophy. to be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of
 conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the
 happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant
 farm-house. but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
 good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from
 all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit
 in this change of circumstances, because with such husband her misery
 was considered certain.
 
it was fortnight since mrs. bennet had been down stairs, but on this
 happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
 spirits oppressively high. sentiment of shame gave damp to her
 triumph. the marriage of daughter, which had been the first object of
 her wishes since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
 accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
 attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
 servants. she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
 proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering
 what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
 importance.
 
“haye park might do,” said she, “if the gouldings would quit it, or the
 great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is
 too far off. i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
 purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful.”
 
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
 servants remained. but when they had withdrawn, said to her, “mrs.
 bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your and
 daughter, let us come to right understanding. into _one_ house in this
 neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. i will not encourage the
 imprudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn.”
 
long dispute followed this declaration; but mr. bennet was firm: it
 soon led to another; and mrs. bennet found, with amazement and horror,
 that her husband would not advance guinea to buy clothes for his
 daughter. protested that she should receive from him mark of
 affection whatever on the occasion. mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend
 it. that his anger could be carried to such point of inconceivable
 resentment as to refuse his daughter privilege, without which her
 marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
 possible. she was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new
 clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of
 shame at her eloping and living with wickham fortnight before they
 took place.
 
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
 the moment, been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for
 her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
 termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
 unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
 spot.
 
she had fear of its spreading farther, through his means. there were
 few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
 but at the same time there was one whose knowledge of sister’s
 frailty would have mortified her so much. not, however, from any fear of
 disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there
 seemed gulf impassable between them. had lydia’s marriage been
 concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
 mr. darcy would connect himself with family, where to every other
 objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest
 kind with the man whom so justly scorned.
 
from such connection she could not wonder that should shrink. the
 wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
 feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
 blow as this. she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
 hardly knew of what. she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
 longer hope to be benefited by it. she wanted to hear of him, when there
 seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. she was convinced that
 she could have been happy with him, when it was longer likely they
 should meet.
 
what triumph for him, as she often thought, could know that the
 proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now
 have been gladly and gratefully received! was as generous, she
 doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. but while was mortal,
 there must be triumph.
 
she began now to comprehend that was exactly the man who, in
 disposition and talents, would most suit her. his understanding and
 temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. it
 was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease
 and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
 and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
 have received benefit of greater importance.
 
but such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
 connubial felicity really was. an union of different tendency, and
 precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
 family.
 
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she
 could not imagine. but how little of permanent happiness could belong to
 couple who were only brought together because their passions were
 stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
 
mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. to mr. bennet’s
 acknowledgments briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
 promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
 that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. the principal
 purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr. wickham had resolved
 on quitting the militia.
 
“it was greatly my wish that should do so,” added, “as soon as his
 marriage was fixed on. and i think you will agree with me, in
 considering removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his
 account and my niece’s. it is mr. wickham’s intention to go into the
 regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are
 able and willing to assist him in the army. has the promise of an
 ensigncy in general----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. it is
 an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. he
 promises fairly; and i hope among different people, where they may each
 have character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. i have
 written to colonel forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
 and to request that will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham
 in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which i have
 pledged myself. and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
 similar assurances to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin
 list, according to his information? has given in all his debts; i
 hope at least has not deceived us. haggerston has our directions, and
 all will be completed in week. they will then join his regiment,
 unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from mrs.
 gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
 leaves the south. she is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
 you and her mother.--yours, etc.
 
“e. gardiner.”
 
mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham’s
 removal from the ----shire, as clearly as mr. gardiner could do. but
 mrs. bennet was not so well pleased with it. lydia’s being settled in
 the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
 company, for she had by means given up her plan of their residing in
 hertfordshire, was severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
 pity that lydia should be taken from regiment where she was acquainted
 with everybody, and had so many favourites.
 
“she is so fond of mrs. forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking
 to send her away! and there are several of the young men, too, that she
 likes very much. the officers may not be so pleasant in general----’s
 regiment.”
 
his daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being
 admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,
 received at first an absolute negative. but jane and elizabeth, who
 agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and
 consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
 urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
 and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that was
 prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. and their
 mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show
 her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
 the north. when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
 sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon
 as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn. elizabeth
 was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such scheme;
 and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
 would have been the last object of her wishes.

chapter li.
 

[illustration]
 
their sister’s wedding-day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her
 probably more than she felt for herself. the carriage was sent to meet
 them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. their arrival
 was dreaded by the elder miss bennets--and jane more especially, who
 gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
 been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
 must endure.
 
they came. the family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive
 them. smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet, as the carriage drove up to
 the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
 anxious, uneasy.
 
lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
 she ran into the room. her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
 welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
 wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an
 alacrity which showed doubt of their happiness.
 
their reception from mr. bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
 so cordial. his countenance rather gained in austerity; and scarcely
 opened his lips. the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
 enough to provoke him.
 
elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked. lydia was
 lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. she turned
 from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at
 length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of
 some little alteration in it, and observed, with laugh, that it was a
 great while since she had been there.
 
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners
 were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been
 exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
 claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. elizabeth
 had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat
 down, resolving within herself to draw limits in future to the
 impudence of an impudent man. _she_ blushed, and jane blushed; but the
 cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered variation of
 colour.
 
there was want of discourse. the bride and her mother could neither
 of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near
 elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
 with good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
 replies. they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
 world. nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led
 voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
 the world.
 
“only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since i went away:
 it seems but fortnight, i declare; and yet there have been things
 enough happened in the time. good gracious! when i went away, i am sure
 i had more idea of being married till i came back again! though i
 thought it would be very good fun if i was.”
 
her father lifted up his eyes, jane was distressed, elizabeth looked
 expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
 which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--
 
“oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know i am married to-day? i was
 afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle,
 so i was determined should know it, and so i let down the side glass
 next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the
 window frame, so that might see the ring, and then i bowed and
 smiled like anything.”
 
elizabeth could bear it longer. she got up and ran out of the room;
 and returned more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
 the dining-parlour. she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with
 anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to
 her eldest sister,--
 
“ah, jane, i take your place now, and you must go lower, because i am a
 married woman.”
 
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment
 from which she had been so wholly free at first. her ease and good
 spirits increased. she longed to see mrs. philips, the lucases, and all
 their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “mrs. wickham” by
 each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring
 and boast of being married to mrs. hill and the two housemaids.
 
“well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the
 breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? is not a
 charming man? i am sure my sisters must all envy me. i only hope they
 may have half my good luck. they must all go to brighton. that is the
 place to get husbands. what pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”
 
“very true; and if i had my will we should. but, my dear lydia, i don’t
 at all like your going such way off. must it be so?”
 
“oh, lord! yes; there is nothing in that. i shall like it of all things.
 you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. we shall be at
 newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some balls, and i
 will take care to get good partners for them all.”
 
“i should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.
 
“and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
 behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
 winter is over.”
 
“i thank you for my share of the favour,” said elizabeth; “but i do not
 particularly like your way of getting husbands.”
 
their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. mr. wickham
 had received his commission before left london, and was to join
 his regiment at the end of fortnight.
 
one but mrs. bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
 she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
 having very frequent parties at home. these parties were acceptable to
 all; to avoid family circle was even more desirable to such as did
 think than such as did not.
 
wickham’s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to
 find it; not equal to lydia’s for him. she had scarcely needed her
 present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
 their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
 than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
 for her, chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
 that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
 if that were the case, was not the young man to resist an opportunity
 of having companion.
 
lydia was exceedingly fond of him. was her dear wickham on every
 occasion; one was to be put in competition with him. did
 everything best in the world; and she was sure would kill more birds
 on the first of september than anybody else in the country.
 
one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
 elder sisters, she said to elizabeth,--
 
“lizzy, i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, i believe. you were
 not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it. are not you
 curious to hear how it was managed?”
 
“no, really,” replied elizabeth; “i think there cannot be too little
 said on the subject.”
 
“la! you are so strange! but i must tell you how it went off. we were
 married, you know, at st. clement’s, because wickham’s lodgings were in
 that parish. and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
 o’clock. my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others
 were to meet us at the church.
 
“well, monday morning came, and i was in such fuss! i was so afraid,
 you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then i should
 have gone quite distracted. and there was my aunt, all the time i was
 dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a
 sermon. however, i did not hear above one word in ten, for i was
 thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham. i longed to know whether
 would be married in his blue coat.
 
“well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: i thought it would never
 be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt
 were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them. if you’ll believe
 me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a
 fortnight. not one party, or scheme, or anything! to be sure, london was
 rather thin, but, however, the little theatre was open.
 
“well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was
 called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone. and then, you
 know, when once they get together, there is end of it. well, i was so
 frightened i did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give away;
 and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. but,
 luckily, came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set
 out. however, i recollected afterwards, that if _had_ been prevented
 going, the wedding need not be put off, for mr. darcy might have done as
 well.”
 
“mr. darcy!” repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.
 
“oh, yes! was to come there with wickham, you know. but, gracious me!
 i quite forgot! i ought not to have said word about it. i promised
 them so faithfully! what will wickham say? it was to be such secret!”
 
“if it was to be secret,” said jane, “say not another word on the
 subject. you may depend upon my seeking further.”
 
“oh, certainly,” said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will
 ask you questions.”
 
“thank you,” said lydia; “for if you did, i should certainly tell you
 all, and then wickham would be so angry.”
 
on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
 power, by running away.
 
but to live in ignorance on such point was impossible; or at least it
 was impossible not to try for information. mr. darcy had been at her
 sister’s wedding. it was exactly scene, and exactly among people,
 where had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
 conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
 brain; but she was satisfied with none. those that best pleased her, as
 placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. she
 could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing sheet of paper,
 wrote short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
 lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
 intended.
 
“you may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to
 know how person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively
 speaking, stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
 time. pray write instantly, and let understand it--unless it is,
 for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to
 think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
 ignorance.”
 
“not that i _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the
 letter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell in an honourable
 manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
 out.”
 
jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
 elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of
 it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
 satisfaction, she had rather be without confidante.

elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
 soon as she possibly could. she was sooner in possession of it, than
 hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
 interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
 happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
 contain denial.
 
/* right “gracechurch street, _sept. 6_. */
 
“my dear niece,
 
“i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
 morning to answering it, as i foresee that _little_ writing will
 not comprise what i have to tell you. i must confess myself
 surprised by your application; i did not expect it from _you_.
 don’t think angry, however, for i only mean to let you know,
 that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_
 side. if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
 impertinence. your uncle is as much surprised as i am; and nothing
 but the belief of your being party concerned would have allowed
 him to act as has done. but if you are really innocent and
 ignorant, i must be more explicit. on the very day of my coming
 home from longbourn, your uncle had most unexpected visitor. mr.
 darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. it was all
 over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
 as _yours_ seems to have been. came to tell mr. gardiner that he
 had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were, and that he
 had seen and talked with them both--wickham repeatedly, lydia once.
 from what i can collect, left derbyshire only one day after
 ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
 them. the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
 himself that wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as
 to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or
 confide in him. generously imputed the whole to his mistaken
 pride, and confessed that had before thought it beneath him to
 lay his private actions open to the world. his character was to
 speak for itself. called it, therefore, his duty to step
 forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on
 by himself. if _had another_ motive, i am sure it would never
 disgrace him. had been some days in town before was able to
 discover them; but had something to direct his search, which was
 more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another
 reason for his resolving to follow us. there is lady, it seems, a
 mrs. younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was
 dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
 did not say what. she then took large house in edward street,
 and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. this mrs.
 younge was, knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he
 went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as got to town. but
 it was two or three days before could get from her what he
 wanted. she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery
 and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
 found. wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in
 london; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
 would have taken up their abode with her. at length, however, our
 kind friend procured the wished-for direction. they were in ----
 street. saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.
 his first object with her, acknowledged, had been to persuade
 her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
 friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
 offering his assistance as far as it would go. but found lydia
 absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. she cared for none
 of her friends; she wanted help of his; she would not hear of
 leaving wickham. she was sure they should be married some time or
 other, and it did not much signify when. since such were her
 feelings, it only remained, thought, to secure and expedite a
 marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he
 easily learnt had never been _his_ design. confessed himself
 obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour
 which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill
 consequences of lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. meant to
 resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,
 could conjecture very little about it. must go somewhere, but
 did not know where, and knew should have nothing to live
 on. mr. darcy asked why did not marry your sister at once.
 though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich, would have
 been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been
 benefited by marriage. but found, in reply to this question,
 that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making
 his fortune by marriage, in some other country. under such
 circumstances, however, was not likely to be proof against the
 temptation of immediate relief. they met several times, for there
 was much to be discussed. wickham, of course, wanted more than he
 could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. everything
 being settled between _them_, mr. darcy’s next step was to make
 your uncle acquainted with it, and first called in gracechurch
 street the evening before i came home. but mr. gardiner could not
 be seen; and mr. darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father
 was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. did
 not judge your father to be person whom could so properly
 consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him
 till after the departure of the former. did not leave his name,
 and till the next day it was only known that gentleman had called
 on business. on saturday came again. your father was gone, your
 uncle at home, and, as i said before, they had great deal of talk
 together. they met again on sunday, and then _i_ saw him too. it
 was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express
 was sent off to longbourn. but our visitor was very obstinate. i
 fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,
 after all. has been accused of many faults at different times;
 but _this_ is the true one. nothing was to be done that did not
 do himself; though i am sure (and i do not speak it to be thanked,
 therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have
 settled the whole. they battled it together for long time, which
 was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it
 deserved. but at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead
 of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up
 with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely
 against the grain; and i really believe your letter this morning
 gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that
 would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
 it was due. but, lizzy, this must go further than yourself, or
 jane at most. you know pretty well, i suppose, what has been done
 for the young people. his debts are to be paid, amounting, i
 believe, to considerably more than thousand pounds, another
 thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
 commission purchased. the reason why all this was to be done by him
 alone, was such as i have given above. it was owing to him, to his
 reserve and want of proper consideration, that wickham’s character
 had been so misunderstood, and consequently that had been
 received and noticed as was. perhaps there was some truth in
 _this_; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_
 reserve can be answerable for the event. but in spite of all this
 fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that
 your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
 for _another interest_ in the affair. when all this was resolved
 on, returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
 pemberley; but it was agreed that should be in london once more
 when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
 receive the last finish. i believe i have now told you everything.
 it is relation which you tell is to give you great surprise; i
 hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. lydia came to
 us, and wickham had constant admission to the house. _he_ was
 exactly what had been when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i
 would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
 while she stayed with us, if i had not perceived, by jane’s letter
 last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
 piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you can give you no
 fresh pain. i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
 representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all
 the unhappiness she had brought on her family. if she heard me, it
 was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen. i was sometimes
 quite provoked; but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane,
 and for their sakes had patience with her. mr. darcy was punctual
 in his return, and, as lydia informed you, attended the wedding. he
 dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on
 wednesday or thursday. will you be very angry with me, my dear
 lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold
 enough to say before) how much i like him? his behaviour to us has,
 in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.
 his understanding and opinions all please me; wants nothing but
 little more liveliness, and _that_, if marry _prudently_, his
 wife may teach him. i thought him very sly; hardly ever
 mentioned your name. but slyness seems the fashion. pray forgive
 me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish so
 far as to exclude from p. i shall never be quite happy till i
 have been all round the park. low phaeton with nice little pair
 of ponies would be the very thing. but i must write more. the
 children have been wanting this half hour.
 
“yours, very sincerely,
 
“m. gardiner.”
 

the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into flutter of spirits,
 in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
 greatest share. the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
 produced, of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her
 sister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of
 goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be
 just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest
 extent to be true! had followed them purposely to town, had taken
 on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a
 research; in which supplication had been necessary to woman whom he
 must abominate and despise, and where was reduced to meet, frequently
 meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom always
 most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to
 pronounce. had done all this for girl whom could neither regard
 nor esteem. her heart did whisper that had done it for her. but it
 was hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt
 that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his
 affection for her, for woman who had already refused him, as able to
 overcome sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with
 wickham. brother-in-law of wickham! every kind of pride must revolt from
 the connection. had, to be sure, done much. she was ashamed to think
 how much. but had given reason for his interference, which asked no
 extraordinary stretch of belief. it was reasonable that should feel
 had been wrong; had liberality, and had the means of exercising
 it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
 she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might
 assist his endeavours in cause where her peace of mind must be
 materially concerned. it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
 they were under obligations to person who could never receive a
 return. they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, everything to
 him. oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she
 had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards
 him! for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that
 in cause of compassion and honour had been able to get the better
 of himself. she read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and
 again. it was hardly enough; but it pleased her. she was even sensible
 of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly
 both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence
 subsisted between mr. darcy and herself.
 
she was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;
 and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by
 wickham.
 
“i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,
 as joined her.
 
“you certainly do,” she replied with smile; “but it does not follow
 that the interruption must be unwelcome.”
 
“i should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _we_ were always good friends,
 and now we are better.”
 
“true. are the others coming out?”
 
“i do not know. mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
 meryton. and so, my dear sister, i find, from our uncle and aunt, that
 you have actually seen pemberley.”
 
she replied in the affirmative.
 
“i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much
 for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle. and you saw the
 old housekeeper, i suppose? poor reynolds, she was always very fond of
 me. but of course she did not mention my name to you.”
 
“yes, she did.”
 
“and what did she say?”
 
“that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
 out well. at such distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
 misrepresented.”
 
“certainly,” replied, biting his lips. elizabeth hoped she had
 silenced him; but soon afterwards said,--
 
“i was surprised to see darcy in town last month. we passed each other
 several times. i wonder what can be doing there.”
 
“perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss bourgh,” said
 elizabeth. “it must be something particular to take him there at this
 time of year.”
 
“undoubtedly. did you see him while you were at lambton? i thought i
 understood from the gardiners that you had.”
 
“yes; introduced us to his sister.”
 
“and do you like her?”
 
“very much.”
 
“i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
 or two. when i last saw her, she was not very promising. i am very glad
 you liked her. i hope she will turn out well.”
 
“i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”
 
“did you go by the village of kympton?”
 
“i do not recollect that we did.”
 
“i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had. most
 delightful place! excellent parsonage-house! it would have suited in
 every respect.”
 
“how should you have liked making sermons?”
 
“exceedingly well. i should have considered it as part of my duty, and
 the exertion would soon have been nothing. one ought not to repine; but,
 to be sure, it would have been such thing for me! the quiet, the
 retirement of such life, would have answered all my ideas of
 happiness! but it was not to be. did you ever hear darcy mention the
 circumstance when you were in kent?”
 
“i _have_ heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was
 left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”
 
“you have! yes, there was something in _that_; i told you so from the
 first, you may remember.”
 
“i _did_ hear, too, that there was time when sermon-making was not so
 palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
 declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
 had been compromised accordingly.”
 
“you did! and it was not wholly without foundation. you may remember
 what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”
 
they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
 to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,
 she only said in reply, with good-humoured smile,--
 
“come, mr. wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. do not let us
 quarrel about the past. in future, i hope we shall be always of one
 mind.”
 
she held out her hand: kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
 hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.

mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
 never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth,
 by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
 had said enough to keep him quiet.
 
the day of his and lydia’s departure soon came; and mrs. bennet was
 forced to submit to separation, which, as her husband by means
 entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to
 continue at least twelvemonth.
 
“oh, my dear lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”
 
“oh, lord! i don’t know. not these two or three years, perhaps.”
 
“write to very often, my dear.”
 
“as often as i can. but you know married women have never much time for
 writing. my sisters may write to _me_. they will have nothing else to
 do.”
 
mr. wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. he
 smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
 
“he is as fine fellow,” said mr. bennet, as soon as they were out of
 the house, “as ever i saw. simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
 all. i am prodigiously proud of him. i defy even sir william lucas
 himself to produce more valuable son-in-law.”
 
the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days.
 
“i often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with
 one’s friends. one seems so forlorn without them.”
 
“this is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying daughter,” said
 elizabeth. “it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
 single.”
 
“it is such thing. lydia does not leave because she is married;
 but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. if
 that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”
 
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
 relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
 article of news which then began to be in circulation. the housekeeper
 at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
 master, who was coming down in day or two, to shoot there for several
 weeks. mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets. she looked at jane, and
 smiled, and shook her head, by turns.
 
“well, well, and so mr. bingley is coming down, sister,” (for mrs.
 philips first brought her the news). “well, so much the better. not that
 i care about it, though. is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure i
 never want to see him again. but, however, is very welcome to come to
 netherfield, if likes it. and who knows what _may_ happen? but that
 is nothing to us. you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention
 word about it. and so, it is quite certain is coming?”
 
“you may depend on it,” replied the other, “for mrs. nichols was in
 meryton last night: i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
 to know the truth of it; and she told that it was certainly true. he
 comes down on thursday, at the latest, very likely on wednesday. she was
 going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
 wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”
 
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
 colour. it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
 elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--
 
“i saw you look at to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
 report; and i know i appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from
 any silly cause. i was only confused for the moment, because i felt that
 i _should_ be looked at. i do assure you that the news does not affect
 either with pleasure or pain. i am glad of one thing, that comes
 alone; because we shall see the less of him. not that i am afraid of
 _myself_, but i dread other people’s remarks.”
 
elizabeth did not know what to make of it. had she not seen him in
 derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
 other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
 to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
 there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come
 without it.
 
“yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come
 to house, which has legally hired, without raising all this
 speculation! i _will_ leave him to himself.”
 
in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
 feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily
 perceive that her spirits were affected by it. they were more disturbed,
 more unequal, than she had often seen them.
 
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
 about twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
 
“as soon as ever mr. bingley comes, my dear,” said mrs. bennet, “you
 will wait on him, of course.”
 
“no, no. you forced into visiting him last year, and promised, if i
 went to see him, should marry one of my daughters. but it ended in
 nothing, and i will not be sent on fool’s errand again.”
 
his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
 would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
 netherfield.
 
“’tis an _etiquette_ i despise,” said he. “if wants our society, let
 him seek it. knows where we live. i will not spend _my_ hours in
 running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
 again.”
 
“well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
 on him. but, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, i
 am determined. we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon. that will
 make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
 him.”
 
consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
 husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
 neighbours might all see mr. bingley, in consequence of it, before
 _they_ did. as the day of his arrival drew near,--
 
“i begin to be sorry that comes at all,” said jane to her sister. “it
 would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference; but i can
 hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. my mother means well;
 but she does not know, one can know, how much i suffer from what she
 says. happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over!”
 
“i wish i could say anything to comfort you,” replied elizabeth; “but it
 is wholly out of my power. you must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
 of preaching patience to sufferer is denied me, because you have
 always so much.”
 
mr. bingley arrived. mrs. bennet, through the assistance of servants,
 contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
 and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. she counted the days
 that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of
 seeing him before. but on the third morning after his arrival in
 hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the
 paddock, and ride towards the house.
 
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. jane resolutely
 kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
 to the window--she looked--she saw mr. darcy with him, and sat down
 again by her sister.
 
“there is gentleman with him, mamma,” said kitty; “who can it be?”
 
“some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not
 know.”
 
“la!” replied kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with
 him before. mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”
 
“good gracious! mr. darcy!--and so it does, i vow. well, any friend of
 mr. bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else i must
 say that i hate the very sight of him.”
 
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern. she knew but little
 of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
 which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
 after receiving his explanatory letter. both sisters were uncomfortable
 enough. each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
 mother talked on of her dislike of mr. darcy, and her resolution to be
 civil to him only as mr. bingley’s friend, without being heard by either
 of them. but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be
 suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs.
 gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards
 him. to jane, could be only man whose proposals she had refused,
 and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
 information, was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
 for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
 interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
 what jane felt for bingley. her astonishment at his coming--at his
 coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
 was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
 behaviour in derbyshire.
 
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
 minute with an additional glow, and smile of delight added lustre to
 her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
 wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.
 
“let first see how behaves,” said she; “it will then be early
 enough for expectation.”
 
she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
 lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
 sister as the servant was approaching the door. jane looked little
 paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected. on the
 gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
 tolerable ease, and with propriety of behaviour equally free from any
 symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.
 
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
 again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. she
 had ventured only one glance at darcy. looked serious as usual; and,
 she thought, more as had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as
 she had seen him at pemberley. but, perhaps, could not in her
 mother’s presence be what was before her uncle and aunt. it was a
 painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.
 
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
 saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. was received by mrs.
 bennet with degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
 especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
 her courtesy and address of his friend.
 
elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
 preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
 hurt and distressed to most painful degree by distinction so ill
 applied.
 
darcy, after inquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did--a question
 which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. he
 was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
 it had not been so in derbyshire. there had talked to her friends
 when could not to herself. but now several minutes elapsed, without
 bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
 the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
 found him looking at jane as at herself, and frequently on object but
 the ground. more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
 they last met, were plainly expressed. she was disappointed, and angry
 with herself for being so.
 
“could i expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “yet why did come?”
 
she was in humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
 him she had hardly courage to speak.
 
she inquired after his sister, but could do more.
 
“it is long time, mr. bingley, since you went away,” said mrs. bennet.
 
readily agreed to it.
 
“i began to be afraid you would never come back again. people _did_ say,
 you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope
 it is not true. great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
 since you went away. miss lucas is married and settled: and one of my
 own daughters. i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
 seen it in the papers. it was in the ‘times’ and the ‘courier,’ i know;
 though it was not put in as it ought to be. it was only said, ‘lately,
 george wickham, esq., to miss lydia bennet,’ without there being a
 syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
 it was my brother gardiner’s drawing up, too, and i wonder how came
 to make such an awkward business of it. did you see it?”
 
bingley replied that did, and made his congratulations. elizabeth
 dared not lift up her eyes. how mr. darcy looked, therefore, she could
 not tell.
 
“it is delightful thing, to be sure, to have daughter well married,”
 continued her mother; “but at the same time, mr. bingley, it is very
 hard to have her taken away from me. they are gone down to newcastle, a
 place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, i do not
 know how long. his regiment is there; for i suppose you have heard of
 his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.
 thank heaven! has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he
 deserves.”
 
elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy, was in such misery
 of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. it drew from her, however,
 the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done
 before; and she asked bingley whether meant to make any stay in the
 country at present. few weeks, believed.
 
“when you have killed all your own birds, mr. bingley,” said her mother,
 “i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr.
 bennet’s manor. i am sure will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
 will save all the best of the coveys for you.”
 
elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious
 attention! were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
 flattered them year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be
 hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. at that instant she felt,
 that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for
 moments of such painful confusion.
 
“the first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be
 in company with either of them. their society can afford pleasure
 that will atone for such wretchedness as this! let never see either
 one or the other again!”
 
yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
 compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
 how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former
 lover. when first came in, had spoken to her but little, but every
 five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. found her
 as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as
 unaffected, though not quite so chatty. jane was anxious that no
 difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
 that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,
 that she did not always know when she was silent.
 
when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs. bennet was mindful of her
 intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
 longbourn in few days’ time.
 
“you are quite visit in my debt, mr. bingley,” she added; “for when
 you went to town last winter, you promised to take family dinner with
 us as soon as you returned. i have not forgot, you see; and i assure you
 i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your
 engagement.”
 
bingley looked little silly at this reflection, and said something of
 his concern at having been prevented by business. they then went away.
 
mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
 there that day; but, though she always kept very good table, she did
 not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for man
 on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
 of one who had ten thousand year.

as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
 or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects
 which must deaden them more. mr. darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed
 her.
 
“why, if came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,
 “did come at all?”
 
she could settle it in way that gave her pleasure.
 
“he could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he
 was in town; and why not to me? if fears me, why come hither? if he
 longer cares for me, why silent? teasing, teasing man! i will think
 more about him.”
 
her resolution was for short time involuntarily kept by the approach
 of her sister, who joined her with cheerful look which showed her
 better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth.
 
“now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly
 easy. i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by
 his coming. i am glad dines here on tuesday. it will then be publicly
 seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent
 acquaintance.”
 
“yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said elizabeth, laughingly. “oh, jane!
 take care.”
 
“my dear lizzy, you cannot think so weak as to be in danger now.”
 
“i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
 you as ever.”
 
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs. bennet, in
 the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the
 good-humour and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour’s visit,
 had revived.
 
on tuesday there was large party assembled at longbourn; and the two
 who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
 sportsmen, were in very good time. when they repaired to the
 dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
 the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
 her sister. her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
 invite him to sit by herself. on entering the room, seemed to
 hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
 decided. placed himself by her.
 
elizabeth, with triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. he
 bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that
 bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
 likewise turned towards mr. darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
 alarm.
 
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an
 admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
 elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, jane’s happiness, and his
 own, would be speedily secured. though she dared not depend upon the
 consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. it
 gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
 cheerful humour. mr. darcy was almost as far from her as the table
 could divide them. was on one side of her mother. she knew how little
 such situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
 advantage. she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but
 she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
 cold was their manner whenever they did. her mother’s ungraciousness
 made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth’s mind;
 and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
 him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
 the family.
 
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
 bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
 without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,
 than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. anxious and
 uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen
 came, was wearisome and dull to degree that almost made her uncivil.
 she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her
 chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
 
“if does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “i shall give him up for
 ever.”
 
the gentlemen came; and she thought looked as if would have
 answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
 where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
 in so close confederacy, that there was not single vacancy near her
 which would admit of chair. and on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of
 the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in whisper,--
 
“the men shan’t come and part us, i am determined. we want none of them;
 do we?”
 
darcy had walked away to another part of the room. she followed him with
 her eyes, envied everyone to whom spoke, had scarcely patience enough
 to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for
 being so silly!
 
“a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to
 expect renewal of his love? is there one among the sex who would not
 protest against such weakness as second proposal to the same woman?
 there is indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”
 
she was little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup
 himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--
 
“is your sister at pemberley still?”
 
“yes; she will remain there till christmas.”
 
“and quite alone? have all her friends left her?”
 
“mrs. annesley is with her. the others have been gone on to scarborough
 these three weeks.”
 
she could think of nothing more to say; but if wished to converse
 with her, might have better success. stood by her, however, for
 some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering
 to elizabeth again, walked away.
 
when the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
 all rose; and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
 all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall victim to her
 mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in few moments after seated
 with the rest of the party. she now lost every expectation of pleasure.
 they were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had
 nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
 of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
 
mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
 supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the
 others, and she had opportunity of detaining them.
 
“well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what
 say you to the day? i think everything has passed off uncommonly well, i
 assure you. the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw. the
 venison was roasted to turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
 haunch. the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
 lucases’ last week; and even mr. darcy acknowledged that the partridges
 were remarkably well done; and i suppose has two or three french
 cooks at least. and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater
 beauty. mrs. long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not. and
 what do you think she said besides? ‘ah! mrs. bennet, we shall have her
 at netherfield at last!’ she did, indeed. i do think mrs. long is as
 good creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved
 girls, and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously.”
 
[illustration:
 
“m^{rs}. long and her nieces.”

mrs. bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of
 bingley’s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at
 last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in happy
 humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
 not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
 
“it has been very agreeable day,” said miss bennet to elizabeth. “the
 party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. i hope we
 may often meet again.”
 
elizabeth smiled.
 
“lizzy, you must not do so. you must not suspect me. it mortifies me. i
 assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
 agreeable and sensible young man without having wish beyond it. i am
 perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that never had
 any design of engaging my affection. it is only that is blessed with
 greater sweetness of address, and stronger desire of generally
 pleasing, than any other man.”
 
“you are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let smile, and
 are provoking to it every moment.”
 
“how hard it is in some cases to be believed! and how impossible in
 others! but why should you wish to persuade that i feel more than i
 acknowledge?”
 
“that is question which i hardly know how to answer. we all love to
 instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. forgive
 me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
 confidante.”

chapter lv.
 

[illustration]
 
few days after this visit, mr. bingley called again, and alone. his
 friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in
 ten days’ time. sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
 good spirits. mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
 expressions of concern, confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
 
“next time you call,” said she, “i hope we shall be more lucky.”
 
should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she
 would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on
 them.
 
“can you come to-morrow?”
 
yes, had engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
 accepted with alacrity.
 
came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
 dressed. in ran mrs. bennet to her daughters’ room, in her
 dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--
 
“my dear jane, make haste and hurry down. is come--mr. bingley is
 come. is, indeed. make haste, make haste. here, sarah, come to miss
 bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. never mind miss
 lizzy’s hair.”
 
“we will be down as soon as we can,” said jane; “but i dare say kitty is
 forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”
 
“oh! hang kitty! what has she to do with it? come, be quick, be quick!
 where is your sash, my dear?”
 
but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down
 without one of her sisters.
 
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
 evening. after tea, mr. bennet retired to the library, as was his
 custom, and mary went upstairs to her instrument. two obstacles of the
 five being thus removed, mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at
 elizabeth and catherine for considerable time, without making any
 impression on them. elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
 kitty did, she very innocently said, “what is the matter, mamma? what do
 you keep winking at for? what am i to do?”
 
“nothing, child, nothing. i did not wink at you.” she then sat still
 five minutes longer; but unable to waste such precious occasion, she
 suddenly got up, and saying to kitty,--
 
“come here, my love, i want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.
 jane instantly gave look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such
 premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. in a
 few minutes, mrs. bennet half opened the door and called out,--
 
“lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you.”
 
elizabeth was forced to go.
 
“we may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as
 soon as she was in the hall. “kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in
 my dressing-room.”
 
elizabeth made attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
 quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned
 into the drawing-room.
 
mrs. bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. bingley was
 everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her
 daughter. his ease and cheerfulness rendered him most agreeable
 addition to their evening party; and bore with the ill-judged
 officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a
 forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the
 daughter.
 
scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before went away
 an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs. bennet’s
 means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
 
after this day, jane said more of her indifference. not word passed
 between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in the
 happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr. darcy
 returned within the stated time. seriously, however, she felt tolerably
 persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s
 concurrence.
 
bingley was punctual to his appointment; and and mr. bennet spent the
 morning together, as had been agreed on. the latter was much more
 agreeable than his companion expected. there was nothing of presumption
 or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
 silence; and was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
 other had ever seen him. bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
 and in the evening mrs. bennet’s invention was again at work to get
 everybody away from him and her daughter. elizabeth, who had letter to
 write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for
 as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
 wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.
 
but on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,
 she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her
 mother had been too ingenious for her. on opening the door, she
 perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as
 if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to suspicion,
 the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each
 other, would have told it all. _their_ situation was awkward enough; but
 _hers_ she thought was still worse. not syllable was uttered by
 either; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when
 bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,
 whispering few words to her sister, ran out of the room.
 
jane could have reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give
 pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
 emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
 
“’tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. i do not deserve it. oh,
 why is not everybody as happy?”
 
elizabeth’s congratulations were given with sincerity, warmth, a
 delight, which words could but poorly express. every sentence of
 kindness was fresh source of happiness to jane. but she would not
 allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
 said, for the present.
 
“i must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “i would not on any
 account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it
 from anyone but myself. is gone to my father already. oh, lizzy, to
 know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
 family! how shall i bear so much happiness?”
 
she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
 card-party, and was sitting upstairs with kitty.
 
elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
 with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
 previous months of suspense and vexation.
 
“and this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious
 circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the
 happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”
 
in few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her
 father had been short and to the purpose.
 
“where is your sister?” said hastily, as opened the door.
 
“with my mother upstairs. she will be down in moment, i dare say.”
 
then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
 and affection of sister. elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
 delight in the prospect of their relationship. they shook hands with
 great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
 to all had to say of his own happiness, and of jane’s perfections;
 and in spite of his being lover, elizabeth really believed all his
 expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
 basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of
 jane, and general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
 himself.
 
it was an evening of common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
 miss bennet’s mind gave such glow of sweet animation to her face, as
 made her look handsomer than ever. kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
 her turn was coming soon. mrs. bennet could not give her consent, or
 speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
 though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
 mr. bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
 how really happy was.
 
not word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
 visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as was gone, he
 turned to his daughter and said,--
 
“jane, i congratulate you. you will be very happy woman.”
 
jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
 goodness.
 
“you are good girl,” replied, “and i have great pleasure in
 thinking you will be so happily settled. i have not doubt of your
 doing very well together. your tempers are by means unlike. you are
 each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
 easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
 always exceed your income.”
 
“i hope not so. imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
 unpardonable in _me_.”
 
“exceed their income! my dear mr. bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you
 talking of? why, has four or five thousand year, and very likely
 more.” then addressing her daughter, “oh, my dear, dear jane, i am so
 happy! i am sure i shan’t get wink of sleep all night. i knew how it
 would be. i always said it must be so, at last. i was sure you could not
 be so beautiful for nothing! i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when
 first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was
 that you should come together. oh, is the handsomest young man that
 ever was seen!”
 
wickham, lydia, were all forgotten. jane was beyond competition her
 favourite child. at that moment she cared for other. her younger
 sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
 which she might in future be able to dispense.
 
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty
 begged very hard for few balls there every winter.
 
bingley, from this time, was of course daily visitor at longbourn;
 coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
 supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
 detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which thought
 himself obliged to accept.
 
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
 while was present jane had attention to bestow on anyone else: but
 she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of
 separation that must sometimes occur. in the absence of jane, always
 attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and
 when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief.
 
“he has made so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling that he
 was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! i had not believed
 it possible.”
 
“i suspected as much,” replied elizabeth. “but how did account for
 it?”
 
“it must have been his sisters’ doing. they were certainly friends to
 his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since might have
 chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. but when they see,
 as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
 learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we
 can never be what we once were to each other.”
 
“that is the most unforgiving speech,” said elizabeth, “that i ever
 heard you utter. good girl! it would vex me, indeed, to see you again
 the dupe of miss bingley’s pretended regard.”
 
“would you believe it, lizzy, that when went to town last november he
 really loved me, and nothing but persuasion of _my_ being indifferent
 would have prevented his coming down again?”
 
“he made little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
 modesty.”
 
this naturally introduced panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and
 the little value put on his own good qualities.
 
elizabeth was pleased to find that had not betrayed the interference
 of his friend; for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving
 heart in the world, she knew it was circumstance which must prejudice
 her against him.
 
“i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried
 jane. “oh, lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed
 above them all? if i could but see you as happy! if there were but such
 another man for you!”
 
“if you were to give forty such men i never could be so happy as you.
 till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your
 happiness. no, no, let shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very
 good luck, i may meet with another mr. collins in time.”
 
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
 secret. mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. philips, and
 she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
 neighbours in meryton.
 
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
 world; though only few weeks before, when lydia had first run away,
 they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.

one morning, about week after bingley’s engagement with jane had been
 formed, as and the females of the family were sitting together in the
 dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the
 sound of carriage; and they perceived chaise and four driving up the
 lawn. it was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the
 equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. the horses
 were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
 preceded it, were familiar to them. as it was certain, however, that
 somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
 the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
 shrubbery. they both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three
 continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
 open, and their visitor entered. it was lady catherine bourgh.
 
they were of course all intending to be surprised: but their
 astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs.
 bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
 inferior to what elizabeth felt.
 
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
 other reply to elizabeth’s salutation than slight inclination of the
 head, and sat down without saying word. elizabeth had mentioned her
 name to her mother on her ladyship’s entrance, though request of
 introduction had been made.
 
mrs. bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having guest of such
 high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. after sitting
 for moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to elizabeth,--
 
“i hope you are well, miss bennet. that lady, i suppose, is your
 mother?”
 
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
 
“and _that_, i suppose, is one of your sisters?”
 
“yes, madam,” said mrs. bennet, delighted to speak to lady catherine.
 “she is my youngest girl but one. my youngest of all is lately married,
 and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with young man,
 who, i believe, will soon become part of the family.”
 
“you have very small park here,” returned lady catherine, after a
 short silence.
 
“it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but, i
 assure you, it is much larger than sir william lucas’s.”
 
“this must be most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in
 summer: the windows are full west.”
 
mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
 added,--
 
“may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and
 mrs. collins well?”
 
“yes, very well. i saw them the night before last.”
 
elizabeth now expected that she would produce letter for her from
 charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. but no
 letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
 
mrs. bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
 refreshment: but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
 declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to elizabeth,--
 
“miss bennet, there seemed to be prettyish kind of little wilderness
 on one side of your lawn. i should be glad to take turn in it, if you
 will favour with your company.”
 
“go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the
 different walks. i think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”
 
elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,
 attended her noble guest downstairs. as they passed through the hall,
 lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
 drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after short survey, to be
 decent-looking rooms, walked on.
 
her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her
 waiting-woman was in it. they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
 that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make effort for
 conversation with woman who was now more than usually insolent and
 disagreeable.

“how could i ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in
 her face.
 
as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following
 manner:--
 
“you can be at loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my
 journey hither. your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
 come.”
 
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
 
“indeed, you are mistaken, madam; i have not been at all able to account
 for the honour of seeing you here.”
 
“miss bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to
 know that i am not to be trifled with. but however insincere _you_ may
 choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. my character has ever been
 celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in cause of such
 moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it. report of most
 alarming nature reached two days ago. i was told, that not only your
 sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
 _you_--that miss elizabeth bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon
 afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, mr. darcy. though i
 _know_ it must be scandalous falsehood, though i would not injure him
 so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on
 setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to
 you.”
 
“if you believed it impossible to be true,” said elizabeth, colouring
 with astonishment and disdain, “i wonder you took the trouble of coming
 so far. what could your ladyship propose by it?”
 
“at once to insist upon having such report universally contradicted.”
 
“your coming to longbourn, to see and my family,” said elizabeth
 coolly, “will be rather confirmation of it--if, indeed, such report
 is in existence.”
 
“if! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? has it not been
 industriously circulated by yourselves? do you not know that such a
 report is spread abroad?”
 
“i never heard that it was.”
 
“and can you likewise declare, that there is _foundation_ for it?”
 
“i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. _you_
 may ask questions which _i_ shall not choose to answer.”
 
“this is not to be borne. miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied. has
 he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”
 
“your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”
 
“it ought to be so; it must be so, while retains the use of his
 reason. but _your_ arts and allurements may, in moment of infatuation,
 have made him forget what owes to himself and to all his family. you
 may have drawn him in.”
 
“if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it.”
 
“miss bennet, do you know who i am? i have not been accustomed to such
 language as this. i am almost the nearest relation has in the world,
 and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”
 
“but you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
 this ever induce to be explicit.”
 
“let be rightly understood. this match, to which you have the
 presumption to aspire, can never take place. no, never. mr. darcy is
 engaged to _my daughter_. now, what have you to say?”
 
“only this,--that if is so, you can have reason to suppose will
 make an offer to me.”
 
lady catherine hesitated for moment, and then replied,--
 
“the engagement between them is of peculiar kind. from their infancy,
 they have been intended for each other. it was the favourite wish of
 _his_ mother, as well as of hers. while in their cradles we planned the
 union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be
 accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by young woman of
 inferior birth, of importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
 the family? do you pay regard to the wishes of his friends--to his
 tacit engagement with miss bourgh? are you lost to every feeling of
 propriety and delicacy? have you not heard say, that from his
 earliest hours was destined for his cousin?”
 
“yes; and i had heard it before. but what is that to me? if there is no
 other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be
 kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
 miss bourgh. you both did as much as you could in planning the
 marriage. its completion depended on others. if mr. darcy is neither by
 honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not to make
 another choice? and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?”
 
“because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. yes, miss
 bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
 friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. you will
 be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
 your alliance will be disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
 by any of us.”
 
“these are heavy misfortunes,” replied elizabeth. “but the wife of mr.
 darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
 attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have cause
 to repine.”
 
“obstinate, headstrong girl! i am ashamed of you! is this your gratitude
 for my attentions to you last spring? is nothing due to on that
 score? let us sit down. you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came
 here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i
 be dissuaded from it. i have not been used to submit to any person’s
 whims. i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”
 
“_that_ will make your ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;
 but it will have effect on _me_.”
 
“i will not be interrupted! hear in silence. my daughter and my
 nephew are formed for each other. they are descended, on the maternal
 side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,
 honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. their fortune on
 both sides is splendid. they are destined for each other by the voice of
 every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide
 them?--the upstart pretensions of young woman without family,
 connections, or fortune! is this to be endured? but it must not, shall
 not be! if you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to
 quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”
 
“in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that
 sphere. is gentleman; i am gentleman’s daughter; so far we are
 equal.”
 
“true. you _are_ gentleman’s daughter. but what was your mother? who
 are your uncles and aunts? do not imagine ignorant of their
 condition.”
 
“whatever my connections may be,” said elizabeth, “if your nephew does
 not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”
 
“tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”
 
though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady
 catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
 moment’s deliberation,--
 
“i am not.”
 
lady catherine seemed pleased.
 
“and will you promise never to enter into such an engagement?”
 
“i will make promise of the kind.”
 
“miss bennet, i am shocked and astonished. i expected to find more
 reasonable young woman. but do not deceive yourself into belief that i
 will ever recede. i shall not go away till you have given the
 assurance i require.”
 
“and i certainly _never_ shall give it. i am not to be intimidated into
 anything so wholly unreasonable. your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry
 your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make
 _their_ marriage at all more probable? supposing him to be attached to
 me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on
 his cousin? allow to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with
 which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
 frivolous as the application was ill-judged. you have widely mistaken my
 character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
 how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
 i cannot tell; but you have certainly right to concern yourself in
 mine. i must beg, therefore, to be importuned further on the
 subject.”
 
“not so hasty, if you please. i have by means done. to all the
 objections i have already urged i have still another to add. i am no
 stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous
 elopement. i know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a
 patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. and is
 _such_ girl to be my nephew’s sister? is _her_ husband, who is the son
 of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? heaven and earth!--of
 what are you thinking? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?”
 
“you can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.
 “you have insulted me, in every possible method. i must beg to return to
 the house.”
 
and she rose as she spoke. lady catherine rose also, and they turned
 back. her ladyship was highly incensed.
 
“you have regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
 unfeeling, selfish girl! do you not consider that connection with you
 must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”
 
“lady catherine, i have nothing further to say. you know my sentiments.”
 
“you are then resolved to have him?”
 
“i have said such thing. i am only resolved to act in that manner,
 which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
 reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”
 
“it is well. you refuse, then, to oblige me. you refuse to obey the
 claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. you are determined to ruin him in
 the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”
 
“neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied elizabeth, “has any
 possible claim on me, in the present instance. principle of either
 would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy. and with regard to the
 resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
 _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give one moment’s
 concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
 the scorn.”
 
“and this is your real opinion! this is your final resolve! very well. i
 shall now know how to act. do not imagine, miss bennet, that your
 ambition will ever be gratified. i came to try you. i hoped to find you
 reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point.”
 
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of
 the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--
 
“i take leave of you, miss bennet. i send compliments to your
 mother. you deserve such attention. i am most seriously displeased.”
 
elizabeth made answer; and without attempting to persuade her
 ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. she
 heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. her mother
 impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why lady
 catherine would not come in again and rest herself.
 
“she did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”
 
“she is very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
 civil! for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.
 she is on her road somewhere, i dare say; and so, passing through
 meryton, thought she might as well call on you. i suppose she had
 nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?”
 
elizabeth was forced to give in to little falsehood here; for to
 acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.

chapter lvii.
 

[illustration]
 
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
 elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
 hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. lady catherine, it
 appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings
 for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr.
 darcy. it was rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of
 their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at loss to imagine;
 till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley,
 and _her_ being the sister of jane, was enough, at time when the
 expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
 the idea. she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
 sister must bring them more frequently together. and her neighbours at
 lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
 collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady catherine,) had
 only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had
 looked forward to as possible at some future time.
 
in revolving lady catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help
 feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
 in this interference. from what she had said of her resolution to
 prevent the marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an
 application to her nephew; and how might take similar
 representation of the evils attached to connection with her she dared
 not pronounce. she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
 aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
 that thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
 was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of marriage with _one_
 whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
 address him on his weakest side. with his notions of dignity, would
 probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak
 and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
 
if had been wavering before, as to what should do, which had often
 seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near relation might
 settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
 unblemished could make him. in that case would return more. lady
 catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
 bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.
 
“if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
 friend within few days,” she added, “i shall know how to understand
 it. i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
 constancy. if is satisfied with only regretting me, when might
 have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him
 at all.”
 
the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
 been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same
 kind of supposition which had appeased mrs. bennet’s curiosity; and
 elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.
 
the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
 father, who came out of his library with letter in his hand.
 
“lizzy,” said he, “i was going to look for you: come into my room.”
 
she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what had to tell
 her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
 connected with the letter held. it suddenly struck her that it might
 be from lady catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the
 consequent explanations.
 
she followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. he
 then said,--
 
“i have received letter this morning that has astonished me
 exceedingly. as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
 contents. i did not know before that i had _two_ daughters on the brink
 of matrimony. let congratulate you on very important conquest.”
 
the colour now rushed into elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous
 conviction of its being letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
 and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that explained
 himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
 herself, when her father continued,--
 
“you look conscious. young ladies have great penetration in such matters
 as these; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the
 name of your admirer. this letter is from mr. collins.”
 
“from mr. collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”
 
“something very much to the purpose, of course. begins with
 congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
 which, it seems, has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
 lucases. i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what says
 on that point. what relates to yourself is as follows:--‘having thus
 offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on
 this happy event, let now add short hint on the subject of another,
 of which we have been advertised by the same authority. your daughter
 elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after
 her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate
 may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages
 in this land.’ can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?
 ‘this young gentleman is blessed, in peculiar way, with everything the
 heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and
 extensive patronage. yet, in spite of all these temptations, let warn
 my cousin elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a
 precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,
 you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ have you any idea,
 lizzy, who this gentleman is? but now it comes out. ‘my motive for
 cautioning you is as follows:--we have reason to imagine that his aunt,
 lady catherine bourgh, does not look on the match with friendly
 eye.’ _mr. darcy_, you see, is the man! now, lizzy, i think i _have_
 surprised you. could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within
 the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
 effectually to what they related? mr. darcy, who never looks at any
 woman but to see blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
 his life! it is admirable!”
 
elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force
 one most reluctant smile. never had his wit been directed in manner so
 little agreeable to her.
 
“are you not diverted?”
 
“oh, yes. pray read on.”
 
“‘after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
 night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
 felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of
 some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give
 her consent to what she termed so disgraceful match. i thought it my
 duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she
 and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
 hastily into marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ mr.
 collins, moreover, adds, ‘i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia’s sad
 business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
 living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
 known. i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
 from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
 couple into your house as soon as they were married. it was an
 encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should
 very strenuously have opposed it. you ought certainly to forgive them as
 christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
 names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _that_ is his notion of
 christian forgiveness! the rest of his letter is only about his dear
 charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of young olive-branch. but,
 lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. you are not going to be
 _missish_, i hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. for
 what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them
 in our turn?”
 
“oh,” cried elizabeth, “i am exceedingly diverted. but it is so
 strange!”
 
“yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. had they fixed on any other man
 it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_
 pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! much as i abominate
 writing, i would not give up mr. collins’s correspondence for any
 consideration. nay, when i read letter of his, i cannot help giving
 him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and
 hypocrisy of my son-in-law. and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine
 about this report? did she call to refuse her consent?”
 
to this question his daughter replied only with laugh; and as it had
 been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
 repeating it. elizabeth had never been more at loss to make her
 feelings appear what they were not. it was necessary to laugh when she
 would rather have cried. her father had most cruelly mortified her by
 what said of mr. darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but
 wonder at such want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of
 his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.

chapter lviii.
 

[illustration]
 
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
 elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do, was able to bring darcy
 with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine’s
 visit. the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs. bennet had time to
 tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
 momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed
 their all walking out. it was agreed to. mrs. bennet was not in the
 habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
 set off together. bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to
 outstrip them. they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy
 were to entertain each other. very little was said by either; kitty was
 too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a
 desperate resolution; and, perhaps, might be doing the same.
 
they walked towards the lucases’, because kitty wished to call upon
 maria; and as elizabeth saw occasion for making it general concern,
 when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. now was the
 moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was
 high, she immediately said,--
 
“mr. darcy, i am very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving
 relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours. i
 can longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
 sister. ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to
 acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it. were it known to the rest
 of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”
 
“i am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied darcy, in tone of surprise
 and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
 mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. i did not think mrs. gardiner
 was so little to be trusted.”
 
“you must not blame my aunt. lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
 that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could
 not rest till i knew the particulars. let thank you again and again,
 in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
 you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
 sake of discovering them.”
 
“if you _will_ thank me,” replied, “let it be for yourself alone.
 that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
 inducements which led on, i shall not attempt to deny. but your
 _family_ owe nothing. much as i respect them, i believe i thought
 only of _you_.”
 
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say word. after short pause,
 her companion added, “you are too generous to trifle with me. if your
 feelings are still what they were last april, tell so at once. _my_
 affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence
 on this subject for ever.”
 
elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
 his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
 very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
 so material change since the period to which alluded, as to make
 her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. the
 happiness which this reply produced was such as had probably never
 felt before; and expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
 warmly as man violently in love can be supposed to do. had elizabeth
 been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the
 expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but
 though she could not look she could listen; and told her of feelings
 which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection
 every moment more valuable.
 
they walked on without knowing in what direction. there was too much to
 be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. she
 soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
 to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
 london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the
 substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
 every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship’s apprehension,
 peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
 such relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
 her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. but, unluckily for her
 ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
 
“it taught to hope,” said he, “as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
 to hope before. i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that
 had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
 acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly.”
 
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “yes, you know enough of
 my _frankness_ to believe capable of _that_. after abusing you so
 abominably to your face, i could have scruple in abusing you to all
 your relations.”
 
“what did you say of that i did not deserve? for though your
 accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
 to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. it was
 unpardonable. i cannot think of it without abhorrence.”
 
“we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
 evening,” said elizabeth. “the conduct of neither, if strictly
 examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, i hope,
 improved in civility.”
 
“i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. the recollection of what i
 then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
 it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. your
 reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a
 more gentlemanlike manner.’ those were your words. you know not, you can
 scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, i
 confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”
 
“i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
 impression. i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
 way.”
 
“i can easily believe it. you thought then devoid of every proper
 feeling, i am sure you did. the turn of your countenance i shall never
 forget, as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
 way that would induce you to accept me.”
 
“oh, do not repeat what i then said. these recollections will not do at
 all. i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”
 
darcy mentioned his letter. “did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you
 think better of me? did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
 contents?”
 
she explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all
 her former prejudices had been removed.
 
“i knew,” said he, “that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was
 necessary. i hope you have destroyed the letter. there was one part,
 especially the opening of it, which i should dread your having the power
 of reading again. i can remember some expressions which might justly
 make you hate me.”
 
“the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
 preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
 opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily
 changed as that implies.”
 
“when i wrote that letter,” replied darcy, “i believed myself perfectly
 calm and cool; but i am since convinced that it was written in a
 dreadful bitterness of spirit.”
 
“the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. the
 adieu is charity itself. but think more of the letter. the feelings
 of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely
 different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance
 attending it ought to be forgotten. you must learn some of my
 philosophy. think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
 pleasure.”
 
“i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _your_
 retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
 arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
 ignorance. but with _me_, it is not so. painful recollections will
 intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. i have been a
 selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. as a
 child i was taught what was _right_, but i was not taught to correct my
 temper. i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
 and conceit. unfortunately an only (for many years an only _child_),
 i was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father
 particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
 almost taught to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
 my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
 _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
 my own. such i was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such i might
 still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth! what do i not
 owe you! you taught lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
 advantageous. by you, i was properly humbled. i came to you without a
 doubt of my reception. you showed how insufficient were all my
 pretensions to please woman worthy of being pleased.”
 
“had you then persuaded yourself that i should?”
 
“indeed i had. what will you think of my vanity? i believed you to be
 wishing, expecting my addresses.”
 
“my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, i assure
 you. i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
 wrong. how you must have hated after _that_ evening!”
 
“hate you! i was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to
 take proper direction.”
 
“i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of when we met at
 pemberley. you blamed for coming?”
 
“no, indeed, i felt nothing but surprise.”
 
“your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
 my conscience told that i deserved extraordinary politeness, and i
 confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”
 
“my object _then_,” replied darcy, “was to show you, by every civility
 in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped
 to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
 see that your reproofs had been attended to. how soon any other wishes
 introduced themselves, i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half
 an hour after i had seen you.”
 
then told her of georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
 disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
 the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
 following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
 before quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there
 had arisen from other struggles than what such purpose must
 comprehend.
 
she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful subject to
 each to be dwelt on farther.
 
after walking several miles in leisurely manner, and too busy to know
 anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
 it was time to be at home.
 
“what could have become of mr. bingley and jane?” was wonder which
 introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. darcy was delighted with
 their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
 it.
 
“i must ask whether you were surprised?” said elizabeth.
 
“not at all. when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen.”
 
“that is to say, you had given your permission. i guessed as much.” and
 though exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
 the case.
 
“on the evening before my going to london,” said he, “i made a
 confession to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago. i told
 him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
 affairs absurd and impertinent. his surprise was great. had never had
 the slightest suspicion. i told him, moreover, that i believed myself
 mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent
 to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
 unabated, i felt doubt of their happiness together.”
 
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
 friend.
 
“did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him
 that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”
 
“from the former. i had narrowly observed her, during the two visits
 which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection.”
 
“and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to
 him.”
 
“it did. bingley is most unaffectedly modest. his diffidence had
 prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious case, but
 his reliance on mine made everything easy. i was obliged to confess one
 thing, which for time, and not unjustly, offended him. i could not
 allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
 last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him. was
 angry. but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted longer than remained
 in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. has heartily forgiven me
 now.”
 
elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been most delightful
 friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
 herself. she remembered that had yet to learn to be laughed at, and
 it was rather too early to begin. in anticipating the happiness of
 bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
 continued the conversation till they reached the house. in the hall they
 parted.

chapter lix.
 

[illustration]
 
“my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was question
 which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and
 from all the others when they sat down to table. she had only to say in
 reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
 knowledge. she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
 else, awakened suspicion of the truth.
 
the evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. the
 acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.
 darcy was not of disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
 and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
 than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
 there were other evils before her. she anticipated what would be felt in
 the family when her situation became known: she was aware that one
 liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
 _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
 
at night she opened her heart to jane. though suspicion was very far
 from miss bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
 
“you are joking, lizzy. this cannot be! engaged to mr. darcy! no, no,
 you shall not deceive me: i know it to be impossible.”
 
“this is wretched beginning, indeed! my sole dependence was on you;
 and i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. yet, indeed, i
 am in earnest. i speak nothing but the truth. still loves me, and we
 are engaged.”
 
jane looked at her doubtingly. “oh, lizzy! it cannot be. i know how much
 you dislike him.”
 
“you know nothing of the matter. _that_ is all to be forgot. perhaps i
 did not always love him so well as i do now; but in such cases as these
 good memory is unpardonable. this is the last time i shall ever
 remember it myself.”
 
miss bennet still looked all amazement. elizabeth again, and more
 seriously, assured her of its truth.
 
“good heaven! can it be really so? yet now i must believe you,” cried
 jane. “my dear, dear lizzy, i would, i do congratulate you; but are you
 certain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
 happy with him?”
 
“there can be doubt of that. it is settled between us already that we
 are to be the happiest couple in the world. but are you pleased, jane?
 shall you like to have such brother?”
 
“very, very much. nothing could give either bingley or myself more
 delight. but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. and do you
 really love him quite well enough? oh, lizzy! do anything rather than
 marry without affection. are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
 to do?”
 
“oh, yes! you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do when i
 tell you all.”
 
“what do you mean?”
 
“why, i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley. i am
 afraid you will be angry.”
 
“my dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. i want to talk very seriously.
 let know everything that i am to know without delay. will you tell me
 how long you have loved him?”
 
“it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began;
 but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
 at pemberley.”
 
another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
 desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of
 attachment. when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing
 further to wish.
 
“now i am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. i
 always had value for him. were it for nothing but his love of you, i
 must always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley’s friend and your
 husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me. but,
 lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. how little did you
 tell of what passed at pemberley and lambton! i owe all that i know
 of it to another, not to you.”
 
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. she had been unwilling to
 mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
 her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would longer
 conceal from her his share in lydia’s marriage. all was acknowledged,
 and half the night spent in conversation.
 
“good gracious!” cried mrs. bennet, as she stood at window the next
 morning, “if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with
 our dear bingley! what can mean by being so tiresome as to be always
 coming here? i had notion but would go a-shooting, or something or
 other, and not disturb us with his company. what shall we do with him?
 lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that may not be in bingley’s
 way.”
 
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient proposal; yet
 was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
 epithet.
 
as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and
 shook hands with such warmth, as left doubt of his good information;
 and soon afterwards said aloud, “mrs. bennet, have you more lanes
 hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”
 
“i advise mr. darcy, and lizzy, and kitty,” said mrs. bennet, “to walk
 to oakham mount this morning. it is nice long walk, and mr. darcy has
 never seen the view.”
 
“it may do very well for the others,” replied mr. bingley; “but i am
 sure it will be too much for kitty. won’t it, kitty?”
 
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. darcy professed great
 curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently
 consented. as she went upstairs to get ready, mrs. bennet followed her,
 saying,--
 
“i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
 disagreeable man all to yourself; but i hope you will not mind it. it is
 all for jane’s sake, you know; and there is occasion for talking to
 him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”
 
during their walk, it was resolved that mr. bennet’s consent should be
 asked in the course of the evening: elizabeth reserved to herself the
 application for her mother’s. she could not determine how her mother
 would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
 would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she
 were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
 was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
 her sense; and she could more bear that mr. darcy should hear the
 first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
 disapprobation.
 
in the evening, soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
 mr. darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
 extreme. she did not fear her father’s opposition, but was going to
 be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,
 his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
 filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was wretched
 reflection, and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again, when,
 looking at him, she was little relieved by his smile. in few minutes
 approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while
 pretending to admire her work, said in whisper, “go to your father; he
 wants you in the library.” she was gone directly.
 
her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
 “lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? are you out of your senses to be
 accepting this man? have not you always hated him?”
 
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
 reasonable, her expressions more moderate! it would have spared her from
 explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
 but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
 of her attachment to mr. darcy.
 
“or, in other words, you are determined to have him. is rich, to be
 sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.
 but will they make you happy?”
 
“have you any other objection,” said elizabeth, “than your belief of my
 indifference?”
 
“none at all. we all know him to be proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
 this would be nothing if you really liked him.”
 
“i do, i do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “i love him.
 indeed has improper pride. is perfectly amiable. you do not
 know what really is; then pray do not pain by speaking of him in
 such terms.”
 
“lizzy,” said her father, “i have given him my consent. is the kind
 of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse anything, which he
 condescended to ask. i now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
 having him. but let advise you to think better of it. i know your
 disposition, lizzy. i know that you could be neither happy nor
 respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked
 up to him as superior. your lively talents would place you in the
 greatest danger in an unequal marriage. you could scarcely escape
 discredit and misery. my child, let not have the grief of seeing
 _you_ unable to respect your partner in life. you know not what you are
 about.”
 
elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
 and, at length, by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the
 object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
 estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
 his affection was not the work of day, but had stood the test of many
 months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,
 she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the
 match.
 
“well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “i have more to
 say. if this be the case, deserves you. i could not have parted with
 you, my lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”
 
to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr. darcy
 had voluntarily done for lydia. heard her with astonishment.
 
“this is an evening of wonders, indeed! and so, darcy did everything;
 made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him
 his commission! so much the better. it will save world of trouble
 and economy. had it been your uncle’s doing, i must and _would_ have
 paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own
 way. i shall offer to pay him to-morrow, will rant and storm about
 his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”
 
then recollected her embarrassment few days before on his reading
 mr. collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
 at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “if any young men come
 for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure.”
 
elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from very heavy weight; and, after
 half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
 the others with tolerable composure. everything was too recent for
 gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was longer
 anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
 would come in time.
 
when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
 and made the important communication. its effect was most extraordinary;
 for, on first hearing it, mrs. bennet sat quite still, and unable to
 utter syllable. nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could
 comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what
 was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
 lover to any of them. she began at length to recover, to fidget about in
 her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.
 
“good gracious! lord bless me! only think! dear me! mr. darcy! who would
 have thought it? and is it really true? oh, my sweetest lizzy! how rich
 and how great you will be! what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
 you will have! jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. i am so
 pleased--so happy. such charming man! so handsome! so tall! oh, my
 dear lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. i
 hope will overlook it. dear, dear lizzy. house in town! everything
 that is charming! three daughters married! ten thousand year! oh,
 lord! what will become of me? i shall go distracted.”
 
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and
 elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
 soon went away. but before she had been three minutes in her own room,
 her mother followed her.
 
“my dearest child,” she cried, “i can think of nothing else. ten
 thousand year, and very likely more! ’tis as good as lord! and a
 special licence--you must and shall be married by special licence.
 but, my dearest love, tell what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond
 of, that i may have it to-morrow.”
 
this was sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman
 himself might be; and elizabeth found that, though in the certain
 possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’
 consent, there was still something to be wished for. but the morrow
 passed off much better than she expected; for mrs. bennet luckily stood
 in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
 to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
 her deference for his opinion.
 
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
 acquainted with him; and mr. bennet soon assured her that was rising
 every hour in his esteem.
 
“i admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “wickham, perhaps,
 is my favourite; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well
 as jane’s.”

chapter lx.
 

[illustration]
 
elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr.
 darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “how could
 you begin?” said she. “i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
 you had once made beginning; but what could set you off in the first
 place?”
 
“i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
 laid the foundation. it is too long ago. i was in the middle before i
 knew that i _had_ begun.”
 
“my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
 to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke
 to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. now, be
 sincere; did you admire for my impertinence?”
 
“for the liveliness of your mind i did.”
 
“you may as well call it impertinence at once. it was very little less.
 the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
 attention. you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
 and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. i roused and
 interested you, because i was so unlike _them_. had you not been really
 amiable you would have hated for it: but in spite of the pains you
 took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
 in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
 courted you. there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
 and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly
 reasonable. to be sure you know actual good of me--but nobody thinks
 of _that_ when they fall in love.”
 
“was there good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was
 ill at netherfield?”
 
“dearest jane! who could have done less for her? but make virtue of it
 by all means. my good qualities are under your protection, and you are
 to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
 to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
 be; and i shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling
 to come to the point at last? what made you so shy of me, when you
 first called, and afterwards dined here? why, especially, when you
 called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”
 
“because you were grave and silent, and gave encouragement.”
 
“but i was embarrassed.”
 
“and so was i.”
 
“you might have talked to more when you came to dinner.”
 
“a man who had felt less might.”
 
“how unlucky that you should have reasonable answer to give, and that
 i should be so reasonable as to admit it! but i wonder how long you
 _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. i wonder when
 you _would_ have spoken if i had not asked you! my resolution of
 thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect. _too
 much_, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
 springs from breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the
 subject? this will never do.”
 
“you need not distress yourself. the moral will be perfectly fair. lady
 catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
 removing all my doubts. i am not indebted for my present happiness to
 your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. i was not in humour to
 wait for an opening of yours. my aunt’s intelligence had given hope,
 and i was determined at once to know everything.”
 
“lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
 for she loves to be of use. but tell me, what did you come down to
 netherfield for? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?
 or had you intended any more serious consequences?”
 
“my real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if i could, whether i
 might ever hope to make you love me. my avowed one, or what i avowed to
 myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to bingley, and
 if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made.”
 
“shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to
 befall her?”
 
“i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth. but it ought to
 be done; and if you will give sheet of paper it shall be done
 directly.”
 
“and if i had not letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and
 admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. but
 i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”
 
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy
 had been overrated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner’s
 long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
 be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt
 had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
 follows:--
 
“i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done,
 for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the
 truth, i was too cross to write. you supposed more than really existed.
 but _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give loose to your fancy,
 indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
 afford, and unless you believe actually married, you cannot greatly
 err. you must write again very soon, and praise him great deal more
 than you did in your last. i thank you again and again, for not going to
 the lakes. how could i be so silly as to wish it! your idea of the
 ponies is delightful. we will go round the park every day. i am the
 happiest creature in the world. perhaps other people have said so
 before, but one with such justice. i am happier even than jane; she
 only smiles, i laugh. mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that
 can be spared from me. you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.
 yours,” etc.
 
mr. darcy’s letter to lady catherine was in different style, and still
 different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins, in return
 for his last.
 
/* “dear sir, */
 
“i must trouble you once more for congratulations. elizabeth will
 soon be the wife of mr. darcy. console lady catherine as well as
 you can. but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew. has
 more to give.
 
“yours sincerely,” etc.
 
miss bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching
 marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. she wrote even to
 jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former
 professions of regard. jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and
 though feeling reliance on her, could not help writing her much
 kinder answer than she knew was deserved.
 
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was
 as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. four sides of paper were
 insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
 being loved by her sister.
 
before any answer could arrive from mr. collins, or any congratulations
 to elizabeth from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the
 collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge. the reason of this
 sudden removal was soon evident. lady catherine had been rendered so
 exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that
 charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
 the storm was blown over. at such moment, the arrival of her friend
 was sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their
 meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
 saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
 husband. bore it, however, with admirable calmness. could even
 listen to sir william lucas, when complimented him on carrying away
 the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
 meeting frequently at st. james’s, with very decent composure. if did
 shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.
 
mrs. philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, greater tax on his
 forbearance; and though mrs. philips, as well as her sister, stood in
 too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley’s
 good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be
 vulgar. nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at
 all likely to make her more elegant. elizabeth did all she could to
 shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to
 keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom might
 converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings
 arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its
 pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward
 with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so
 little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their
 family party at pemberley.

chapter lxi.

happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got
 rid of her two most deserving daughters. with what delighted pride she
 afterwards visited mrs. bingley, and talked of mrs. darcy, may be
 guessed. i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the
 accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of
 her children produced so happy an effect as to make her sensible,
 amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,
 it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic
 felicity in so unusual form, that she still was occasionally nervous
 and invariably silly.
 
mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
 drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. delighted in
 going to pemberley, especially when was least expected.
 
mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only twelvemonth. so near
 vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
 _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. the darling wish of his
 sisters was then gratified: bought an estate in neighbouring county
 to derbyshire; and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source
 of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
 
kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
 her two elder sisters. in society so superior to what she had generally
 known, her improvement was great. she was not of so ungovernable a
 temper as lydia; and, removed from the influence of lydia’s example, she
 became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
 ignorant, and less insipid. from the further disadvantage of lydia’s
 society she was of course carefully kept; and though mrs. wickham
 frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
 balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.
 
mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
 drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet’s being quite
 unable to sit alone. mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
 she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
 longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,
 it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
 much reluctance.
 
as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered revolution from
 the marriage of her sisters. bore with philosophy the conviction that
 elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
 and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of
 everything, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be
 prevailed on to make his fortune. the congratulatory letter which
 elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by
 his wife at least, if not by himself, such hope was cherished. the
 letter was to this effect:--
 
/* “my dear lizzy, */
 
“i wish you joy. if you love mr. darcy half so well as i do my dear
 wickham, you must be very happy. it is great comfort to have you
 so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will
 think of us. i am sure wickham would like place at court very
 much; and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
 upon without some help. any place would do of about three or four
 hundred year; but, however, do not speak to mr. darcy about it,
 if you had rather not.
 
“yours,” etc.
 
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in
 her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
 such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
 of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she
 frequently sent them. it had always been evident to her that such an
 income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
 their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
 their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or
 herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards
 discharging their bills. their manner of living, even when the
 restoration of peace dismissed them to home, was unsettled in the
 extreme. they were always moving from place to place in quest of a
 cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. his affection
 for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted little longer; and,
 in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
 reputation which her marriage had given her. though darcy could never
 receive _him_ at pemberley, yet, for elizabeth’s sake, assisted him
 further in his profession. lydia was occasionally visitor there, when
 her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath; and with the
 bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even
 bingley’s good-humour was overcome, and proceeded so far as to _talk_
 of giving them hint to be gone.
 
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy’s marriage; but as she
 thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she
 dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as
 attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
 to elizabeth.
 
pemberley was now georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters
 was exactly what darcy had hoped to see. they were able to love each
 other, even as well as they intended. georgiana had the highest opinion
 in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
 astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of
 talking to her brother. he, who had always inspired in herself respect
 which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
 pleasantry. her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
 her way. by elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a
 woman may take liberties with her husband, which brother will not
 always allow in sister more than ten years younger than himself.
 
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
 and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
 her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
 language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time
 all intercourse was at an end. but at length, by elizabeth’s persuasion,
 was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek reconciliation;
 and, after little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
 resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
 to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
 them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
 received, not merely from the presence of such mistress, but the
 visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.
 
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. darcy,
 as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
 sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
 her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
