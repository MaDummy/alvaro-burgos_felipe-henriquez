_3 may. bistritz._--left munich 8:35 p. m., 1st may, arriving at

 east north. going among latter, claim descended

day long seemed dawdle country full of
 beauty every kind. sometimes saw little towns castles the
 top steep hills see old missals; sometimes ran by
 rivers streams seemed wide stony margin side
 subject great floods. takes lot water, and
 running strong, sweep outside edge river clear. every
 station groups people, sometimes crowds, sorts
 attire. just like peasants home i
 saw coming france germany, short jackets round hats
 home-made trousers; others picturesque. women
 looked pretty, except got near them, clumsy
 waist. full white sleeves kind other,
 big belts lot strips something
 fluttering like dresses ballet, course there
 petticoats them. strangest figures saw the
 slovaks, barbarian rest, big cow-boy
 hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, enormous
 heavy leather belts, nearly foot wide, studded brass
 nails. wore high boots, trousers tucked them, and
 long black hair heavy black moustaches. very
 picturesque, look prepossessing. stage be
 set old oriental band brigands. are,
 however, told, harmless rather wanting natural
 self-assertion.
 
dark side twilight got bistritz, a
 interesting old place. practically frontier--for the
 borgo pass leads bukovina--it stormy
 existence, certainly shows marks it. fifty years ago series
 great fires took place, made terrible havoc five separate
 occasions. beginning seventeenth century underwent
 siege three weeks lost 13,000 people, casualties war

 cheery-looking elderly woman usual peasant dress--white
 undergarment long double apron, front, back, coloured stuff
 fitting almost tight modesty. came close bowed and
 said, “the herr englishman?” “yes,” said, “jonathan harker.” she
 smiled, gave message elderly man white shirt-sleeves,

“your friend,

_4 may._--i found landlord got letter count,
 directing secure best place coach me; on
 making inquiries details seemed somewhat reticent, and
 pretended understand german. be
 true, understood perfectly; least, he
 answered questions exactly did. wife, old
 lady received me, looked frightened sort of
 way. mumbled money sent letter, that
 knew. asked knew count dracula, could
 tell anything castle, wife crossed themselves,
 and, saying knew nothing all, simply refused speak
 further. near time starting time ask
 one else, mysterious means
 comforting.
 
just leaving, old lady came room said a
 hysterical way:
 
“must go? oh! young herr, must go?” excited
 state seemed lost grip german knew, and
 mixed language know all. i
 just able follow asking many questions. told her
 must go once, engaged important business,
 asked again:
 
“do know day is?” answered fourth may.
 shook head said again:
 
“oh, yes! know that! know that, know day is?” on
 saying understand, went on:
 
“it eve st. george’s day. know to-night, when
 clock strikes midnight, evil things world will have
 full sway? know going, going to?”
 evident distress tried comfort her, but
 without effect. finally went knees implored not
 go; least wait day two starting. very
 ridiculous feel comfortable. however, business
 done, allow nothing interfere it. therefore
 tried raise up, said, gravely could, thanked
 her, duty imperative, must go. rose and
 dried eyes, taking crucifix neck offered me. i

_5 may. castle._--the grey morning passed, sun is
 high distant horizon, seems jagged, whether trees or
 hills know not, far big things little are
 mixed. sleepy, and, called till awake,
 naturally write till sleep comes. many odd things put
 down, and, lest reads may fancy dined well i
 left bistritz, let put dinner exactly. dined they
 called “robber steak”--bits bacon, onion, beef, seasoned red
 pepper, strung sticks roasted fire, simple
 style london cat’s meat! wine golden mediasch, which
 produces queer sting tongue, is, however, not
 disagreeable. couple glasses this, nothing else.
 
got coach driver taken seat, saw him
 talking landlady. evidently talking me, every
 now looked me, people sitting
 bench outside door--which call name meaning
 “word-bearer”--came listened, looked me, them
 pityingly. hear lot words often repeated, queer words, for
 many nationalities crowd; quietly got polyglot
 dictionary bag looked out. must say not
 cheering me, amongst “ordog”--satan, “pokol”--hell,
 “stregoica”--witch, “vrolok” “vlkoslak”--both mean same
 thing, one slovak servian something is
 either were-wolf vampire. (_mem._, must ask count these
 superstitions)
 
started, crowd round inn door, time
 swelled considerable size, made sign cross and
 pointed two fingers towards me. difficulty got a
 fellow-passenger tell meant; answer at
 first, learning english, explained a
 charm guard evil eye. pleasant me,
 just starting unknown place meet unknown man; every one
 seemed kind-hearted, sorrowful, sympathetic i
 touched. shall never forget last glimpse i
 inn-yard crowd picturesque figures, crossing
 themselves, stood round wide archway, background of
 rich foliage oleander orange trees green tubs clustered the
 centre yard. driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
 whole front box-seat--“gotza” call them--cracked big
 whip four small horses, ran abreast, set on
 journey.
 
soon lost sight recollection ghostly fears beauty the
 scene drove along, although known language, rather
 languages, fellow-passengers speaking, might have
 able throw easily. us lay green sloping
 land full forests woods, steep hills, crowned
 clumps trees farmhouses, blank gable end the
 road. everywhere bewildering mass fruit blossom--apple,
 plum, pear, cherry; drove see green grass under
 trees spangled fallen petals. amongst these
 green hills call “mittel land” ran road,
 losing swept round grassy curve, shut the
 straggling ends pine woods, ran the
 hillsides like tongues flame. road rugged, still we
 seemed fly feverish haste. understand then
 haste meant, driver evidently bent losing no
 time reaching borgo prund. told road summertime
 excellent, yet put order winter
 snows. respect different general run roads in
 carpathians, old tradition kept
 good order. old hospadars repair them, lest the
 turk think preparing bring foreign troops,
 hasten war always really loading point.
 
beyond green swelling hills mittel land rose mighty slopes
 forest lofty steeps carpathians themselves. right
 left us towered, afternoon sun falling full upon
 bringing glorious colours beautiful range,
 deep blue purple shadows peaks, green brown where
 grass rock mingled, endless perspective jagged rock and
 pointed crags, till lost distance, where
 snowy peaks rose grandly. seemed mighty rifts the
 mountains, which, sun began sink, saw now again
 white gleam falling water. one companions touched arm as
 swept round base hill opened lofty, snow-covered
 peak mountain, seemed, wound serpentine way, to
 right us:--
 
“look! isten szek!”--“god’s seat!”--and crossed reverently.
 
wound endless way, sun sank lower lower behind
 us, shadows evening began creep round us. was
 emphasised fact snowy mountain-top still held the
 sunset, seemed glow delicate cool pink. there
 passed cszeks slovaks, picturesque attire, noticed
 goitre painfully prevalent. roadside many crosses,
 swept by, companions crossed themselves. there
 peasant man woman kneeling shrine, even
 turn round approached, seemed self-surrender of
 devotion neither eyes ears outer world. were
 many things new me: instance, hay-ricks trees, here
 beautiful masses weeping birch, white stems
 shining like silver delicate green leaves. now and
 passed leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant’s cart--with its
 long, snake-like vertebra, calculated suit inequalities the
 road. sure seated quite group home-coming
 peasants, cszeks white, slovaks their
 coloured, sheepskins, latter carrying lance-fashion long
 staves, axe end. evening fell began get cold,
 growing twilight seemed merge one dark mistiness the
 gloom trees, oak, beech, pine, though valleys which
 ran deep spurs hills, ascended the
 pass, dark firs stood background of
 late-lying snow. sometimes, road cut pine woods
 seemed darkness closing upon us, great masses of
 greyness, bestrewed trees, produced a
 peculiarly weird solemn effect, carried thoughts and
 grim fancies engendered earlier evening, falling sunset
 threw strange relief ghost-like clouds amongst the
 carpathians seem wind ceaselessly valleys. sometimes the
 hills steep that, despite driver’s haste, horses could
 go slowly. wished get walk them, home,
 driver hear it. “no, no,” said; “you must not
 walk here; dogs fierce”; added, he
 evidently meant grim pleasantry--for looked round catch the
 approving smile rest--“and may enough matters
 go sleep.” stop make moment’s
 pause light lamps.
 
grew dark seemed excitement amongst the
 passengers, kept speaking him, one other, as
 though urging speed. lashed horses unmercifully
 long whip, wild cries encouragement urged on
 exertions. darkness see sort of
 patch grey light ahead us, though cleft the
 hills. excitement passengers grew greater; crazy coach
 rocked great leather springs, swayed like boat tossed a
 stormy sea. hold on. road grew level, appeared
 fly along. mountains seemed come nearer us each
 side frown upon us; entering borgo pass. one
 one several passengers offered gifts, pressed
 upon earnestness take denial; were
 certainly odd varied kind, given simple good
 faith, kindly word, blessing, strange mixture of
 fear-meaning movements seen outside hotel at
 bistritz--the sign cross guard evil eye.
 then, flew along, driver leaned forward, side the
 passengers, craning edge coach, peered eagerly the
 darkness. evident something exciting either
 happening expected, though asked passenger, one would
 give slightest explanation. state excitement kept for
 little time; last saw us pass opening on
 eastern side. dark, rolling clouds overhead, the
 air heavy, oppressive sense thunder. seemed though the
 mountain range separated two atmospheres, now got
 thunderous one. now looking conveyance
 take count. moment expected see the
 glare lamps blackness; dark. light
 flickering rays lamps, steam our
 hard-driven horses rose white cloud. see now sandy
 road lying white us, sign vehicle.
 passengers drew back sigh gladness, seemed mock
 disappointment. already thinking best do, when
 driver, looking watch, said others something i
 hardly hear, spoken quietly low tone; i
 thought “an hour less time.” turning me, said
 german worse own:--
 
“there carriage here. herr expected all. will
 now come bukovina, return to-morrow next day; better
 next day.” whilst speaking horses began neigh and
 snort plunge wildly, driver hold up. then,
 amongst chorus screams peasants universal crossing
 themselves, calèche, four horses, drove behind us, overtook
 us, drew beside coach. see flash our
 lamps, rays fell them, horses coal-black and
 splendid animals. driven tall man, long brown
 beard great black hat, seemed hide face us. i
 see gleam pair bright eyes, seemed red
 lamplight, turned us. said driver:--
 
“you early to-night, friend.” man stammered reply:--
 
“the english herr hurry,” stranger replied:--
 
“that why, suppose, wished go bukovina. cannot
 deceive me, friend; know much, horses swift.” he
 spoke smiled, lamplight fell hard-looking mouth, with
 red lips sharp-looking teeth, white ivory. one my
 companions whispered another line burger’s “lenore”:--
 
“denn die todten reiten schnell”--
 (“for dead travel fast.”)
 
strange driver evidently heard words, looked a
 gleaming smile. passenger turned face away, time
 putting two fingers crossing himself. “give herr’s
 luggage,” said driver; exceeding alacrity bags were
 handed put calèche. descended side the
 coach, calèche close alongside, driver helping a
 hand caught arm grip steel; strength must been
 prodigious. without word shook reins, horses turned, we
 swept darkness pass. looked back saw steam
 horses coach light lamps, projected
 figures late companions crossing themselves. then
 driver cracked whip called horses, swept
 way bukovina. sank darkness felt a
 strange chill, lonely feeling came me; cloak thrown
 shoulders, rug across knees, driver said in
 excellent german:--
 
“the night chill, mein herr, master count bade take all
 care you. flask slivovitz (the plum brandy the
 country) underneath seat, require it.” take
 any, comfort know same. felt a
 little strangely, little frightened. think been
 alternative taken it, instead prosecuting that
 unknown night journey. carriage went hard pace straight along,
 made complete turn went along another straight road. it
 seemed simply going ground
 again; took note salient point, found was
 so. liked asked driver meant, but
 really feared so, thought that, placed was, any
 protest effect case intention to
 delay. by-and-by, however, curious know time was
 passing, struck match, flame looked watch; was
 within minutes midnight. gave sort shock, i
 suppose general superstition midnight increased my
 recent experiences. waited sick feeling suspense.
 
dog began howl somewhere farmhouse far road--a
 long, agonised wailing, fear. sound taken by
 another dog, another another, till, borne wind which
 now sighed softly pass, wild howling began, seemed
 come country, far imagination grasp
 gloom night. first howl horses began to
 strain rear, driver spoke soothingly, they
 quieted down, shivered sweated though runaway from
 sudden fright. then, far distance, mountains each
 side us began louder sharper howling--that wolves--which
 affected horses way--for minded to
 jump calèche run, whilst reared plunged
 madly, driver use great strength keep them
 bolting. minutes, however, ears got accustomed to
 sound, horses far became quiet driver able
 descend stand them. petted soothed them, and
 whispered something ears, heard horse-tamers
 doing, extraordinary effect, caresses became
 quite manageable again, though still trembled. driver again
 took seat, shaking reins, started great pace. this
 time, going far side pass, suddenly turned a
 narrow roadway ran sharply right.
 
soon hemmed trees, places arched right the
 roadway till passed tunnel; great frowning
 rocks guarded us boldly either side. though shelter, we
 hear rising wind, moaned whistled the
 rocks, branches trees crashed together swept along.
 grew colder colder still, fine, powdery snow began fall,
 soon around us covered white blanket. the
 keen wind still carried howling dogs, though grew
 fainter went way. baying wolves sounded nearer
 nearer, though closing round us every side. i
 grew dreadfully afraid, horses shared fear. driver,
 however, least disturbed; kept turning head to
 left right, see anything darkness.
 
suddenly, away left, saw faint flickering blue flame. the
 driver saw moment; checked horses, and,
 jumping ground, disappeared darkness. know
 do, less howling wolves grew closer; while
 wondered driver suddenly appeared again, without word took
 seat, resumed journey. think must fallen asleep
 kept dreaming incident, seemed repeated
 endlessly, now looking back, like sort awful nightmare.
 flame appeared near road, even darkness
 around us watch driver’s motions. went rapidly where
 blue flame arose--it must faint, seem
 illumine place around all--and gathering stones,
 formed device. appeared strange optical
 effect: stood flame obstruct it,
 see ghostly flicker same. startled me, but
 effect momentary, took eyes deceived me
 straining darkness. time blue
 flames, sped onwards gloom, howling the
 wolves around us, though following moving circle.
 
last came time driver went afield he
 yet gone, absence, horses began tremble worse
 ever snort scream fright. see cause
 it, howling wolves ceased altogether; just
 moon, sailing black clouds, appeared behind the
 jagged crest beetling, pine-clad rock, light saw
 around us ring wolves, white teeth lolling red tongues,
 long, sinewy limbs shaggy hair. hundred times more
 terrible grim silence held even howled.
 myself, felt sort paralysis fear. man
 feels face face horrors can understand
 true import.
 
wolves began howl though moonlight had
 peculiar effect them. horses jumped reared, and
 looked helplessly round eyes rolled way painful see;
 living ring terror encompassed every side; they
 perforce remain within it. called coachman come, for
 seemed chance try break the
 ring aid approach. shouted beat side the
 calèche, hoping noise scare wolves side, as
 give chance reaching trap. came there, know
 not, heard voice raised tone imperious command, and
 looking towards sound, saw stand roadway. swept his
 long arms, though brushing aside impalpable obstacle, wolves
 fell back back still. just heavy cloud passed across
 face moon, darkness.
 
see driver climbing calèche, the
 wolves disappeared. strange uncanny a
 dreadful fear came upon me, afraid speak move. time
 seemed interminable swept way, now almost complete
 darkness, rolling clouds obscured moon. kept on
 ascending, occasional periods quick descent, main
 always ascending. suddenly, became conscious fact the
 driver act pulling horses courtyard a
 vast ruined castle, whose tall black windows came ray light,
 whose broken battlements showed jagged line moonlit
 sky.

_5 may._--i must asleep, certainly fully
 awake must noticed approach remarkable place. in
 gloom courtyard looked considerable size, several dark
 ways led great round arches, perhaps seemed bigger than

calèche stopped, driver jumped held hand

 strength. hand actually seemed like steel vice have
 crushed mine chosen. took traps, placed
 ground beside stood close great door, old and
 studded large iron nails, set projecting doorway of
 massive stone. see even dim light stone was
 massively carved, carving much worn time and
 weather. stood, driver jumped seat shook the
 reins; horses started forward, trap disappeared one

stood silence was, know do. bell
 knocker sign; frowning walls dark
 window openings likely voice penetrate. the
 time waited seemed endless, felt doubts fears crowding upon
 me. sort place come to, among kind people?
 sort grim adventure embarked? a
 customary incident life solicitor’s clerk sent to
 explain purchase london estate foreigner? solicitor’s
 clerk! mina like that. solicitor--for just leaving
 london got word examination successful; now a
 full-blown solicitor! began rub eyes pinch see if
 awake. seemed like horrible nightmare me, i
 expected suddenly awake, find home, with
 dawn struggling windows, now felt
 morning day overwork. flesh answered the
 pinching test, eyes deceived. indeed awake
 among carpathians. now patient, to
 wait coming morning.
 
just come conclusion heard heavy step approaching
 behind great door, saw chinks gleam coming
 light. sound rattling chains clanking of
 massive bolts drawn back. key turned loud grating noise
 long disuse, great door swung back.
 
within, stood tall old man, clean shaven save long white
 moustache, clad black head foot, without single speck
 colour anywhere. held hand antique silver
 lamp, flame burned without chimney globe kind,
 throwing long quivering shadows flickered draught the
 open door. old man motioned right hand courtly
 gesture, saying excellent english, strange intonation:--
 
“welcome house! enter freely will!” made no
 motion stepping meet me, stood like statue, though his
 gesture welcome fixed stone. instant, however, that
 stepped threshold, moved impulsively forward, and
 holding hand grasped mine strength made wince,

 ice--more like hand dead living man. said:--
 
“welcome house. come freely. go safely; leave something the
 happiness bring!” strength handshake much akin to

 moment doubted person was

“count dracula?” bowed courtly way replied:--
 
“i dracula; bid welcome, mr. harker, house. come in;
 night air chill, must need eat rest.” was
 speaking, put lamp bracket wall, stepping out,
 took luggage; carried forestall him. i
 protested insisted:--
 
“nay, sir, guest. late, people not

 traps along passage, great winding stair, and
 along another great passage, whose stone floor steps rang
 heavily. end threw open heavy door, rejoiced
 see within well-lit room table spread supper,
 whose mighty hearth great fire logs, freshly replenished,
 flamed flared.
 
count halted, putting bags, closed door, crossing
 room, opened another door, led small octagonal room lit
 single lamp, seemingly without window sort. passing
 this, opened another door, motioned enter. a
 welcome sight; great bedroom well lighted warmed with
 another log fire,--also added lately, top logs were
 fresh--which sent hollow roar wide chimney. count himself
 left luggage inside withdrew, saying, closed the
 door:--
 
“you will need, journey, refresh making your
 toilet. trust will find wish. ready, come

light warmth count’s courteous welcome seemed have
 dissipated doubts fears. reached normal state,
 discovered half famished hunger; making hasty
 toilet, went room.
 
found supper already laid out. host, stood one side the
 great fireplace, leaning stonework, made graceful wave of
 hand table, said:--
 
“i pray you, seated sup please. will, trust, excuse

handed sealed letter mr. hawkins entrusted me.
 opened read gravely; then, charming smile, handed

 pleasure.
 
“i must regret attack gout, malady constant

time finished supper, host’s desire drawn

 opportunity observing him, found marked
 physiognomy.

 thin nose peculiarly arched nostrils; lofty domed forehead, and
 hair growing scantily round temples profusely elsewhere. his
 eyebrows massive, almost meeting nose, bushy
 hair seemed curl profusion. mouth, far i

 cruel-looking, peculiarly sharp white teeth; protruded over

 horrible feeling nausea came me, which, would, could

 grim sort smile, showed yet done his
 protuberant teeth, sat side the
 fireplace. silent while; looked towards the
 window saw first dim streak coming dawn. seemed a
 strange stillness everything; listened heard from
 valley howling many wolves. count’s eyes
 gleamed, said:--
 
“listen them--the children night. music make!”

 added:--
 
“ah, sir, dwellers city enter feelings the

_7 may._--it early morning, rested enjoyed the
 last twenty-four hours. slept till late day, awoke my
 accord. dressed went room had
 supped, found cold breakfast laid out, coffee kept hot the
 pot placed hearth. card table, which
 written:--
 
“i absent while. wait me.--d.” set and
 enjoyed hearty meal. done, looked bell, i
 might let servants know finished; find one.
 certainly odd deficiencies house, considering the
 extraordinary evidences wealth round me. table service
 gold, beautifully wrought must immense value.
 curtains upholstery chairs sofas hangings of
 bed costliest beautiful fabrics, must have
 fabulous value made, centuries old,
 though excellent order. saw something like hampton court,
 worn frayed moth-eaten. still none of
 rooms mirror. even toilet glass my
 table, get little shaving glass bag i
 either shave brush hair. yet seen servant
 anywhere, heard sound near castle except howling wolves.
 time finished meal--i know whether call it
 breakfast dinner, five six o’clock had
 it--i looked something read, like go about
 castle asked count’s permission. was
 absolutely nothing room, book, newspaper, even writing
 materials; opened another door room found sort of
 library. door opposite mine tried, found locked.
 
library found, great delight, vast number english
 books, whole shelves full them, bound volumes magazines and
 newspapers. table centre littered english magazines
 newspapers, though none recent date. books
 varied kind--history, geography, politics, political
 economy, botany, geology, law--all relating england english life
 customs manners. even books reference the
 london directory, “red” “blue” books, whitaker’s almanac, the
 army navy lists, and--it somehow gladdened heart see it--the
 law list.
 
whilst looking books, door opened, count
 entered. saluted hearty way, hoped good
 night’s rest. went on:--
 
“i glad found way here, sure much that
 will interest you. companions”--and laid hand of
 books--“have good friends me, years past, ever
 since idea going london, given many, many hours
 pleasure. come know great england; to
 know love her. long go crowded streets of
 mighty london, midst whirl rush of
 humanity, share life, change, death, makes

course said willing, asked might

 added:--
 
“you may go anywhere wish castle, except doors are
 locked, course will wish go. reason that
 things are, see eyes know with
 knowledge, perhaps better understand.” said sure of
 this, went on:--
 
“we transylvania; transylvania england. ways are
 ways, shall many strange things. nay, from
 told experiences already, know something of
 strange things may be.”
 
led much conversation; evident wanted to
 talk, talking’s sake, asked many questions regarding
 things already happened come within notice.
 sometimes sheered subject, turned conversation by
 pretending understand; generally answered asked most
 frankly. time went on, got somewhat bolder, asked
 strange things preceding night, as, for
 instance, coachman went places seen blue
 flames. explained commonly believed a
 certain night year--last night, fact, evil spirits
 supposed unchecked sway--a blue flame seen place
 treasure concealed. “that treasure hidden,” he
 went on, “in region came last night, can be
 little doubt; ground fought centuries the
 wallachian, saxon, turk. why, hardly foot soil

 austrian hungarian came hordes, patriots went out

 coming rocks passes, might sweep
 destruction artificial avalanches. invader
 triumphant found little, whatever been
 sheltered friendly soil.”
 
“but how,” said i, “can remained long undiscovered, when
 sure index men will take trouble look?”
 count smiled, lips ran back gums, long,
 sharp, canine teeth showed strangely; answered:--
 
“because peasant heart coward fool! flames only
 appear one night; night man land will, he
 can help it, stir without doors. and, dear sir, even he
 know do. why, even peasant tell who
 marked place flame know look daylight
 even work. even not, dare sworn, able to
 find places again?”
 
“there right,” said. “i know dead even
 look them.” drifted matters.
 
“come,” said last, “tell london house you
 procured me.” apology remissness, went my
 room get papers bag. whilst placing in
 order heard rattling china silver next room, i
 passed through, noticed table cleared lamp
 lit, time deep dark. lamps also lit
 study library, found count lying sofa,
 reading, things world, english bradshaw’s guide. i
 came cleared books papers table; i
 went plans deeds figures sorts. interested in
 everything, asked myriad questions place its
 surroundings. clearly studied beforehand get the
 subject neighbourhood, evidently end knew much
 did. remarked this, answered:--
 
“well, but, friend, needful should? go there

 fall country’s habit putting patronymic first--my friend
 jonathan harker will side correct aid me. will be
 exeter, miles away, probably working papers law my
 friend, peter hawkins. so!”
 
went thoroughly business purchase estate at
 purfleet. told facts got signature the
 necessary papers, written letter ready post to
 mr. hawkins, began ask come across suitable a
 place. read notes made time, i
 inscribe here:--
 
“at purfleet, by-road, came across just place seemed to
 required, displayed dilapidated notice place
 sale. surrounded high wall, ancient structure,
 built heavy stones, repaired large number of
 years. closed gates heavy old oak iron, eaten with
 rust.
 
“the estate called carfax, doubt corruption old _quatre
 face_, house four-sided, agreeing cardinal points of
 compass. contains twenty acres, quite surrounded by
 solid stone wall mentioned. many trees it, which
 make places gloomy, deep, dark-looking pond or
 small lake, evidently fed springs, water clear and
 flows away fair-sized stream. house large all
 periods back, say, mediæval times, one part stone
 immensely thick, windows high heavily barred with
 iron. looks like part keep, close old chapel or

 various points. house added to, straggling

 large house recently added formed private lunatic
 asylum. not, however, visible grounds.”
 
finished, said:--
 
“i glad old big. old family, to

 also chapel old times. transylvanian nobles love
 think bones may lie amongst common dead. seek not

 heart, weary years mourning dead, not
 attuned mirth. moreover, walls castle broken; the
 shadows many, wind breathes cold broken
 battlements casements. love shade shadow, would

 seem accord, else cast face made his
 smile look malignant saturnine.
 
presently, excuse, left me, asking put papers
 together. little time away, began look of
 books around me. one atlas, found opened naturally at
 england, map much used. looking found in
 certain places little rings marked, examining noticed
 one near london east side, manifestly new
 estate situated; two exeter, whitby the
 yorkshire coast.
 
better part hour count returned. “aha!” he
 said; “still books? good! must work always. come; i
 informed supper ready.” took arm, went into
 next room, found excellent supper ready table. the
 count excused himself, dined away from
 home. sat previous night, chatted whilst ate.
 supper smoked, last evening, count stayed with
 me, chatting asking questions every conceivable subject, hour
 hour. felt getting late indeed, not
 say anything, felt obligation meet host’s wishes in
 every way. sleepy, long sleep yesterday fortified
 me; help experiencing chill comes one at
 coming dawn, like, way, turn tide.
 say people near death die generally change to
 dawn turn tide; one tired, and
 tied post, experienced change atmosphere
 can well believe it. heard crow cock coming up
 preternatural shrillness clear morning air; count
 dracula, jumping feet, said:--
 
“why, morning again! remiss let stay so
 long. must make conversation regarding dear new country of
 england less interesting, may forget time flies by
 us,” and, courtly bow, quickly left me.
 
went room drew curtains, little to
 notice; window opened courtyard, see the
 warm grey quickening sky. pulled curtains again, have
 written day.

_midnight._--i long talk count. asked few
 questions transylvania history, warmed subject
 wonderfully. speaking things people, especially of
 battles, spoke present all. he
 afterwards explained saying _boyar_ pride house

 spoke almost plural, like king speaking. wish put

 fascinating. seemed whole history country. he
 grew excited spoke, walked room pulling great
 white moustache grasping anything laid hands as

 shall put nearly can; tells way story of

time close morning, went bed. (_mem._, this
 diary seems horribly like beginning “arabian nights,” for
 everything break cockcrow--or like ghost hamlet’s

_12 may._--let begin facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by
 books figures, can doubt. must not
 confuse experiences will rest own
 observation, memory them. last evening count came from
 room began asking questions legal matters the
 certain kinds business. spent day wearily over
 books, and, simply keep mind occupied, went the
 matters examining lincoln’s inn. certain
 method count’s inquiries, shall try put in
 sequence; knowledge may somehow time useful me.
 
first, asked man england might two solicitors more. i
 told might dozen wished, be
 wise one solicitor engaged one transaction, only
 one act time, change certain militate
 interest. seemed thoroughly understand, went to
 ask practical difficulty one man to
 attend, say, banking, another look shipping, case
 local help needed place far home banking
 solicitor. asked explain fully, might any
 chance mislead him, said:--
 
“i shall illustrate. friend mine, mr. peter hawkins, under
 shadow beautiful cathedral exeter, far from
 london, buys good self place london. good! now
 let say frankly, lest think strange have
 sought services one far london instead one
 resident there, motive local interest might be
 served save wish only; one london residence might, perhaps,
 purpose friend serve, went thus afield to
 seek agent, whose labours interest. now, suppose
 i, much affairs, wish ship goods, say, newcastle, or
 durham, harwich, dover, might more
 ease done consigning one ports?” answered that
 certainly easy, solicitors system of
 agency one other, local work done locally on
 instruction solicitor, client, simply placing
 hands one man, wishes carried by
 without trouble.
 
“but,” said he, “i liberty direct myself. so?”
 
“of course,” replied; “such often done men business, who
 like whole affairs known one person.”
 
“good!” said, went ask means making
 consignments forms gone through, sorts of
 difficulties might arise, forethought guarded
 against. explained things best ability,
 certainly left impression made a
 wonderful solicitor, nothing think or
 foresee. man never country, not
 evidently much way business, knowledge acumen were
 wonderful. satisfied points had
 spoken, verified well books
 available, suddenly stood said:--
 
“have written since first letter friend mr. peter
 hawkins, other?” bitterness heart that
 answered not, yet seen opportunity of
 sending letters anybody.
 
“then write now, young friend,” said, laying heavy hand my
 shoulder: “write friend other; say, will
 please you, shall stay month now.”
 
“do wish stay long?” asked, heart grew cold the
 thought.
 
“i desire much; nay, will take refusal. master,
 employer, will, engaged someone come behalf,
 understood needs consulted. not
 stinted. so?”
 
bow acceptance? mr. hawkins’s interest, not
 mine, think him, myself; besides, count
 dracula speaking, eyes bearing
 made remember prisoner, wished i
 choice. count saw victory bow, his
 mastery trouble face, began use them, but
 smooth, resistless way:--
 
“i pray you, good young friend, will discourse things
 business letters. will doubtless please your
 friends know well, look forward getting
 home them. so?” spoke handed three sheets of
 note-paper three envelopes. thinnest foreign
 post, looking them, him, noticing quiet smile,
 sharp, canine teeth lying red underlip, understood
 well spoken careful wrote, for
 able read it. determined write formal notes
 now, write fully mr. hawkins secret, also mina, for
 write shorthand, puzzle count, he
 see it. written two letters sat quiet, reading a
 book whilst count wrote several notes, referring wrote to
 books table. took two placed his
 own, put writing materials, which, instant door
 closed behind him, leaned looked letters, which
 face table. felt compunction so, for
 circumstances felt protect every way
 could.
 
one letters directed samuel f. billington, no. 7, the
 crescent, whitby, another herr leutner, varna; third to
 coutts & co., london, fourth herren klopstock & billreuth,
 bankers, buda-pesth. second fourth unsealed. just
 look saw door-handle move. sank back my
 seat, just time replace letters and
 resume book count, holding still another letter his
 hand, entered room. took letters table stamped
 carefully, turning me, said:--
 
“i trust will forgive me, much work private this
 evening. will, hope, find things wish.” door he
 turned, moment’s pause said:--
 
“let advise you, dear young friend--nay, let warn all
 seriousness, leave rooms will any
 chance go sleep part castle. old, has
 many memories, bad dreams sleep unwisely. be
 warned! sleep now ever overcome you, like do, then
 haste chamber rooms, rest will be
 safe. careful respect, then”--he finished his
 speech gruesome way, motioned hands were
 washing them. quite understood; doubt whether any
 dream terrible unnatural, horrible net gloom
 mystery seemed closing around me.

written diary fortunately replaced book and
 pen pocket felt sleepy. count’s warning came mind,
 took pleasure disobeying it. sense sleep upon me,
 obstinacy sleep brings outrider. soft
 moonlight soothed, wide expanse without gave sense freedom

 real--so real now sitting broad, full sunlight the
 morning, least believe sleep.
 
alone. room same, unchanged way since i
 came it; see along floor, brilliant moonlight,
 footsteps marked disturbed long accumulation of
 dust. moonlight opposite three young women, ladies by
 dress manner. thought time must dreaming
 saw them, for, though moonlight behind them, threw
 shadow floor. came close me, looked some
 time, whispered together. two dark, high aquiline
 noses, like count, great dark, piercing eyes seemed be
 almost red contrasted pale yellow moon. was
 fair, fair can be, great wavy masses golden hair eyes
 like pale sapphires. seemed somehow know face, know it
 connection dreamy fear, recollect the
 moment where. three brilliant white teeth shone like
 pearls ruby voluptuous lips. something
 made uneasy, longing time some
 deadly fear. felt heart wicked, burning desire would
 kiss red lips. good note down, lest some
 day meet mina’s eyes cause pain; truth.
 whispered together, three laughed--such a
 silvery, musical laugh, hard though sound never have
 come softness human lips. like intolerable,
 tingling sweetness water-glasses played cunning hand.
 fair girl shook head coquettishly, two urged her
 on. one said:--
 
“go on! first, shall follow; right to
 begin.” added:--
 
“he young strong; kisses us all.” lay quiet,
 looking eyelashes agony delightful anticipation.
 fair girl advanced bent till feel movement

 closed eyes languorous ecstasy waited--waited beating
 heart.
 
instant, another sensation swept quick as
 lightning. conscious presence count, his
 lapped storm fury. eyes opened involuntarily i
 saw strong hand grasp slender neck fair woman with
 giant’s power draw back, blue eyes transformed fury, the
 white teeth champing rage, fair cheeks blazing red with
 passion. count! never imagine wrath fury, even to
 demons pit. eyes positively blazing. red light
 lurid, flames hell-fire blazed behind them. his
 face deathly pale, lines hard like drawn wires;
 thick eyebrows met nose now seemed like heaving bar
 white-hot metal. fierce sweep arm, hurled woman
 him, motioned others, though beating
 back; imperious gesture seen used the
 wolves. voice which, though low almost whisper seemed to
 cut air ring round room said:--
 
“how dare touch him, you? dare cast eyes when
 forbidden it? back, tell all! man belongs me! beware
 meddle him, you’ll deal me.” fair girl,
 laugh ribald coquetry, turned answer him:--
 
“you never loved; never love!” women
 joined, mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang the
 room almost made faint hear; seemed like pleasure
 fiends. count turned, looking face attentively,
 said soft whisper:--
 
“yes, can love; can tell past. it
 so? well, now promise done shall
 kiss will. now go! go! must awaken him, work
 done.”
 
“are nothing to-night?” said one them, low laugh,
 pointed bag thrown upon floor, which
 moved though living thing within it. answer he
 nodded head. one women jumped forward opened it. my
 ears deceive gasp low wail, a
 half-smothered child. women closed round, whilst aghast with
 horror; looked disappeared, dreadful
 bag. door near them, passed me
 without noticing. simply seemed fade rays the
 moonlight pass window, see outside the
 dim, shadowy forms moment entirely faded away.
 
horror overcame me, sank unconscious.

_17 june._--this morning, sitting edge bed
 cudgelling brains, heard without cracking whips pounding
 scraping horses’ feet rocky path beyond courtyard.
 joy hurried window, saw drive yard two great
 leiter-wagons, drawn eight sturdy horses, head of
 pair slovak, wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty
 sheepskin, high boots. also long staves hand. i
 ran door, intending descend try join the
 main hall, thought way might opened them. a
 shock: door fastened outside.
 
ran window cried them. looked me
 stupidly pointed, just “hetman” szgany came out,
 seeing pointing window, said something, they
 laughed. henceforth effort mine, piteous cry agonised
 entreaty, make even look me. resolutely turned away.
 leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, handles thick
 rope; evidently empty ease slovaks
 handled them, resonance roughly moved. when
 unloaded packed great heap one corner the
 yard, slovaks given money szgany, spitting on
 luck, lazily went horse’s head. shortly afterwards, i
 heard cracking whips die away distance.
 
* * * * *
 
_24 june, morning._--last night count left early, and
 locked room. soon dared ran the
 winding stair, looked window, opened south. i
 thought watch count, something going on.
 szgany quartered somewhere castle work of
 kind. know it, now hear far-away muffled sound
 mattock spade, and, whatever is, must end some
 ruthless villainy.
 
window somewhat less half hour, saw
 something coming count’s window. drew back watched
 carefully, saw whole man emerge. new shock to
 find suit clothes worn whilst
 travelling here, slung shoulder terrible bag i
 seen women take away. doubt quest,
 garb, too! this, then, new scheme evil: will
 allow others see me, think, may leave
 evidence seen towns villages posting own
 letters, wickedness may shall local
 people attributed me.
 
makes rage think can go on, whilst shut up
 here, veritable prisoner, without protection law which
 even criminal’s right consolation.
 
thought watch count’s return, long time sat
 doggedly window. began notice some
 quaint little specks floating rays moonlight. were
 like tiniest grains dust, whirled round gathered in
 clusters nebulous sort way. watched sense of
 soothing, sort calm stole me. leaned back the
 embrasure comfortable position, enjoy more
 fully aërial gambolling.
 
something made start up, low, piteous howling dogs somewhere far
 valley, hidden sight. louder seemed to
 ring ears, floating motes dust take new shapes to
 sound danced moonlight. felt struggling to
 awake call instincts; nay, soul struggling,
 half-remembered sensibilities striving answer call. i
 becoming hypnotised! quicker quicker danced dust; the
 moonbeams seemed quiver went mass gloom
 beyond. gathered till seemed take dim phantom
 shapes. started, broad awake full possession my
 senses, ran screaming place. phantom shapes, were
 becoming gradually materialised moonbeams, the
 three ghostly women doomed. fled, felt somewhat
 safer room, moonlight lamp
 burning brightly.
 
couple hours passed heard something stirring the
 count’s room, something like sharp wail quickly suppressed; then
 silence, deep, awful silence, chilled me. a
 beating heart, tried door; locked prison, and
 nothing. sat simply cried.
 
sat heard sound courtyard without--the agonised cry a
 woman. rushed window, throwing up, peered between
 bars. there, indeed, woman dishevelled hair, holding her
 hands heart one distressed running. leaning
 corner gateway. saw face window she
 threw forward, shouted voice laden menace:--
 
“monster, give child!”
 
threw knees, raising hands, cried same
 words tones wrung heart. tore hair beat her
 breast, abandoned violences extravagant
 emotion. finally, threw forward, and, though see
 her, hear beating naked hands door.
 
somewhere high overhead, probably tower, heard voice the
 count calling harsh, metallic whisper. call seemed be
 answered far wide howling wolves. many minutes
 passed pack poured, like pent-up dam liberated,
 wide entrance courtyard.
 
cry woman, howling wolves but
 short. long streamed away singly, licking lips.
 
pity her, knew now become child, and
 better dead.
 
shall do? can do? can escape dreadful
 thing night gloom fear?

_25 june, morning._--no man knows till suffered night
 sweet dear heart eye morning can be. the
 sun grew high morning struck top great
 gateway opposite window, high spot touched seemed me

 vaporous garment dissolved warmth. must

 night one post-dated letters went post, first fatal

 come safely back room. must put every detail order. i
 went whilst courage fresh straight window south

 took boots, ventured desperate way. looked down
 once, make sure sudden glimpse awful depth would
 overcome me, kept eyes away it. knew pretty
 well direction distance count’s window, made it
 well could, regard opportunities available. did
 feel dizzy--i suppose excited--and time seemed
 ridiculously short till found standing window-sill and
 trying raise sash. filled agitation, however, when
 bent slid feet foremost window. looked
 around count, but, surprise gladness, made discovery.
 room empty! barely furnished odd things, which
 seemed never used; furniture something same

 minding carefully went, stairs dark, lit
 loopholes heavy masonry. bottom dark,
 tunnel-like passage, came deathly, sickly odour, the
 odour old earth newly turned. went passage smell
 grew closer heavier. last pulled open heavy door stood
 ajar, found old, ruined chapel, evidently
 used graveyard. roof broken, two places were
 steps leading vaults, ground recently dug over, and
 earth placed great wooden boxes, manifestly been
 brought slovaks. nobody about, made search for
 outlet, none. went every inch of
 ground, lose chance. went even the
 vaults, dim light struggled, although dread to
 soul. two went, saw nothing except fragments
 old coffins piles dust; third, however, made a
 discovery.
 
there, one great boxes, fifty all, a
 pile newly dug earth, lay count! either dead asleep, i
 say which--for eyes open stony, without the

* * * * *
 
_29 june._--to-day date last letter, count has
 taken steps prove genuine, saw leave the
 castle window, clothes. went wall,
 lizard fashion, wished gun lethal weapon, might
 destroy him; fear weapon wrought alone man’s hand would
 effect him. dared wait see return, feared
 see weird sisters. came back library, read there
 till fell asleep.
 
awakened count, looked grimly man can
 look said:--
 
“to-morrow, friend, must part. return beautiful
 england, work may end may never
 meet. letter home despatched; to-morrow shall be
 here, shall ready journey. morning come the
 szgany, labours here, also come some
 slovaks. gone, carriage shall come you, shall
 bear borgo pass meet diligence bukovina to
 bistritz. hopes shall see castle
 dracula.” suspected him, determined test sincerity.
 sincerity! seems like profanation word write in
 connection monster, asked point-blank:--
 
“why may go to-night?”
 
“because, dear sir, coachman horses away mission.”
 
“but walk pleasure. want get away once.” smiled,
 soft, smooth, diabolical smile knew trick
 behind smoothness. said:--
 
“and baggage?”
 
“i care it. can send time.”
 
count stood up, said, sweet courtesy made rub my
 eyes, seemed real:--
 
“you english saying close heart, spirit is
 rules _boyars_: ‘welcome coming; speed parting
 guest.’ come me, dear young friend. hour shall wait
 house will, though sad going, that
 suddenly desire it. come!” stately gravity, he, the
 lamp, preceded stairs along hall. suddenly he
 stopped.
 
“hark!”
 
close hand came howling many wolves. almost the
 sound sprang rising hand, just music great
 orchestra seems leap bâton conductor. pause
 moment, proceeded, stately way, door, drew back
 ponderous bolts, unhooked heavy chains, began draw it
 open.
 
intense astonishment saw unlocked. suspiciously, i
 looked round, see key kind.
 
door began open, howling wolves without grew louder
 angrier; red jaws, champing teeth, blunt-clawed
 feet leaped, came opening door. knew that
 struggle moment count useless. such
 allies command, nothing. still door
 continued slowly open, count’s body stood gap.
 suddenly struck might moment means my
 doom; given wolves, instigation. there
 diabolical wickedness idea great enough count, and
 last chance cried out:--
 
“shut door; shall wait till morning!” covered face my
 hands hide tears bitter disappointment. one sweep his
 powerful arm, count threw door shut, great bolts clanged
 echoed hall shot back places.
 
silence returned library, minute two went
 room. last saw count dracula kissing hand
 me; red light triumph eyes, smile that
 judas hell might proud of.
 
room lie down, thought heard a
 whispering door. went softly listened. unless ears
 deceived me, heard voice count:--
 
“back, back, place! time yet come. wait! have
 patience! to-night mine. to-morrow night yours!” low,
 sweet ripple laughter, rage threw open door, saw
 without three terrible women licking lips. appeared they
 joined horrible laugh, ran away.
 
came back room threw knees. near
 end? to-morrow! to-morrow! lord, help me, am
 dear!
 
* * * * *
 
_30 june, morning._--these may last words ever write this
 diary. slept till just dawn, woke threw myself
 knees, determined death came find me
 ready.
 
last felt subtle change air, knew morning
 come. came welcome cock-crow, felt safe.
 glad heart, opened door ran hall. seen
 door unlocked, now escape me. hands
 trembled eagerness, unhooked chains drew back the
 massive bolts.
 
door move. despair seized me. pulled, pulled, at
 door, shook till, massive was, rattled its
 casement. see bolt shot. locked left the
 count.
 
wild desire took obtain key risk, i
 determined scale wall gain count’s
 room. might kill me, death now seemed happier choice of
 evils. without pause rushed east window, scrambled
 wall, before, count’s room. empty, that
 expected. see key anywhere, heap gold
 remained. went door corner winding
 stair along dark passage old chapel. knew now well
 enough find monster sought.
 
great box place, close wall, lid
 laid it, fastened down, nails ready their
 places hammered home. knew must reach body key, so
 raised lid, laid back wall; saw
 something filled soul horror. lay count,
 looking youth half renewed, white hair
 moustache changed dark iron-grey; cheeks fuller,
 white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; mouth redder than
 ever, lips gouts fresh blood, trickled the
 corners mouth ran chin neck. even deep,
 burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, lids pouches
 underneath bloated. seemed whole awful creature were
 simply gorged blood. lay like filthy leech, exhausted his
 repletion. shuddered bent touch him, every sense in
 revolted contact; search, lost. the
 coming night might see body banquet similar way those
 horrid three. felt body, sign find the
 key. stopped looked count. mocking smile
 bloated face seemed drive mad. i
 helping transfer london, where, perhaps, centuries come
 might, amongst teeming millions, satiate lust blood, and
 create new ever-widening circle semi-demons batten the
 helpless. thought drove mad. terrible desire came upon me
 rid world monster. lethal weapon hand,
 seized shovel workmen using fill the
 cases, lifting high, struck, edge downward, the
 hateful face. head turned, eyes fell full
 upon me, blaze basilisk horror. sight seemed to
 paralyse me, shovel turned hand glanced face,
 merely making deep gash forehead. shovel fell my
 hand across box, pulled away flange blade
 caught edge lid fell again, hid horrid
 thing sight. last glimpse bloated face,
 blood-stained fixed grin malice held its
 nethermost hell.
 
thought thought next move, brain seemed
 fire, waited despairing feeling growing me. i
 waited heard distance gipsy song sung merry voices coming
 closer, song rolling heavy wheels the
 cracking whips; szgany slovaks count had
 spoken coming. last look around box which
 contained vile body, ran place gained count’s
 room, determined rush moment door opened.
 strained ears, listened, heard downstairs grinding the
 key great lock falling back heavy door. must
 means entry, one key one of
 locked doors. came sound many feet tramping and
 dying away passage sent clanging echo. turned to
 run towards vault, might find new entrance;
 moment seemed come violent puff wind, the
 door winding stair blew shock set dust from
 lintels flying. ran push open, found was
 hopelessly fast. prisoner, net doom closing
 round closely.
 
write passage sound many tramping feet
 crash weights set heavily, doubtless boxes,
 freight earth. sound hammering; the
 box nailed down. now can hear heavy feet tramping again
 along hall, many idle feet coming behind them.
 
door shut, chains rattle; grinding key
 lock; can hear key withdraw: another door opens and
 shuts; hear creaking lock bolt.
 
hark! courtyard rocky way roll heavy wheels,
 crack whips, chorus szgany pass the
 distance.
 
alone castle awful women. faugh! mina woman,
 nought common. devils pit!
 
shall remain alone them; shall try scale castle wall
 farther yet attempted. shall take gold with
 me, lest want later. may find way dreadful place.
 
away home! away quickest nearest train! away
 cursed spot, cursed land, devil his
 children still walk earthly feet!
 
least god’s mercy better monsters, the
 precipice steep high. foot man may sleep--as man.
 good-bye, all! mina!

_24 july. whitby._--lucy met station, looking sweeter and
 lovelier ever, drove house crescent in
 rooms. lovely place. little river, the
 esk, runs deep valley, broadens comes near the
 harbour. great viaduct runs across, high piers, the
 view seems somehow away really is. valley is
 beautifully green, steep high land
 either side look right across it, unless near enough to
 see down. houses old town--the side away us--are all
 red-roofed, seem piled one anyhow, like the
 pictures see nuremberg. right town ruin whitby
 abbey, sacked danes, scene part of
 “marmion,” girl built wall. noble
 ruin, immense size, full beautiful romantic bits; is
 legend white lady seen one windows. and
 town another church, parish one, round big
 graveyard, full tombstones. mind nicest spot in
 whitby, lies right town, full view the
 harbour bay headland called kettleness
 stretches sea. descends steeply harbour that
 part bank fallen away, graves been
 destroyed. one place part stonework graves stretches
 sandy pathway far below. walks, seats beside
 them, churchyard; people go sit day long
 looking beautiful view enjoying breeze. shall come and
 sit often work. indeed, writing now, my
 book knee, listening talk three old men are
 sitting beside me. seem nothing day sit and
 talk.
 
harbour lies me, with, far side, one long granite wall
 stretching sea, curve outwards end it, in
 middle lighthouse. heavy sea-wall runs along outside
 it. near side, sea-wall makes elbow crooked inversely,
 end lighthouse. two piers a
 narrow opening harbour, suddenly widens.
 
nice high water; tide shoals away to
 nothing, merely stream esk, running between
 banks sand, rocks there. outside harbour this
 side rises half mile great reef, sharp edge of
 runs straight behind south lighthouse. end of
 buoy bell, swings bad weather, sends a
 mournful sound wind. legend ship is
 lost bells heard sea. must ask old man this; he
 coming way....

 gave double share instead. got subject legends,
 went sort sermon. must try remember it

“oh, mr. swales, can’t serious. surely tombstones not

“yabblins! may poorish wrong, savin’ make

 read:--
 
“edward spencelagh, master mariner, murdered pirates coast of

“well, else tombstones for? answer that, miss!”

_5 june._--the case renfield grows interesting get to
 understand man. certain qualities largely developed;
 selfishness, secrecy, purpose. wish get the

 sometimes imagine abnormally cruel. pets odd

 number latter becoming sensibly diminished, although he
 used half food attracting flies outside his

_1 july._--his spiders now becoming great nuisance his
 flies, to-day told must get rid them. looked
 sad this, said must clear them, all
 events. cheerfully acquiesced this, gave time
 reduction. disgusted much him, a
 horrid blow-fly, bloated carrion food, buzzed room,
 caught it, held exultantly moments finger
 thumb, and, knew going do, put his
 mouth ate it. scolded it, argued quietly it
 good wholesome; life, strong life, and
 gave life him. gave idea, rudiment one. must
 watch gets rid spiders. evidently deep problem

 jotting something. whole pages filled masses of
 figures, generally single numbers added batches, the
 totals added batches again, though “focussing” some
 account, auditors put it.

“a kitten, nice little, sleek playful kitten, can play with,

 said see it, asked rather a

“oh, yes, like cat! asked kitten lest should

_20 july._--visited renfield early, attendant went his

 gave many flies one spider many spiders one bird, then
 wanted cat eat many birds. later

_whitby_.
 
one greatest suddenest storms record just been
 experienced here, results strange unique. weather had
 somewhat sultry, degree uncommon month of
 august. saturday evening fine ever known, great
 body holiday-makers laid yesterday visits mulgrave woods,
 robin hood’s bay, rig mill, runswick, staithes, various trips in

 afternoon, gossips frequent east cliff
 churchyard, commanding eminence watch wide sweep of
 visible north east, called attention sudden show of
 “mares’-tails” high sky north-west. wind then
 blowing south-west mild degree barometrical
 language ranked “no. 2: light breeze.” coastguard duty once
 made report, one old fisherman, half century has
 kept watch weather signs east cliff, foretold emphatic
 manner coming sudden storm. approach sunset very
 beautiful, grand masses splendidly-coloured clouds, that
 quite assemblage walk along cliff old
 churchyard enjoy beauty. sun dipped black
 mass kettleness, standing boldly athwart western sky, its
 downward way marked myriad clouds every sunset-colour--flame,
 purple, pink, green, violet, tints gold; and
 masses large, seemingly absolute blackness, all
 sorts shapes, well outlined colossal silhouettes. the
 experience lost painters, doubtless the
 sketches “prelude great storm” will grace r. a. r.
 i. walls may next. one captain made mind and
 “cobble” “mule,” term different
 classes boats, remain harbour till storm passed.
 wind fell away entirely evening, midnight there
 dead calm, sultry heat, prevailing intensity which, on
 approach thunder, affects persons sensitive nature. there
 lights sight sea, even coasting steamers,
 usually “hug” shore closely, kept well seaward, but
 fishing-boats sight. sail noticeable foreign

“as idle painted ship upon painted ocean.”
 
shortly ten o’clock stillness air grew quite
 oppressive, silence marked bleating sheep
 inland barking dog town distinctly heard, the
 band pier, lively french air, like discord the
 great harmony nature’s silence. little midnight came a
 strange sound sea, high overhead air began to
 carry strange, faint, hollow booming.
 
without warning tempest broke. rapidity which, the
 time, seemed incredible, even afterwards impossible realize,
 whole aspect nature became convulsed. waves rose in
 growing fury, overtopping fellow, till minutes
 lately glassy like roaring devouring monster.
 white-crested waves beat madly level sands rushed the

 touching living brethren clammy hands death, many
 one shuddered wreaths sea-mist swept by. times mist
 cleared, distance seen glare the
 lightning, now came thick fast, followed sudden peals
 thunder whole sky overhead seemed trembling shock
 footsteps storm.
 
scenes thus revealed immeasurable grandeur of
 absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with
 wave mighty masses white foam, tempest seemed to
 snatch whirl away space; fishing-boat, with
 rag sail, running madly shelter blast; now again
 white wings storm-tossed sea-bird. summit east

 quite impossible fetch entrance the
 harbour. now nearly hour high tide, waves so
 great troughs shallows shore almost

 speed that, words one old salt, “she must fetch somewhere,
 hell.” came another rush sea-fog, greater than
 hitherto--a mass dank mist, seemed close things
 like grey pall, left available men organ hearing,
 roar tempest, crash thunder, the
 booming mighty billows came damp oblivion even louder
 before. rays searchlight kept fixed harbour
 mouth across east pier, shock expected, men waited
 breathless. wind suddenly shifted north-east, remnant
 sea-fog melted blast; then, _mirabile dictu_, between
 piers, leaping wave wave rushed headlong speed,
 swept strange schooner blast, sail set, and
 gained safety harbour. searchlight followed her, a
 shudder ran saw her, lashed helm a
 corpse, drooping head, swung horribly fro each
 motion ship. form seen deck all. great
 awe came realised ship, miracle, had
 found harbour, unsteered save hand dead man! however,
 took place quickly takes write words. the
 schooner paused not, rushing across harbour, pitched on
 accumulation sand gravel washed many tides many
 storms south-east corner pier jutting east
 cliff, known locally tate hill pier.
 
course considerable concussion vessel drove on
 sand heap. every spar, rope, stay strained, the
 “top-hammer” came crashing down. but, strangest all, instant
 shore touched, immense dog sprang deck below, as

 side harbour, ran little pier, the

 entrance harbour without seeing anything, turned the

wonder coastguard surprised, even awed, for
 often can sight seen. man simply fastened

 place--who came immediately me, declared, making
 examination, man must dead quite two days. his
 pocket bottle, carefully corked, empty save little roll of
 paper, proved addendum log. coastguard said
 man must tied hands, fastening knots his

 complications, later on, admiralty court; coastguards cannot
 claim salvage right first civilian entering a

 dead steersman reverently removed place where

 foolish ideas demoralise men; said engage keep
 trouble handspike. let take helm, the
 rest began thorough search, keeping abreast, lanterns: left
 corner unsearched. big wooden boxes, there
 odd corners man hide. men much relieved when
 search over, went back work cheerfully. first mate scowled, but
 said nothing.

 seemingly outside port. see nothing fog. rushed deck, and
 ran mate. tells heard cry ran, sign man on
 watch. one gone. lord, help us! mate says must past straits

 heard man cry out. now north sea, and
 god can guide us fog, seems move us; god
 seems deserted us.

_3 august_.--at midnight went relieve man wheel, and
 got found one there. wind steady, ran
 yawing. dared leave it, shouted the
 mate. seconds rushed deck flannels. he
 looked wild-eyed haggard, greatly fear reason given
 way. came close whispered hoarsely, mouth my
 ear, though fearing air might hear: “_it_ here; know
 it, now. watch last night saw it, like man, tall thin,
 ghastly pale. bows, looking out. crept behind
 it, gave knife; knife went it, empty the
 air.” spoke took knife drove savagely into
 space. went on: “but here, i’ll find it. the
 hold, perhaps one boxes. i’ll unscrew one one and
 see. work helm.” and, warning look finger his
 lip, went below. springing choppy wind, could
 leave helm. saw come deck tool-chest
 lantern, go forward hatchway. mad, stark,
 raving mad, it’s use trying stop him. can’t hurt those
 big boxes: invoiced “clay,” pull as
 harmless thing can do. stay, mind helm, and
 write notes. can trust god wait till fog clears.
 then, can’t steer harbour wind is, shall cut
 sails lie by, signal help....
 
* * * * *
 
nearly now. just beginning hope mate
 come calmer--for heard knocking away something the
 hold, work good him--there came hatchway sudden,
 startled scream, made blood run cold, deck he
 came shot gun--a raging madman, eyes rolling and
 face convulsed fear. “save me! save me!” cried, then
 looked round blanket fog. horror turned despair, in
 steady voice said: “you better come too, captain, is
 late. _he_ there. know secret now. will save me
 him, left!” say word, or
 move forward seize him, sprang bulwark deliberately
 threw sea. suppose know secret too, now. was
 madman got rid men one one, now has
 followed himself. god help me! account these
 horrors get port? _when_ get port! will ever be?
 
* * * * *
 
_4 august._--still fog, sunrise pierce. know is
 sunrise sailor, else know not. dared go
 below, dared leave helm; night stayed, in
 dimness night saw it--him! god forgive me, mate was
 right jump overboard. better die like man; die like a
 sailor blue water man can object. captain, must not
 leave ship. shall baffle fiend monster, shall tie
 hands wheel strength begins fail, along with
 shall tie he--it!--dare touch; then, come good
 wind foul, shall save soul, honour captain. am
 growing weaker, night coming on. can look the

_8 august._--lucy restless night, i, too, not
 sleep. storm fearful, boomed loudly among the
 chimney-pots, made shudder. sharp puff came seemed be
 like distant gun. strangely enough, lucy wake; got up
 twice dressed herself. fortunately, time awoke time and
 managed undress without waking her, got back bed. it
 strange thing, sleep-walking, soon will is
 thwarted physical way, intention, any,
 disappears, yields almost exactly routine her
 life.
 
early morning got went harbour see
 anything happened night. people about,
 though sun bright, air clear fresh, big,
 grim-looking waves, seemed dark foam that
 topped like snow, forced narrow mouth
 harbour--like bullying man going crowd. somehow i
 felt glad jonathan last night, land. but,
 oh, land sea? he, how? getting fearfully
 anxious him. knew do, anything!
 
* * * * *
 
_10 august._--the funeral poor sea-captain to-day most
 touching. every boat harbour seemed there, coffin
 carried captains way tate hill pier the
 churchyard. lucy came me, went early old seat, whilst
 cortège boats went river viaduct came down
 again. lovely view, saw procession nearly way.
 poor fellow laid rest quite near seat stood on
 time came saw everything. poor lucy seemed much upset.
 restless uneasy time, think that
 dreaming night telling her. quite odd one thing:
 will admit cause restlessness; if
 be, understand herself. additional
 cause poor old mr. swales found dead morning our
 seat, neck broken. evidently, doctor said,
 fallen back seat sort fright, look of
 fear horror face men said made shudder. poor
 dear old man! perhaps seen death dying eyes! lucy so
 sweet sensitive feels influences acutely other
 people do. just now quite upset little thing did
 much heed, though fond animals. one men
 came often look boats followed dog.
 dog always him. quiet persons, never saw
 man angry, heard dog bark. service dog would
 come master, seat us, kept few
 yards off, barking howling. master spoke gently, then
 harshly, angrily; neither come cease make a
 noise. sort fury, eyes savage, hairs
 bristling like cat’s tail puss war-path. finally
 man, too, got angry, jumped kicked dog, then
 took scruff neck half dragged half threw on
 tombstone seat fixed. moment touched the
 stone poor thing became quiet fell tremble. did
 try get away, crouched down, quivering cowering, was
 pitiable state terror tried, though without effect,
 comfort it. lucy full pity, too, attempt to
 touch dog, looked agonised sort way. greatly
 fear super-sensitive nature go world
 without trouble. will dreaming to-night, sure. the
 whole agglomeration things--the ship steered port dead
 man; attitude, tied wheel crucifix beads; the
 touching funeral; dog, now furious now terror--will all
 afford material dreams.
 
think will best go bed tired physically, i
 shall take long walk cliffs robin hood’s bay and
 back. much inclination sleep-walking then.

 potency; fell deep sleep. professor was
 satisfied called arthur room, bade strip his
 coat. added: “you may take one little kiss whiles bring
 table. friend john, help me!” neither us looked whilst
 bent her.
 
helsing turning me, said:
 
“he young strong blood pure need not
 defibrinate it.”
 
swiftness, absolute method, helsing performed the
 operation. transfusion went something like life seemed come
 back poor lucy’s cheeks, arthur’s growing pallor joy
 face seemed absolutely shine. bit began grow
 anxious, loss blood telling arthur, strong man he
 was. gave idea terrible strain lucy’s system must
 undergone weakened arthur partially restored her.

“the brave lover, think, deserve another kiss, shall have

“you will? oh, will really? good me. will

 back, asleep.
 
night long watched her. never stirred, slept on
 deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. lips were
 slightly parted, breast rose fell regularity a

“and patient?”
 
“well, left her, rather left me,” answered.
 
“come, let us see,” said. together went room.
 
blind down, went raise gently, whilst van
 helsing stepped, soft, cat-like tread, bed.
 
raised blind, morning sunlight flooded room, i
 heard professor’s low hiss inspiration, knowing rarity, a
 deadly fear shot heart. passed moved back, and
 exclamation horror, “gott himmel!” needed enforcement from
 agonised face. raised hand pointed bed, his
 iron face drawn ashen white. felt knees begin tremble.
 
bed, seemingly swoon, lay poor lucy, horribly
 white wan-looking ever. even lips white, gums
 seemed shrunken back teeth, sometimes see a
 corpse prolonged illness. helsing raised foot stamp
 anger, instinct life long years habit
 stood him, put softly. “quick!” said. “bring
 brandy.” flew dining-room, returned decanter.
 wetted poor white lips it, together rubbed palm and
 wrist heart. felt heart, moments agonising
 suspense said:--
 
“it late. beats, though feebly. work is
 undone; must begin again. young arthur now; have
 call time, friend john.” spoke, was
 dipping bag producing instruments transfusion; i
 taken coat rolled shirt-sleeve. no
 possibility opiate just present, need one; so,
 without moment’s delay, began operation. time--it did
 seem short time either, draining away one’s blood, no
 matter willingly given, terrible feeling--van helsing
 held warning finger. “do stir,” said, “but fear with
 growing strength may wake; make danger, oh, much
 danger. shall precaution take. shall give hypodermic injection
 morphia.” proceeded then, swiftly deftly, carry his
 intent. effect lucy bad, faint seemed merge
 subtly narcotic sleep. feeling personal pride
 see faint tinge colour steal back pallid
 cheeks lips. man knows, till experiences it, to
 feel life-blood drawn away veins woman loves.
 
professor watched critically. “that will do,” said. “already?”
 remonstrated. “you took great deal art.” he
 smiled sad sort smile replied:--
 
“he lover, _fiancé_. work, much work, her
 others; present will suffice.”
 
stopped operation, attended lucy, whilst applied
 digital pressure incision. laid down, whilst waited his
 leisure attend me, felt faint little sick. by-and-by
 bound wound, sent downstairs get glass wine for
 myself. leaving room, came me, half
 whispered:--
 
“mind, nothing must said this. young lover turn up
 unexpected, before, word him. frighten and
 enjealous him, too. must none. so!”
 
came back looked carefully, said:--
 
“you much worse. go room, lie sofa, and
 rest awhile; much breakfast, come me.”
 
followed orders, knew right wise were. i
 done part, now next duty keep strength. i
 felt weak, weakness lost something amazement at
 occurred. fell asleep sofa, however, wondering over
 lucy made retrograde movement, how
 drained much blood sign anywhere to
 show it. think must continued wonder dreams, for,
 sleeping waking, thoughts always came back little
 punctures throat ragged, exhausted appearance their
 edges--tiny though were.
 
lucy slept well day, woke fairly well and
 strong, though nearly much day before. helsing
 seen her, went walk, leaving charge, strict
 injunctions leave moment. hear his
 voice hall, asking way nearest telegraph office.
 
lucy chatted freely, seemed quite unconscious anything
 happened. tried keep amused interested. mother
 came see her, seem notice change whatever, but
 said gratefully:--
 
“we owe much, dr. seward, done, really
 must now take care overwork yourself. looking pale
 yourself. want wife nurse look bit; you
 do!” spoke, lucy turned crimson, though momentarily,
 poor wasted veins stand long unwonted
 drain head. reaction came excessive pallor turned
 imploring eyes me. smiled nodded, laid finger my
 lips; sigh, sank back amid pillows.
 
helsing returned couple hours, presently said me:
 “now go home, eat much drink enough. make strong. i
 stay to-night, shall sit little miss myself. and
 must watch case, must none know. grave
 reasons. no, ask them; think will. fear think
 even not-probable. good-night.”
 
hall two maids came me, asked either of
 might sit miss lucy. implored let them; and
 said dr. helsing’s wish either sit
 up, asked quite piteously intercede “foreign
 gentleman.” much touched kindness. perhaps because
 weak present, perhaps lucy’s account, that
 devotion manifested; seen
 similar instances woman’s kindness. got back time a
 late dinner; went rounds--all well; set whilst waiting
 sleep. coming.
 
* * * * *
 
_11 september._--this afternoon went hillingham. found van
 helsing excellent spirits, lucy much better. shortly had
 arrived, big parcel abroad came professor. opened it
 much impressment--assumed, course--and showed great bundle of
 white flowers.
 
“these you, miss lucy,” said.
 
“for me? oh, dr. helsing!”
 
“yes, dear, play with. medicines.” here
 lucy made wry face. “nay, take decoction or
 nauseous form, need snub charming nose, shall
 point friend arthur woes may endure seeing
 much beauty loves much distort. aha, pretty miss,
 bring nice nose straight again. medicinal, but
 know how. put window, make pretty wreath, and
 hang round neck, sleep well. oh yes! they, like the
 lotus flower, make trouble forgotten. smell like waters
 lethe, fountain youth conquistadores sought
 floridas, find late.”
 
whilst speaking, lucy examining flowers smelling
 them. now threw down, saying, half-laughter, and
 half-disgust:--
 
“oh, professor, believe putting joke me. why,
 flowers common garlic.”
 
surprise, helsing rose said sternness, his
 iron jaw set bushy eyebrows meeting:--
 
“no trifling me! never jest! grim purpose do;
 warn thwart me. take care, sake of
 others own.” seeing poor lucy scared, might
 well be, went gently: “oh, little miss, dear, fear
 me. good; much virtue so
 common flowers. see, place room. make the
 wreath wear. hush! telling others make so
 inquisitive questions. must obey, silence part obedience;
 obedience bring strong well loving arms wait
 you. now sit still awhile. come me, friend john, shall
 help deck room garlic, way haarlem,
 friend vanderpool raise herb glass-houses year.
 telegraph yesterday, here.”
 
went room, taking flowers us. professor’s
 actions certainly odd found pharmacopoeia
 ever heard of. first fastened windows latched them
 securely; next, taking handful flowers, rubbed over
 sashes, though ensure every whiff air might get
 laden garlic smell. wisp rubbed
 jamb door, above, below, side, round
 fireplace way. seemed grotesque me, and
 presently said:--
 
“well, professor, know always reason do, but
 certainly puzzles me. well sceptic here, he
 say working spell keep evil spirit.”
 
“perhaps am!” answered quietly began make wreath which
 lucy wear round neck.
 
waited whilst lucy made toilet night, she
 bed came fixed wreath garlic round her
 neck. last words said were:--
 
“take care disturb it; even room feel close, do
 to-night open window door.”
 
“i promise,” said lucy, “and thank thousand times all
 kindness me! oh, done blessed such
 friends?”
 
left house fly, waiting, helsing said:--
 
“to-night can sleep peace, sleep want--two nights travel,
 much reading day between, much anxiety day follow,
 night sit up, without wink. to-morrow morning early
 call me, come together see pretty miss, much
 strong ‘spell’ work. ho! ho!”
 
seemed confident i, remembering confidence two nights
 baneful result, felt awe vague terror. must
 weakness made hesitate tell friend, but
 felt more, like unshed tears.

“how mean, ma’am?” asked professor.

dr. seward’s diary
 

_18 september._--i drove hillingham arrived early.
 keeping cab gate, went avenue alone. knocked gently
 rang quietly possible, feared disturb lucy her
 mother, hoped bring servant door. while,
 finding response, knocked rang again; still answer. cursed
 laziness servants lie abed an
 hour--for now ten o’clock--and rang knocked again, but
 impatiently, still without response. hitherto blamed only
 servants, now terrible fear began assail me. this
 desolation another link chain doom seemed drawing
 tight around us? indeed house death come, too
 late? knew minutes, even seconds delay, might mean hours of
 danger lucy, one frightful relapses;
 went round house try find chance entry
 anywhere.
 
find means ingress. every window door fastened and
 locked, returned baffled porch. so, heard the
 rapid pit-pat swiftly driven horse’s feet. stopped the
 gate, seconds later met helsing running avenue.
 saw me, gasped out:--
 
“then you, just arrived. she? late? you
 get telegram?”
 
answered quickly coherently got his
 telegram early morning, lost minute coming here,
 make one house hear me. paused and
 raised hat said solemnly:--
 
“then fear late. god’s will done!” usual
 recuperative energy, went on: “come. way open get
 in, must make one. time us now.”
 
went round back house, kitchen
 window. professor took small surgical saw case, and
 handing me, pointed iron bars guarded window. i
 attacked soon cut three them. then
 long, thin knife pushed back fastening sashes and
 opened window. helped professor in, followed him. there
 one kitchen servants’ rooms, close at
 hand. tried rooms went along, dining-room,
 dimly lit rays light shutters, found four
 servant-women lying floor. need think dead,
 stertorous breathing acrid smell laudanum the
 room left doubt condition. helsing looked at
 other, moved away said: “we can attend later.”
 ascended lucy’s room. instant two paused the
 door listen, sound hear. white
 faces trembling hands, opened door gently, entered the
 room.
 
shall describe saw? bed lay two women, lucy her
 mother. latter lay farthest in, covered white
 sheet, edge blown back draught the
 broken window, showing drawn, white face, look terror
 fixed upon it. side lay lucy, face white still more
 drawn. flowers round neck found upon her
 mother’s bosom, throat bare, showing two little wounds
 noticed before, looking horribly white mangled.
 without word professor bent bed, head almost touching
 poor lucy’s breast; gave quick turn head, one who
 listens, leaping feet, cried me:--
 
“it yet late! quick! quick! bring brandy!”
 
flew downstairs returned it, taking care smell taste
 it, lest it, too, drugged like decanter sherry found
 table. maids still breathing, restlessly, i
 fancied narcotic wearing off. stay make sure,
 returned helsing. rubbed brandy, another
 occasion, lips gums wrists palms her
 hands. said me:--
 
“i can this, can present. go wake maids.
 flick face wet towel, flick hard. make them
 get heat fire warm bath. poor soul nearly cold as
 beside her. will need heated can anything
 more.”
 
went once, found little difficulty waking three the
 women. fourth young girl, drug evidently
 affected strongly, lifted sofa let her
 sleep. others dazed first, remembrance came back to
 cried sobbed hysterical manner. stern with
 them, however, let talk. told one life
 bad enough lose, delayed sacrifice
 miss lucy. so, sobbing crying, went way, half clad
 were, prepared fire water. fortunately, kitchen and
 boiler fires still alive, lack hot water. we
 got bath carried lucy placed it. whilst
 busy chafing limbs knock hall door. one
 maids ran off, hurried clothes, opened it. then
 returned whispered us gentleman come
 message mr. holmwood. bade simply tell he
 must wait, see one now. went away message,
 and, engrossed work, clean forgot him.
 
never saw experience professor work deadly
 earnest. knew--as knew--that stand-up fight death,
 pause told so. answered way not
 understand, sternest look face wear:--
 
“if all, stop now, let fade
 away peace, see light life horizon.” went
 work with, possible, renewed frenzied vigour.
 
presently began conscious heat beginning to
 effect. lucy’s heart beat trifle audibly the
 stethoscope, lungs perceptible movement. helsing’s
 face almost beamed, lifted bath rolled in
 hot sheet dry said me:--
 
“the first gain ours! check king!”
 
took lucy another room, now prepared, laid
 bed forced drops brandy throat. noticed
 helsing tied soft silk handkerchief round throat. was
 still unconscious, quite bad as, worse than, had
 ever seen her.
 
helsing called one women, told stay her
 take eyes till returned, beckoned me
 room.
 
“we must consult done,” said descended the
 stairs. hall opened dining-room door, passed in, he
 closing door carefully behind him. shutters opened, but
 blinds already down, obedience etiquette of
 death british woman lower classes always rigidly
 observes. room was, therefore, dimly dark. was, however, light
 enough purposes. helsing’s sternness somewhat relieved
 look perplexity. evidently torturing mind about
 something, waited instant, spoke:--
 
“what now? turn help? must have
 another transfusion blood, soon, poor girl’s life
 won’t worth hour’s purchase. exhausted already; am
 exhausted too. fear trust women, even have
 courage submit. one will open his
 veins her?”
 
“what’s matter me, anyhow?”
 
voice came sofa across room, tones brought
 relief joy heart, quincey morris. van
 helsing started angrily first sound, face softened a
 glad look came eyes cried out: “quincey morris!” and
 rushed towards outstretched hands.
 
“what brought here?” cried hands met.
 
“i guess art cause.”
 
handed telegram:--
 
“have heard seward three days, terribly anxious.
 leave. father still condition. send word lucy is.
 delay.--holmwood.”
 
“i think came just nick time. know tell
 do.”
 
helsing strode forward, took hand, looking straight in
 eyes said:--
 
“a brave man’s blood best thing earth woman in
 trouble. you’re man mistake. well, devil may work against
 us he’s worth, god sends us men want them.”
 
went ghastly operation. heart
 go details. lucy got terrible shock it
 told before, though plenty blood went her
 veins, body respond treatment well other
 occasions. struggle back life something frightful see
 hear. however, action heart lungs improved, van
 helsing made subcutaneous injection morphia, before, with
 good effect. faint became profound slumber. professor watched
 whilst went downstairs quincey morris, sent one maids
 pay one cabmen waiting. left quincey lying down
 glass wine, told cook get ready good
 breakfast. thought struck me, went back room where
 lucy now was. came softly in, found helsing sheet or
 two note-paper hand. evidently read it, was
 thinking sat hand brow. look
 grim satisfaction face, one doubt solved.
 handed paper saying only: “it dropped lucy’s breast when
 carried bath.”
 
read it, stood looking professor, pause
 asked him: “in god’s name, mean? she, she,
 mad; sort horrible danger it?” bewildered i
 know say more. helsing put hand took the
 paper, saying:--
 
“do trouble now. forget present. shall know
 understand good time; will later. now what
 came say?” brought back fact, i
 again.
 
“i came speak certificate death. act
 properly wisely, may inquest, paper have
 produced. hopes need inquest, we
 surely kill poor lucy, nothing else did. know, you
 know, doctor attended knows, mrs. westenra
 disease heart, can certify died it. let us
 fill certificate once, shall take the
 registrar go undertaker.”
 
“good, oh friend john! well thought of! truly miss lucy, be
 sad foes beset her, least happy friends that
 love her. one, two, three, open veins her, besides one old
 man. ah yes, know, friend john; blind! love the
 it! now go.”
 
hall met quincey morris, telegram arthur telling him
 mrs. westenra dead; lucy also ill, now
 going better; helsing her. told him
 going, hurried out, going said:--
 
“when come back, jack, may two words to
 ourselves?” nodded reply went out. found difficulty about
 registration, arranged local undertaker come in
 evening measure coffin make arrangements.
 
got back quincey waiting me. told see him
 soon knew lucy, went room. still
 sleeping, professor seemingly moved seat her
 side. putting finger lips, gathered he
 expected wake long afraid forestalling nature.
 went quincey took breakfast-room, where
 blinds drawn down, little cheerful, or
 rather less cheerless, rooms. alone, said
 me:--
 
“jack seward, don’t want shove anywhere i’ve no
 right be; ordinary case. know loved girl
 wanted marry her; but, although that’s past gone, can’t
 help feeling anxious same. that’s wrong
 her? dutchman--and fine old fellow is; can see

 _another_ transfusion blood, exhausted.
 now know well medical men speak _in camera_, man
 must expect know consult private. is
 common matter, and, whatever is, done part. that
 so?”
 
“that’s so,” said, went on:--
 
“i take helsing done already did
 to-day. so?”
 
“that’s so.”
 
“and guess art too. saw four days ago his
 place looked queer. seen anything pulled quick
 since pampas mare fond go grass

 night, gorge vein left open, there
 wasn’t enough blood let stand up, put a
 bullet lay. jack, may tell without
 betraying confidence, arthur first, so?” spoke
 poor fellow looked terribly anxious. torture suspense
 regarding woman loved, utter ignorance terrible
 mystery seemed surround intensified pain. very
 heart bleeding, took manhood him--and a
 royal lot it, too--to keep breaking down. paused before
 answering, felt must betray anything the
 professor wished kept secret; already knew much, guessed
 much, reason answering, answered
 phrase: “that’s so.”
 
“and long going on?”
 
“about ten days.”
 
“ten days! guess, jack seward, poor pretty creature
 love put veins within time blood
 four strong men. man alive, whole body wouldn’t hold it.” then,
 coming close me, spoke fierce half-whisper: “what took it
 out?”
 
shook head. “that,” said, “is crux. helsing simply
 frantic it, wits’ end. can’t even hazard guess.
 series little circumstances thrown out
 calculations lucy properly watched. shall
 occur again. stay well--or ill.” quincey held
 hand. “count in,” said. “you dutchman will tell me
 do, i’ll it.”
 
woke late afternoon, lucy’s first movement feel
 breast, and, surprise, produced paper helsing
 given read. careful professor replaced had
 come from, lest waking alarmed. eye lit van
 helsing too, gladdened. looked around room,
 seeing was, shuddered; gave loud cry, put her
 poor thin hands pale face. understood that
 meant--that realised full mother’s death; tried
 comfort her. doubtless sympathy eased somewhat, but
 low thought spirit, wept silently weakly for
 long time. told either us now remain with
 time, seemed comfort her. towards dusk fell
 doze. odd thing occurred. whilst still asleep she
 took paper breast tore two. helsing stepped
 took pieces her. same, however, went on
 action tearing, though material still her
 hands; finally lifted hands opened though scattering
 fragments. helsing seemed surprised, brows gathered as
 thought, said nothing.

_19 september._--all last night slept fitfully, always afraid
 sleep, something weaker woke it. professor and
 took turns watch, never left moment
 unattended. quincey morris said nothing intention, knew
 night long patrolled round round house.
 
day came, searching light showed ravages poor lucy’s
 strength. hardly able turn head, little
 nourishment take seemed good. times she
 slept, helsing noticed difference her, between
 sleeping waking. whilst asleep looked stronger, although more
 haggard, breathing softer; open mouth showed pale
 gums drawn back teeth, thus looked positively longer and
 sharper usual; woke softness eyes evidently
 changed expression, looked self, although dying
 one. afternoon asked arthur, telegraphed him.
 quincey went meet station.
 
arrived nearly six o’clock, sun setting full
 warm, red light streamed window gave more
 colour pale cheeks. saw her, arthur simply choking
 emotion, none us speak. hours passed,
 fits sleep, comatose condition passed it, had
 grown frequent, pauses conversation possible
 shortened. arthur’s presence, however, seemed act a
 stimulant; rallied little, spoke brightly she
 done since arrived. pulled together, spoke as
 cheerily could, best made everything.
 
now nearly one o’clock, helsing sitting with
 her. relieve quarter hour, entering
 lucy’s phonograph. six o’clock try rest. i
 fear to-morrow will end watching, shock too
 great; poor child rally. god help us all.

 odorous flowers. lucy breathing somewhat stertorously, and

 said, “my dear old fellow, summon fortitude: will best

came lucy’s room see helsing had, with
 usual forethought, putting matters straight making
 everything look pleasing possible. even brushed lucy’s
 hair, lay pillow usual sunny ripples. we
 came room opened eyes, seeing him, whispered
 softly:--
 
“arthur! oh, love, glad come!” stooping to
 kiss her, helsing motioned back. “no,” whispered, “not

arthur took hand knelt beside her, looked best,
 soft lines matching angelic beauty eyes. then
 gradually eyes closed, sank sleep. little bit her
 breast heaved softly, breath came went like tired child’s.
 
insensibly came strange change noticed in
 night. breathing grew stertorous, mouth opened, pale
 gums, drawn back, made teeth look longer sharper ever. a
 sort sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way opened eyes, which
 now dull hard once, said soft, voluptuous voice,
 never heard lips:--
 
“arthur! oh, love, glad come! kiss me!” arthur bent
 eagerly kiss her; instant helsing, who, like me,
 startled voice, swooped upon him, catching by
 neck hands, dragged back fury strength which
 never thought possessed, actually hurled almost
 across room.
 
“not life!” said; “not living soul hers!” and
 stood like lion bay.
 
arthur taken aback moment know do

kept eyes fixed lucy, helsing, saw spasm as
 rage flit like shadow face; sharp teeth champed
 together. eyes closed, breathed heavily.
 
shortly opened eyes softness, and
 putting poor, pale, thin hand, took helsing’s great brown
 one; drawing her, kissed it. “my true friend,” said, a
 faint voice, untellable pathos, “my true friend, his! oh,
 guard him, give peace!”
 
“i swear it!” said solemnly, kneeling beside holding his
 hand, one registers oath. turned arthur, said
 him: “come, child, take hand yours, kiss the
 forehead, once.”
 
eyes met instead lips; parted.
 
lucy’s eyes closed; helsing, watching closely, took
 arthur’s arm, drew away.
 
lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, it
 ceased.
 
“it over,” said helsing. “she dead!”
 
took arthur arm, led away drawing-room, he
 sat down, covered face hands, sobbing way that
 nearly broke see.
 
went back room, found helsing looking poor lucy, and

 death given back part beauty, brow cheeks had
 recovered flowing lines; even lips lost their
 deadly pallor. blood, longer needed working
 heart, gone make harshness death little rude as
 might be.

“ah, well, poor girl, peace last. end!”

 foreigner, might quite aware english legal requirements, and
 might ignorance make unnecessary trouble. answered me:--
 
“i know; know. forget lawyer well doctor. but
 altogether law. knew that, avoided the
 coroner. avoid. may papers more--such
 this.”
 
spoke took pocket-book memorandum been
 lucy’s breast, torn sleep.
 
“when find anything solicitor late mrs.
 westenra, seal papers, write to-night. me, watch
 room miss lucy’s old room night, myself
 search may be. well thoughts go into
 hands strangers.”
 
went part work, another half hour found
 name address mrs. westenra’s solicitor written to
 him. poor lady’s papers order; explicit directions
 regarding place burial given. hardly sealed the
 letter, when, surprise, helsing walked room,
 saying:--
 
“can help you, friend john? free, may, service to
 you.”
 
“have got looked for?” asked, replied:--
 
“i look specific thing. hoped find, find i
 have, was--only letters memoranda, a
 diary new begun. here, shall present say
 nothing them. shall see poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
 sanction, shall use some.”
 
finished work hand, said me:--
 
“and now, friend john, think may bed. want sleep, you
 i, rest recuperate. to-morrow shall much do, but
 to-night need us. alas!”
 
turning went look poor lucy. undertaker had
 certainly done work well, room turned small
 _chapelle ardente_. wilderness beautiful white flowers,
 death made little repulsive might be. end the
 winding-sheet laid face; professor bent and
 turned gently back, started beauty us, tall
 wax candles showing sufficient light note well. lucy’s
 loveliness come back death, hours passed,
 instead leaving traces “decay’s effacing fingers,” but
 restored beauty life, till positively believe eyes
 looking corpse.
 
professor looked sternly grave. loved had, and
 need tears eyes. said me: “remain till i
 return,” left room. came back handful wild garlic
 box waiting hall, opened, and
 placed flowers amongst others around bed. he
 took neck, inside collar, little gold crucifix, and
 placed mouth. restored sheet place, we
 came away.
 
undressing room, when, premonitory tap the
 door, entered, began speak:--
 
“to-morrow want bring me, night, set post-mortem
 knives.”
 
“must make autopsy?” asked.
 
“yes no. want operate, think. let tell you
 now, word another. want cut head take out
 heart. ah! surgeon, shocked! you, seen with
 tremble hand heart, operations life death make
 rest shudder. oh, must forget, dear friend john, that

 arthur must not; will free father’s funeral to-morrow,
 will want see her--to see _it_. then, coffined
 ready next day, shall come sleep. shall
 unscrew coffin-lid, shall operation: replace
 all, none know, save alone.”
 
“but all? girl dead. mutilate poor body
 without need? necessity post-mortem nothing
 gain it--no good her, us, science, human
 knowledge--why it? without monstrous.”
 
answer put hand shoulder, said, infinite
 tenderness:--
 
“friend john, pity poor bleeding heart; love more
 bleed. could, take burden

 shall know, bless knowing, though pleasant
 things. john, child, friend now many years, yet
 ever know without good cause? may err--i but

 horrified, let arthur kiss love--though was

“well, good reason now want do. many
 years trust me; believe weeks past, things so
 strange might well doubt. believe yet little, friend
 john. trust not, must tell think; is
 perhaps well. work--as work shall, matter trust no
 trust--without friend trust me, work heavy heart feel,
 oh! lonely want help courage may be!” paused a
 moment went solemnly: “friend john, strange and
 terrible days us. let us two, one, work to
 good end. will faith me?”
 
took hand, promised him. held door open went away,
 watched go room close door. stood without
 moving, saw one maids pass silently along passage--she had
 back towards me, see me--and go room lucy
 lay. sight touched me. devotion rare, grateful
 show unasked love. poor girl
 putting aside terrors naturally death go watch
 alone bier mistress loved, poor clay
 might lonely till laid eternal rest....

must slept long soundly, broad daylight van
 helsing waked coming room. came bedside and
 said:--
 
“you need trouble knives; shall it.”
 
“why not?” asked. solemnity night greatly
 impressed me.
 
“because,” said sternly, “it late--or early. see!” he
 held little golden crucifix. “this stolen night.”
 
“how, stolen,” asked wonder, “since now?”
 
“because get back worthless wretch stole it, the
 woman robbed dead living. punishment will surely
 come, me; knew altogether thus
 unknowing, stole. now must wait.”
 
went away word, leaving new mystery think of, a
 new puzzle grapple with.
 
forenoon dreary time, noon solicitor came: mr.
 marquand, wholeman, sons, marquand & lidderdale. genial
 appreciative done, took hands all
 cares details. lunch told us mrs. westenra for
 time expected sudden death heart, put affairs
 absolute order; informed us that, exception certain
 entailed property lucy’s father’s now, default direct
 issue, went back distant branch family, whole estate,
 real personal, left absolutely arthur holmwood. had
 told us much went on:--
 
“frankly best prevent testamentary disposition, and
 pointed certain contingencies might leave daughter either
 penniless free act regarding matrimonial
 alliance. indeed, pressed matter far almost came into
 collision, asked us prepared carry out
 wishes. course, alternative accept. were
 right principle, ninety-nine times hundred should
 proved, logic events, accuracy judgment.
 frankly, however, must admit case form of
 disposition rendered impossible carrying her
 wishes. predeceasing daughter latter come
 possession property, and, even survived her
 mother five minutes, property would, case no
 will--and will practical impossibility case--have been
 treated decease intestacy. case lord godalming,
 though dear friend, claim world; the
 inheritors, remote, likely abandon just
 rights, sentimental reasons regarding entire stranger. assure
 you, dear sirs, rejoiced result, perfectly rejoiced.”
 
good fellow, rejoicing one little part--in which
 officially interested--of great tragedy, an
 object-lesson limitations sympathetic understanding.
 
remain long, said look later day and
 see lord godalming. coming, however, certain comfort to
 us, since assured us dread hostile
 criticism acts. arthur expected five o’clock, so
 little time visited death-chamber. in
 truth, now mother daughter lay it. undertaker,
 true craft, made best display goods, and
 mortuary air place lowered spirits at
 once. helsing ordered former arrangement adhered to,
 explaining that, lord godalming coming soon, be
 less harrowing feelings see left _fiancée_
 quite alone. undertaker seemed shocked stupidity and
 exerted restore things condition left them
 night before, arthur came shocks feelings
 avoid saved.
 
poor fellow! looked desperately sad broken; even stalwart
 manhood seemed shrunk somewhat strain his
 much-tried emotions. had, knew, genuinely devotedly
 attached father; lose him, time, a
 bitter blow him. warm ever, helsing he
 sweetly courteous; help seeing some
 constraint him. professor noticed it, too, motioned to
 bring upstairs. so, left door room, i
 felt like quite alone her, took arm and
 led in, saying huskily:--
 
“you loved too, old fellow; told it, was
 friend closer place heart you. don’t know to
 thank done her. can’t think yet....”
 
suddenly broke down, threw arms round shoulders and
 laid head breast, crying:--
 
“oh, jack! jack! shall do! whole life seems gone me
 once, nothing wide world live for.”
 
comforted well could. cases men need much
 expression. grip hand, tightening arm the
 shoulder, sob unison, expressions sympathy dear man’s
 heart. stood still silent till sobs died away, said
 softly him:--
 
“come look her.”
 
together moved bed, lifted lawn face.
 god! beautiful was. every hour seemed enhancing her
 loveliness. frightened amazed somewhat; arthur, he
 fell a-trembling, finally shaken doubt ague. at
 last, long pause, said faint whisper:--
 
“jack, really dead?”
 
assured sadly so, went suggest--for felt
 horrible doubt life moment longer than
 help--that often happened death faces became
 softened even resolved youthful beauty; was
 especially death preceded acute prolonged
 suffering. seemed quite away doubt, and, after
 kneeling beside couch looking lovingly and
 long, turned aside. told must good-bye, the
 coffin prepared; went back took dead hand his
 kissed it, bent kissed forehead. came away,
 fondly looking back shoulder came.
 
left drawing-room, told helsing said
 good-bye; latter went kitchen tell undertaker’s men
 proceed preparations screw coffin. he
 came room told arthur’s question, he
 replied:--
 
“i surprised. just now doubted moment myself!”
 
dined together, see poor art trying make
 best things. helsing silent dinner-time; but
 lit cigars said--
 
“lord----”; arthur interrupted him:--
 
“no, no, that, god’s sake! yet rate. forgive me, sir:
 mean speak offensively; loss so
 recent.”
 
professor answered sweetly:--
 
“i used name doubt. must call you
 ‘mr.,’ grown love you--yes, dear boy, love you--as
 arthur.”
 
arthur held hand, took old man’s warmly.
 
“call will,” said. “i hope may always title of
 friend. let say loss words thank for
 goodness poor dear.” paused moment, went on: “i know
 understood goodness even better do; was
 rude way wanting time acted so--you remember”--the
 professor nodded--“you must forgive me.”
 
answered grave kindness:--
 
“i know hard quite trust then, trust such
 violence needs understand; take not--that you
 cannot--trust now, yet understand. may be
 times shall want trust cannot--and may
 not--and must yet understand. time will come trust
 shall whole complete me, shall understand as
 though sunlight shone through. shall bless from
 first last sake, sake others her
 dear sake swore protect.”
 
“and, indeed, indeed, sir,” said arthur warmly, “i shall ways
 trust you. know believe noble heart, are
 jack’s friend, hers. shall like.”
 
professor cleared throat couple times, though to
 speak, finally said:--
 
“may ask something now?”
 
“certainly.”
 
“you know mrs. westenra left property?”
 
“no, poor dear; never thought it.”
 
“and yours, right deal will. i
 want give permission read miss lucy’s papers and
 letters. believe me, idle curiosity. motive which,
 sure, approved. here. took them

 lucy’s sake?”
 
arthur spoke heartily, like old self:--
 
“dr. helsing, may will. feel saying i

 questions till time comes.”
 
old professor stood said solemnly:--
 
“and right. will pain us all; will be
 pain, will pain last. too--you of

 reach sweet. must brave heart unselfish, our
 duty, will well!”

_22 september._--in train exeter. jonathan sleeping.
 
seems yesterday last entry made, yet much
 then, whitby world me, jonathan away and
 news him; now, married jonathan, jonathan solicitor, a
 partner, rich, master business, mr. hawkins dead buried, and
 jonathan another attack may harm him. day may ask me
 it. goes. rusty shorthand--see what
 unexpected prosperity us--so may well freshen up
 exercise anyhow....
 
service simple solemn. ourselves
 servants there, one two old friends exeter, his
 london agent, gentleman representing sir john paxton, the
 president incorporated law society. jonathan stood hand in
 hand, felt best dearest friend gone us....
 
came back town quietly, taking ’bus hyde park corner.
 jonathan thought interest go row while, so
 sat down; people there, was
 sad-looking desolate see many empty chairs. made us think
 empty chair home; got walked piccadilly.
 jonathan holding arm, way used old days
 went school. felt improper, can’t go on
 years teaching etiquette decorum girls without the
 pedantry biting bit; jonathan, he
 husband, didn’t know anybody saw us--and didn’t
 care did--so walked. looking beautiful
 girl, big cart-wheel hat, sitting victoria outside guiliano’s,
 felt jonathan clutch arm tight hurt me, said
 breath: “my god!” always anxious jonathan, i
 fear nervous fit may upset again; turned him
 quickly, asked disturbed him.
 
pale, eyes seemed bulging as, half terror and
 half amazement, gazed tall, thin man, beaky nose and
 black moustache pointed beard, also observing pretty
 girl. looking hard see either us,
 good view him. face good face; was
 hard, cruel, sensual, big white teeth, looked all
 whiter lips red, pointed like animal’s.
 jonathan kept staring him, till afraid notice. i
 feared might take ill, looked fierce nasty. asked
 jonathan disturbed, answered, evidently thinking that
 knew much did: “do see is?”
 
“no, dear,” said; “i don’t know him; it?” answer seemed to
 shock thrill me, said know was
 me, mina, speaking:--
 
“it man himself!”
 
poor dear evidently terrified something--very greatly
 terrified; believe lean to
 support sunk down. kept staring; man came of
 shop small parcel, gave lady, drove
 off. dark man kept eyes fixed her, carriage
 moved piccadilly followed direction, hailed a
 hansom. jonathan kept looking him, said, himself:--
 
“i believe count, grown young. god, be
 so! oh, god! god! knew! knew!” was
 distressing much feared keep mind the
 subject asking questions, remained silent. drew him
 away quietly, he, holding arm, came easily. walked little
 further, went sat green park. was
 hot day autumn, comfortable seat shady place.
 minutes’ staring nothing, jonathan’s eyes closed, he
 went quietly sleep, head shoulder. thought it
 best thing him, disturb him. twenty
 minutes woke up, said quite cheerfully:--
 
“why, mina, asleep! oh, forgive rude.
 come, we’ll cup tea somewhere.” evidently forgotten
 dark stranger, illness forgotten that
 episode reminded of. don’t like lapsing into
 forgetfulness; may make continue injury brain. must
 ask him, fear shall harm good; must somehow
 learn facts journey abroad. time come, fear, i
 must open parcel, know written. oh, jonathan, will,
 know, forgive wrong, dear sake.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--a sad home-coming every way--the house empty dear
 soul good us; jonathan still pale dizzy slight
 relapse malady; now telegram helsing, whoever he
 may be:--
 
“you will grieved hear mrs. westenra died five days ago, and
 lucy died day yesterday. buried to-day.”
 
oh, wealth sorrow words! poor mrs. westenra! poor
 lucy! gone, gone, never return us! poor, poor arthur, have
 lost sweetness life! god help us bear our
 troubles.

 journey. goes amsterdam to-night, says returns
 to-morrow night; wants make arrangements can
 made personally. stop then, can; says
 work london may take time. poor old
 fellow! fear strain past week broken even his
 iron strength. time burial was, see, putting
 terrible restraint himself. over, were
 standing beside arthur, who, poor fellow, speaking part in
 operation blood transfused lucy’s veins; i
 see helsing’s face grow white purple turns. arthur was
 saying felt since two really married
 wife sight god. none us said word of
 operations, none us ever shall. arthur quincey went
 away together station, helsing came here. the
 moment alone carriage gave way regular fit of
 hysterics. denied since hysterics, insisted
 sense humour asserting very
 terrible conditions. laughed till cried, draw down
 blinds lest one see us misjudge; cried,
 till laughed again; laughed cried together, just woman
 does. tried stern him, one woman the
 circumstances; effect. men women different in
 manifestations nervous strength weakness! face grew
 grave stern asked mirth, time.
 reply way characteristic him, logical and
 forceful mysterious. said:--
 
“ah, don’t comprehend, friend john. think sad,
 though laugh. see, cried even laugh choke me. but
 think sorry cry, laugh come
 just same. keep always laughter knock your
 door say, ‘may come in?’ true laughter. no! a
 king, come like. ask person; choose no
 time suitability. say, ‘i here.’ behold, example grieve my
 heart sweet young girl; give blood her, though
 old worn; give time, skill, sleep; let other
 sufferers want may all. yet can laugh very
 grave--laugh clay spade sexton drop upon her
 coffin say ‘thud! thud!’ heart, till send back blood
 cheek. heart bleed poor boy--that dear boy, of
 age mine boy blessed live, his
 hair eyes same. there, know now love so. yet
 say things touch husband-heart quick, make my
 father-heart yearn man--not even you, friend
 john, level experiences father son--yet even
 moment king laugh come shout bellow ear,
 ‘here am! am!’ till blood come dance back bring of
 sunshine carry cheek. oh, friend john, is
 strange world, sad world, world full miseries, woes, and
 troubles; yet king laugh come make dance the
 tune play. bleeding hearts, dry bones churchyard, and
 tears burn fall--all dance together music he
 make smileless mouth him. believe me, friend john, that
 good come, kind. ah, men women like ropes drawn
 tight strain pull us different ways. tears come; and,
 like rain ropes, brace us up, perhaps strain
 become great, break. king laugh come like the
 sunshine, ease strain again; bear go with
 labour, may be.”
 
like wound pretending see idea; but, i
 yet understand cause laughter, asked him. he
 answered face grew stern, said quite different
 tone:--
 
“oh, grim irony all--this lovely lady garlanded with
 flowers, looked fair life, till one one wondered she
 truly dead; laid fine marble house lonely
 churchyard, rest many kin, laid mother
 loved her, loved; sacred bell going ‘toll!
 toll! toll!’ sad slow; holy men, white
 garments angel, pretending read books, yet time
 eyes never page; us bowed head. all
 what? dead; so! not?”
 
“well, life me, professor,” said, “i can’t see anything to
 laugh that. why, explanation makes harder puzzle
 before. even burial service comic, poor
 art trouble? why, heart simply breaking.”
 
“just so. said transfusion blood veins had
 made truly bride?”
 
“yes, sweet comforting idea him.”
 
“quite so. difficulty, friend john. that, then
 others? ho, ho! sweet maid polyandrist,
 me, poor wife dead me, alive church’s law, though
 wits, gone--even i, faithful husband now-no-wife,
 bigamist.”
 
“i don’t see joke comes either!” said; did
 feel particularly pleased saying things. laid
 hand arm, said:--
 
“friend john, forgive pain. showed feeling others
 wound, you, old friend, can trust.
 looked heart want laugh;
 done laugh arrived; so
 now, king laugh pack crown, him--for
 go far, far away me, long, long time--maybe would
 perhaps pity all.”
 
touched tenderness tone, asked why.
 
“because know!”
 
now scattered; many long day loneliness will
 sit roofs brooding wings. lucy lies tomb her
 kin, lordly death-house lonely churchyard, away teeming
 london; air fresh, sun rises hampstead hill,
 wild flowers grow accord.
 
can finish diary; god knows shall ever begin
 another. do, even open again, will deal with
 different people different themes; end, the
 romance life told, ere go back take thread my
 life-work, say sadly without hope,
 
“finis.”
