_3 may. bistritz._--left munich 8:35 p. m., 1st may, arriving at

 east north. going among latter, claim descended

day long seemed dawdle country full of
 beauty every kind. sometimes saw little towns castles the
 top steep hills see old missals; sometimes ran by
 rivers streams seemed wide stony margin side
 subject great floods. takes lot water, and
 running strong, sweep outside edge river clear. every
 station groups people, sometimes crowds, sorts
 attire. just like peasants home i
 saw coming france germany, short jackets round hats
 home-made trousers; others picturesque. women
 looked pretty, except got near them, clumsy
 waist. full white sleeves kind other,
 big belts lot strips something
 fluttering like dresses ballet, course there
 petticoats them. strangest figures saw the
 slovaks, barbarian rest, big cow-boy
 hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, enormous
 heavy leather belts, nearly foot wide, studded brass
 nails. wore high boots, trousers tucked them, and
 long black hair heavy black moustaches. very
 picturesque, look prepossessing. stage be
 set old oriental band brigands. are,
 however, told, harmless rather wanting natural
 self-assertion.
 
dark side twilight got bistritz, a
 interesting old place. practically frontier--for the
 borgo pass leads bukovina--it stormy
 existence, certainly shows marks it. fifty years ago series
 great fires took place, made terrible havoc five separate
 occasions. beginning seventeenth century underwent
 siege three weeks lost 13,000 people, casualties war

 cheery-looking elderly woman usual peasant dress--white
 undergarment long double apron, front, back, coloured stuff
 fitting almost tight modesty. came close bowed and
 said, “the herr englishman?” “yes,” said, “jonathan harker.” she
 smiled, gave message elderly man white shirt-sleeves,

“your friend,

_4 may._--i found landlord got letter count,
 directing secure best place coach me; on
 making inquiries details seemed somewhat reticent, and
 pretended understand german. be
 true, understood perfectly; least, he
 answered questions exactly did. wife, old
 lady received me, looked frightened sort of
 way. mumbled money sent letter, that
 knew. asked knew count dracula, could
 tell anything castle, wife crossed themselves,
 and, saying knew nothing all, simply refused speak
 further. near time starting time ask
 one else, mysterious means
 comforting.
 
just leaving, old lady came room said a
 hysterical way:
 
“must go? oh! young herr, must go?” excited
 state seemed lost grip german knew, and
 mixed language know all. i
 just able follow asking many questions. told her
 must go once, engaged important business,
 asked again:
 
“do know day is?” answered fourth may.
 shook head said again:
 
“oh, yes! know that! know that, know day is?” on
 saying understand, went on:
 
“it eve st. george’s day. know to-night, when
 clock strikes midnight, evil things world will have
 full sway? know going, going to?”
 evident distress tried comfort her, but
 without effect. finally went knees implored not
 go; least wait day two starting. very
 ridiculous feel comfortable. however, business
 done, allow nothing interfere it. therefore
 tried raise up, said, gravely could, thanked
 her, duty imperative, must go. rose and
 dried eyes, taking crucifix neck offered me. i

_5 may. castle._--the grey morning passed, sun is
 high distant horizon, seems jagged, whether trees or
 hills know not, far big things little are
 mixed. sleepy, and, called till awake,
 naturally write till sleep comes. many odd things put
 down, and, lest reads may fancy dined well i
 left bistritz, let put dinner exactly. dined they
 called “robber steak”--bits bacon, onion, beef, seasoned red
 pepper, strung sticks roasted fire, simple
 style london cat’s meat! wine golden mediasch, which
 produces queer sting tongue, is, however, not
 disagreeable. couple glasses this, nothing else.
 
got coach driver taken seat, saw him
 talking landlady. evidently talking me, every
 now looked me, people sitting
 bench outside door--which call name meaning
 “word-bearer”--came listened, looked me, them
 pityingly. hear lot words often repeated, queer words, for
 many nationalities crowd; quietly got polyglot
 dictionary bag looked out. must say not
 cheering me, amongst “ordog”--satan, “pokol”--hell,
 “stregoica”--witch, “vrolok” “vlkoslak”--both mean same
 thing, one slovak servian something is
 either were-wolf vampire. (_mem._, must ask count these
 superstitions)
 
started, crowd round inn door, time
 swelled considerable size, made sign cross and
 pointed two fingers towards me. difficulty got a
 fellow-passenger tell meant; answer at
 first, learning english, explained a
 charm guard evil eye. pleasant me,
 just starting unknown place meet unknown man; every one
 seemed kind-hearted, sorrowful, sympathetic i
 touched. shall never forget last glimpse i
 inn-yard crowd picturesque figures, crossing
 themselves, stood round wide archway, background of
 rich foliage oleander orange trees green tubs clustered the
 centre yard. driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
 whole front box-seat--“gotza” call them--cracked big
 whip four small horses, ran abreast, set on
 journey.
 
soon lost sight recollection ghostly fears beauty the
 scene drove along, although known language, rather
 languages, fellow-passengers speaking, might have
 able throw easily. us lay green sloping
 land full forests woods, steep hills, crowned
 clumps trees farmhouses, blank gable end the
 road. everywhere bewildering mass fruit blossom--apple,
 plum, pear, cherry; drove see green grass under
 trees spangled fallen petals. amongst these
 green hills call “mittel land” ran road,
 losing swept round grassy curve, shut the
 straggling ends pine woods, ran the
 hillsides like tongues flame. road rugged, still we
 seemed fly feverish haste. understand then
 haste meant, driver evidently bent losing no
 time reaching borgo prund. told road summertime
 excellent, yet put order winter
 snows. respect different general run roads in
 carpathians, old tradition kept
 good order. old hospadars repair them, lest the
 turk think preparing bring foreign troops,
 hasten war always really loading point.
 
beyond green swelling hills mittel land rose mighty slopes
 forest lofty steeps carpathians themselves. right
 left us towered, afternoon sun falling full upon
 bringing glorious colours beautiful range,
 deep blue purple shadows peaks, green brown where
 grass rock mingled, endless perspective jagged rock and
 pointed crags, till lost distance, where
 snowy peaks rose grandly. seemed mighty rifts the
 mountains, which, sun began sink, saw now again
 white gleam falling water. one companions touched arm as
 swept round base hill opened lofty, snow-covered
 peak mountain, seemed, wound serpentine way, to
 right us:--
 
“look! isten szek!”--“god’s seat!”--and crossed reverently.
 
wound endless way, sun sank lower lower behind
 us, shadows evening began creep round us. was
 emphasised fact snowy mountain-top still held the
 sunset, seemed glow delicate cool pink. there
 passed cszeks slovaks, picturesque attire, noticed
 goitre painfully prevalent. roadside many crosses,
 swept by, companions crossed themselves. there
 peasant man woman kneeling shrine, even
 turn round approached, seemed self-surrender of
 devotion neither eyes ears outer world. were
 many things new me: instance, hay-ricks trees, here
 beautiful masses weeping birch, white stems
 shining like silver delicate green leaves. now and
 passed leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant’s cart--with its
 long, snake-like vertebra, calculated suit inequalities the
 road. sure seated quite group home-coming
 peasants, cszeks white, slovaks their
 coloured, sheepskins, latter carrying lance-fashion long
 staves, axe end. evening fell began get cold,
 growing twilight seemed merge one dark mistiness the
 gloom trees, oak, beech, pine, though valleys which
 ran deep spurs hills, ascended the
 pass, dark firs stood background of
 late-lying snow. sometimes, road cut pine woods
 seemed darkness closing upon us, great masses of
 greyness, bestrewed trees, produced a
 peculiarly weird solemn effect, carried thoughts and
 grim fancies engendered earlier evening, falling sunset
 threw strange relief ghost-like clouds amongst the
 carpathians seem wind ceaselessly valleys. sometimes the
 hills steep that, despite driver’s haste, horses could
 go slowly. wished get walk them, home,
 driver hear it. “no, no,” said; “you must not
 walk here; dogs fierce”; added, he
 evidently meant grim pleasantry--for looked round catch the
 approving smile rest--“and may enough matters
 go sleep.” stop make moment’s
 pause light lamps.
 
grew dark seemed excitement amongst the
 passengers, kept speaking him, one other, as
 though urging speed. lashed horses unmercifully
 long whip, wild cries encouragement urged on
 exertions. darkness see sort of
 patch grey light ahead us, though cleft the
 hills. excitement passengers grew greater; crazy coach
 rocked great leather springs, swayed like boat tossed a
 stormy sea. hold on. road grew level, appeared
 fly along. mountains seemed come nearer us each
 side frown upon us; entering borgo pass. one
 one several passengers offered gifts, pressed
 upon earnestness take denial; were
 certainly odd varied kind, given simple good
 faith, kindly word, blessing, strange mixture of
 fear-meaning movements seen outside hotel at
 bistritz--the sign cross guard evil eye.
 then, flew along, driver leaned forward, side the
 passengers, craning edge coach, peered eagerly the
 darkness. evident something exciting either
 happening expected, though asked passenger, one would
 give slightest explanation. state excitement kept for
 little time; last saw us pass opening on
 eastern side. dark, rolling clouds overhead, the
 air heavy, oppressive sense thunder. seemed though the
 mountain range separated two atmospheres, now got
 thunderous one. now looking conveyance
 take count. moment expected see the
 glare lamps blackness; dark. light
 flickering rays lamps, steam our
 hard-driven horses rose white cloud. see now sandy
 road lying white us, sign vehicle.
 passengers drew back sigh gladness, seemed mock
 disappointment. already thinking best do, when
 driver, looking watch, said others something i
 hardly hear, spoken quietly low tone; i
 thought “an hour less time.” turning me, said
 german worse own:--
 
“there carriage here. herr expected all. will
 now come bukovina, return to-morrow next day; better
 next day.” whilst speaking horses began neigh and
 snort plunge wildly, driver hold up. then,
 amongst chorus screams peasants universal crossing
 themselves, calèche, four horses, drove behind us, overtook
 us, drew beside coach. see flash our
 lamps, rays fell them, horses coal-black and
 splendid animals. driven tall man, long brown
 beard great black hat, seemed hide face us. i
 see gleam pair bright eyes, seemed red
 lamplight, turned us. said driver:--
 
“you early to-night, friend.” man stammered reply:--
 
“the english herr hurry,” stranger replied:--
 
“that why, suppose, wished go bukovina. cannot
 deceive me, friend; know much, horses swift.” he
 spoke smiled, lamplight fell hard-looking mouth, with
 red lips sharp-looking teeth, white ivory. one my
 companions whispered another line burger’s “lenore”:--
 
“denn die todten reiten schnell”--
 (“for dead travel fast.”)
 
strange driver evidently heard words, looked a
 gleaming smile. passenger turned face away, time
 putting two fingers crossing himself. “give herr’s
 luggage,” said driver; exceeding alacrity bags were
 handed put calèche. descended side the
 coach, calèche close alongside, driver helping a
 hand caught arm grip steel; strength must been
 prodigious. without word shook reins, horses turned, we
 swept darkness pass. looked back saw steam
 horses coach light lamps, projected
 figures late companions crossing themselves. then
 driver cracked whip called horses, swept
 way bukovina. sank darkness felt a
 strange chill, lonely feeling came me; cloak thrown
 shoulders, rug across knees, driver said in
 excellent german:--
 
“the night chill, mein herr, master count bade take all
 care you. flask slivovitz (the plum brandy the
 country) underneath seat, require it.” take
 any, comfort know same. felt a
 little strangely, little frightened. think been
 alternative taken it, instead prosecuting that
 unknown night journey. carriage went hard pace straight along,
 made complete turn went along another straight road. it
 seemed simply going ground
 again; took note salient point, found was
 so. liked asked driver meant, but
 really feared so, thought that, placed was, any
 protest effect case intention to
 delay. by-and-by, however, curious know time was
 passing, struck match, flame looked watch; was
 within minutes midnight. gave sort shock, i
 suppose general superstition midnight increased my
 recent experiences. waited sick feeling suspense.
 
dog began howl somewhere farmhouse far road--a
 long, agonised wailing, fear. sound taken by
 another dog, another another, till, borne wind which
 now sighed softly pass, wild howling began, seemed
 come country, far imagination grasp
 gloom night. first howl horses began to
 strain rear, driver spoke soothingly, they
 quieted down, shivered sweated though runaway from
 sudden fright. then, far distance, mountains each
 side us began louder sharper howling--that wolves--which
 affected horses way--for minded to
 jump calèche run, whilst reared plunged
 madly, driver use great strength keep them
 bolting. minutes, however, ears got accustomed to
 sound, horses far became quiet driver able
 descend stand them. petted soothed them, and
 whispered something ears, heard horse-tamers
 doing, extraordinary effect, caresses became
 quite manageable again, though still trembled. driver again
 took seat, shaking reins, started great pace. this
 time, going far side pass, suddenly turned a
 narrow roadway ran sharply right.
 
soon hemmed trees, places arched right the
 roadway till passed tunnel; great frowning
 rocks guarded us boldly either side. though shelter, we
 hear rising wind, moaned whistled the
 rocks, branches trees crashed together swept along.
 grew colder colder still, fine, powdery snow began fall,
 soon around us covered white blanket. the
 keen wind still carried howling dogs, though grew
 fainter went way. baying wolves sounded nearer
 nearer, though closing round us every side. i
 grew dreadfully afraid, horses shared fear. driver,
 however, least disturbed; kept turning head to
 left right, see anything darkness.
 
suddenly, away left, saw faint flickering blue flame. the
 driver saw moment; checked horses, and,
 jumping ground, disappeared darkness. know
 do, less howling wolves grew closer; while
 wondered driver suddenly appeared again, without word took
 seat, resumed journey. think must fallen asleep
 kept dreaming incident, seemed repeated
 endlessly, now looking back, like sort awful nightmare.
 flame appeared near road, even darkness
 around us watch driver’s motions. went rapidly where
 blue flame arose--it must faint, seem
 illumine place around all--and gathering stones,
 formed device. appeared strange optical
 effect: stood flame obstruct it,
 see ghostly flicker same. startled me, but
 effect momentary, took eyes deceived me
 straining darkness. time blue
 flames, sped onwards gloom, howling the
 wolves around us, though following moving circle.
 
last came time driver went afield he
 yet gone, absence, horses began tremble worse
 ever snort scream fright. see cause
 it, howling wolves ceased altogether; just
 moon, sailing black clouds, appeared behind the
 jagged crest beetling, pine-clad rock, light saw
 around us ring wolves, white teeth lolling red tongues,
 long, sinewy limbs shaggy hair. hundred times more
 terrible grim silence held even howled.
 myself, felt sort paralysis fear. man
 feels face face horrors can understand
 true import.
 
wolves began howl though moonlight had
 peculiar effect them. horses jumped reared, and
 looked helplessly round eyes rolled way painful see;
 living ring terror encompassed every side; they
 perforce remain within it. called coachman come, for
 seemed chance try break the
 ring aid approach. shouted beat side the
 calèche, hoping noise scare wolves side, as
 give chance reaching trap. came there, know
 not, heard voice raised tone imperious command, and
 looking towards sound, saw stand roadway. swept his
 long arms, though brushing aside impalpable obstacle, wolves
 fell back back still. just heavy cloud passed across
 face moon, darkness.
 
see driver climbing calèche, the
 wolves disappeared. strange uncanny a
 dreadful fear came upon me, afraid speak move. time
 seemed interminable swept way, now almost complete
 darkness, rolling clouds obscured moon. kept on
 ascending, occasional periods quick descent, main
 always ascending. suddenly, became conscious fact the
 driver act pulling horses courtyard a
 vast ruined castle, whose tall black windows came ray light,
 whose broken battlements showed jagged line moonlit
 sky.

_5 may._--i must asleep, certainly fully
 awake must noticed approach remarkable place. in
 gloom courtyard looked considerable size, several dark
 ways led great round arches, perhaps seemed bigger than

calèche stopped, driver jumped held hand

 strength. hand actually seemed like steel vice have
 crushed mine chosen. took traps, placed
 ground beside stood close great door, old and
 studded large iron nails, set projecting doorway of
 massive stone. see even dim light stone was
 massively carved, carving much worn time and
 weather. stood, driver jumped seat shook the
 reins; horses started forward, trap disappeared one

stood silence was, know do. bell
 knocker sign; frowning walls dark
 window openings likely voice penetrate. the
 time waited seemed endless, felt doubts fears crowding upon
 me. sort place come to, among kind people?
 sort grim adventure embarked? a
 customary incident life solicitor’s clerk sent to
 explain purchase london estate foreigner? solicitor’s
 clerk! mina like that. solicitor--for just leaving
 london got word examination successful; now a
 full-blown solicitor! began rub eyes pinch see if
 awake. seemed like horrible nightmare me, i
 expected suddenly awake, find home, with
 dawn struggling windows, now felt
 morning day overwork. flesh answered the
 pinching test, eyes deceived. indeed awake
 among carpathians. now patient, to
 wait coming morning.
 
just come conclusion heard heavy step approaching
 behind great door, saw chinks gleam coming
 light. sound rattling chains clanking of
 massive bolts drawn back. key turned loud grating noise
 long disuse, great door swung back.
 
within, stood tall old man, clean shaven save long white
 moustache, clad black head foot, without single speck
 colour anywhere. held hand antique silver
 lamp, flame burned without chimney globe kind,
 throwing long quivering shadows flickered draught the
 open door. old man motioned right hand courtly
 gesture, saying excellent english, strange intonation:--
 
“welcome house! enter freely will!” made no
 motion stepping meet me, stood like statue, though his
 gesture welcome fixed stone. instant, however, that
 stepped threshold, moved impulsively forward, and
 holding hand grasped mine strength made wince,

 ice--more like hand dead living man. said:--
 
“welcome house. come freely. go safely; leave something the
 happiness bring!” strength handshake much akin to

 moment doubted person was

“count dracula?” bowed courtly way replied:--
 
“i dracula; bid welcome, mr. harker, house. come in;
 night air chill, must need eat rest.” was
 speaking, put lamp bracket wall, stepping out,
 took luggage; carried forestall him. i
 protested insisted:--
 
“nay, sir, guest. late, people not

 traps along passage, great winding stair, and
 along another great passage, whose stone floor steps rang
 heavily. end threw open heavy door, rejoiced
 see within well-lit room table spread supper,
 whose mighty hearth great fire logs, freshly replenished,
 flamed flared.
 
count halted, putting bags, closed door, crossing
 room, opened another door, led small octagonal room lit
 single lamp, seemingly without window sort. passing
 this, opened another door, motioned enter. a
 welcome sight; great bedroom well lighted warmed with
 another log fire,--also added lately, top logs were
 fresh--which sent hollow roar wide chimney. count himself
 left luggage inside withdrew, saying, closed the
 door:--
 
“you will need, journey, refresh making your
 toilet. trust will find wish. ready, come

light warmth count’s courteous welcome seemed have
 dissipated doubts fears. reached normal state,
 discovered half famished hunger; making hasty
 toilet, went room.
 
found supper already laid out. host, stood one side the
 great fireplace, leaning stonework, made graceful wave of
 hand table, said:--
 
“i pray you, seated sup please. will, trust, excuse

handed sealed letter mr. hawkins entrusted me.
 opened read gravely; then, charming smile, handed

 pleasure.
 
“i must regret attack gout, malady constant

time finished supper, host’s desire drawn

 opportunity observing him, found marked
 physiognomy.

 thin nose peculiarly arched nostrils; lofty domed forehead, and
 hair growing scantily round temples profusely elsewhere. his
 eyebrows massive, almost meeting nose, bushy
 hair seemed curl profusion. mouth, far i

 cruel-looking, peculiarly sharp white teeth; protruded over

 horrible feeling nausea came me, which, would, could

 grim sort smile, showed yet done his
 protuberant teeth, sat side the
 fireplace. silent while; looked towards the
 window saw first dim streak coming dawn. seemed a
 strange stillness everything; listened heard from
 valley howling many wolves. count’s eyes
 gleamed, said:--
 
“listen them--the children night. music make!”

 added:--
 
“ah, sir, dwellers city enter feelings the

_7 may._--it early morning, rested enjoyed the
 last twenty-four hours. slept till late day, awoke my
 accord. dressed went room had
 supped, found cold breakfast laid out, coffee kept hot the
 pot placed hearth. card table, which
 written:--
 
“i absent while. wait me.--d.” set and
 enjoyed hearty meal. done, looked bell, i
 might let servants know finished; find one.
 certainly odd deficiencies house, considering the
 extraordinary evidences wealth round me. table service
 gold, beautifully wrought must immense value.
 curtains upholstery chairs sofas hangings of
 bed costliest beautiful fabrics, must have
 fabulous value made, centuries old,
 though excellent order. saw something like hampton court,
 worn frayed moth-eaten. still none of
 rooms mirror. even toilet glass my
 table, get little shaving glass bag i
 either shave brush hair. yet seen servant
 anywhere, heard sound near castle except howling wolves.
 time finished meal--i know whether call it
 breakfast dinner, five six o’clock had
 it--i looked something read, like go about
 castle asked count’s permission. was
 absolutely nothing room, book, newspaper, even writing
 materials; opened another door room found sort of
 library. door opposite mine tried, found locked.
 
library found, great delight, vast number english
 books, whole shelves full them, bound volumes magazines and
 newspapers. table centre littered english magazines
 newspapers, though none recent date. books
 varied kind--history, geography, politics, political
 economy, botany, geology, law--all relating england english life
 customs manners. even books reference the
 london directory, “red” “blue” books, whitaker’s almanac, the
 army navy lists, and--it somehow gladdened heart see it--the
 law list.
 
whilst looking books, door opened, count
 entered. saluted hearty way, hoped good
 night’s rest. went on:--
 
“i glad found way here, sure much that
 will interest you. companions”--and laid hand of
 books--“have good friends me, years past, ever
 since idea going london, given many, many hours
 pleasure. come know great england; to
 know love her. long go crowded streets of
 mighty london, midst whirl rush of
 humanity, share life, change, death, makes

course said willing, asked might

 added:--
 
“you may go anywhere wish castle, except doors are
 locked, course will wish go. reason that
 things are, see eyes know with
 knowledge, perhaps better understand.” said sure of
 this, went on:--
 
“we transylvania; transylvania england. ways are
 ways, shall many strange things. nay, from
 told experiences already, know something of
 strange things may be.”
 
led much conversation; evident wanted to
 talk, talking’s sake, asked many questions regarding
 things already happened come within notice.
 sometimes sheered subject, turned conversation by
 pretending understand; generally answered asked most
 frankly. time went on, got somewhat bolder, asked
 strange things preceding night, as, for
 instance, coachman went places seen blue
 flames. explained commonly believed a
 certain night year--last night, fact, evil spirits
 supposed unchecked sway--a blue flame seen place
 treasure concealed. “that treasure hidden,” he
 went on, “in region came last night, can be
 little doubt; ground fought centuries the
 wallachian, saxon, turk. why, hardly foot soil

 austrian hungarian came hordes, patriots went out

 coming rocks passes, might sweep
 destruction artificial avalanches. invader
 triumphant found little, whatever been
 sheltered friendly soil.”
 
“but how,” said i, “can remained long undiscovered, when
 sure index men will take trouble look?”
 count smiled, lips ran back gums, long,
 sharp, canine teeth showed strangely; answered:--
 
“because peasant heart coward fool! flames only
 appear one night; night man land will, he
 can help it, stir without doors. and, dear sir, even he
 know do. why, even peasant tell who
 marked place flame know look daylight
 even work. even not, dare sworn, able to
 find places again?”
 
“there right,” said. “i know dead even
 look them.” drifted matters.
 
“come,” said last, “tell london house you
 procured me.” apology remissness, went my
 room get papers bag. whilst placing in
 order heard rattling china silver next room, i
 passed through, noticed table cleared lamp
 lit, time deep dark. lamps also lit
 study library, found count lying sofa,
 reading, things world, english bradshaw’s guide. i
 came cleared books papers table; i
 went plans deeds figures sorts. interested in
 everything, asked myriad questions place its
 surroundings. clearly studied beforehand get the
 subject neighbourhood, evidently end knew much
 did. remarked this, answered:--
 
“well, but, friend, needful should? go there

 fall country’s habit putting patronymic first--my friend
 jonathan harker will side correct aid me. will be
 exeter, miles away, probably working papers law my
 friend, peter hawkins. so!”
 
went thoroughly business purchase estate at
 purfleet. told facts got signature the
 necessary papers, written letter ready post to
 mr. hawkins, began ask come across suitable a
 place. read notes made time, i
 inscribe here:--
 
“at purfleet, by-road, came across just place seemed to
 required, displayed dilapidated notice place
 sale. surrounded high wall, ancient structure,
 built heavy stones, repaired large number of
 years. closed gates heavy old oak iron, eaten with
 rust.
 
“the estate called carfax, doubt corruption old _quatre
 face_, house four-sided, agreeing cardinal points of
 compass. contains twenty acres, quite surrounded by
 solid stone wall mentioned. many trees it, which
 make places gloomy, deep, dark-looking pond or
 small lake, evidently fed springs, water clear and
 flows away fair-sized stream. house large all
 periods back, say, mediæval times, one part stone
 immensely thick, windows high heavily barred with
 iron. looks like part keep, close old chapel or

 various points. house added to, straggling

 large house recently added formed private lunatic
 asylum. not, however, visible grounds.”
 
finished, said:--
 
“i glad old big. old family, to

 also chapel old times. transylvanian nobles love
 think bones may lie amongst common dead. seek not

 heart, weary years mourning dead, not
 attuned mirth. moreover, walls castle broken; the
 shadows many, wind breathes cold broken
 battlements casements. love shade shadow, would

 seem accord, else cast face made his
 smile look malignant saturnine.
 
presently, excuse, left me, asking put papers
 together. little time away, began look of
 books around me. one atlas, found opened naturally at
 england, map much used. looking found in
 certain places little rings marked, examining noticed
 one near london east side, manifestly new
 estate situated; two exeter, whitby the
 yorkshire coast.
 
better part hour count returned. “aha!” he
 said; “still books? good! must work always. come; i
 informed supper ready.” took arm, went into
 next room, found excellent supper ready table. the
 count excused himself, dined away from
 home. sat previous night, chatted whilst ate.
 supper smoked, last evening, count stayed with
 me, chatting asking questions every conceivable subject, hour
 hour. felt getting late indeed, not
 say anything, felt obligation meet host’s wishes in
 every way. sleepy, long sleep yesterday fortified
 me; help experiencing chill comes one at
 coming dawn, like, way, turn tide.
 say people near death die generally change to
 dawn turn tide; one tired, and
 tied post, experienced change atmosphere
 can well believe it. heard crow cock coming up
 preternatural shrillness clear morning air; count
 dracula, jumping feet, said:--
 
“why, morning again! remiss let stay so
 long. must make conversation regarding dear new country of
 england less interesting, may forget time flies by
 us,” and, courtly bow, quickly left me.
 
went room drew curtains, little to
 notice; window opened courtyard, see the
 warm grey quickening sky. pulled curtains again, have
 written day.

_midnight._--i long talk count. asked few
 questions transylvania history, warmed subject
 wonderfully. speaking things people, especially of
 battles, spoke present all. he
 afterwards explained saying _boyar_ pride house

 spoke almost plural, like king speaking. wish put

 fascinating. seemed whole history country. he
 grew excited spoke, walked room pulling great
 white moustache grasping anything laid hands as

 shall put nearly can; tells way story of

time close morning, went bed. (_mem._, this
 diary seems horribly like beginning “arabian nights,” for
 everything break cockcrow--or like ghost hamlet’s

_12 may._--let begin facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by
 books figures, can doubt. must not
 confuse experiences will rest own
 observation, memory them. last evening count came from
 room began asking questions legal matters the
 certain kinds business. spent day wearily over
 books, and, simply keep mind occupied, went the
 matters examining lincoln’s inn. certain
 method count’s inquiries, shall try put in
 sequence; knowledge may somehow time useful me.
 
first, asked man england might two solicitors more. i
 told might dozen wished, be
 wise one solicitor engaged one transaction, only
 one act time, change certain militate
 interest. seemed thoroughly understand, went to
 ask practical difficulty one man to
 attend, say, banking, another look shipping, case
 local help needed place far home banking
 solicitor. asked explain fully, might any
 chance mislead him, said:--
 
“i shall illustrate. friend mine, mr. peter hawkins, under
 shadow beautiful cathedral exeter, far from
 london, buys good self place london. good! now
 let say frankly, lest think strange have
 sought services one far london instead one
 resident there, motive local interest might be
 served save wish only; one london residence might, perhaps,
 purpose friend serve, went thus afield to
 seek agent, whose labours interest. now, suppose
 i, much affairs, wish ship goods, say, newcastle, or
 durham, harwich, dover, might more
 ease done consigning one ports?” answered that
 certainly easy, solicitors system of
 agency one other, local work done locally on
 instruction solicitor, client, simply placing
 hands one man, wishes carried by
 without trouble.
 
“but,” said he, “i liberty direct myself. so?”
 
“of course,” replied; “such often done men business, who
 like whole affairs known one person.”
 
“good!” said, went ask means making
 consignments forms gone through, sorts of
 difficulties might arise, forethought guarded
 against. explained things best ability,
 certainly left impression made a
 wonderful solicitor, nothing think or
 foresee. man never country, not
 evidently much way business, knowledge acumen were
 wonderful. satisfied points had
 spoken, verified well books
 available, suddenly stood said:--
 
“have written since first letter friend mr. peter
 hawkins, other?” bitterness heart that
 answered not, yet seen opportunity of
 sending letters anybody.
 
“then write now, young friend,” said, laying heavy hand my
 shoulder: “write friend other; say, will
 please you, shall stay month now.”
 
“do wish stay long?” asked, heart grew cold the
 thought.
 
“i desire much; nay, will take refusal. master,
 employer, will, engaged someone come behalf,
 understood needs consulted. not
 stinted. so?”
 
bow acceptance? mr. hawkins’s interest, not
 mine, think him, myself; besides, count
 dracula speaking, eyes bearing
 made remember prisoner, wished i
 choice. count saw victory bow, his
 mastery trouble face, began use them, but
 smooth, resistless way:--
 
“i pray you, good young friend, will discourse things
 business letters. will doubtless please your
 friends know well, look forward getting
 home them. so?” spoke handed three sheets of
 note-paper three envelopes. thinnest foreign
 post, looking them, him, noticing quiet smile,
 sharp, canine teeth lying red underlip, understood
 well spoken careful wrote, for
 able read it. determined write formal notes
 now, write fully mr. hawkins secret, also mina, for
 write shorthand, puzzle count, he
 see it. written two letters sat quiet, reading a
 book whilst count wrote several notes, referring wrote to
 books table. took two placed his
 own, put writing materials, which, instant door
 closed behind him, leaned looked letters, which
 face table. felt compunction so, for
 circumstances felt protect every way
 could.
 
one letters directed samuel f. billington, no. 7, the
 crescent, whitby, another herr leutner, varna; third to
 coutts & co., london, fourth herren klopstock & billreuth,
 bankers, buda-pesth. second fourth unsealed. just
 look saw door-handle move. sank back my
 seat, just time replace letters and
 resume book count, holding still another letter his
 hand, entered room. took letters table stamped
 carefully, turning me, said:--
 
“i trust will forgive me, much work private this
 evening. will, hope, find things wish.” door he
 turned, moment’s pause said:--
 
“let advise you, dear young friend--nay, let warn all
 seriousness, leave rooms will any
 chance go sleep part castle. old, has
 many memories, bad dreams sleep unwisely. be
 warned! sleep now ever overcome you, like do, then
 haste chamber rooms, rest will be
 safe. careful respect, then”--he finished his
 speech gruesome way, motioned hands were
 washing them. quite understood; doubt whether any
 dream terrible unnatural, horrible net gloom
 mystery seemed closing around me.

written diary fortunately replaced book and
 pen pocket felt sleepy. count’s warning came mind,
 took pleasure disobeying it. sense sleep upon me,
 obstinacy sleep brings outrider. soft
 moonlight soothed, wide expanse without gave sense freedom

 real--so real now sitting broad, full sunlight the
 morning, least believe sleep.
 
alone. room same, unchanged way since i
 came it; see along floor, brilliant moonlight,
 footsteps marked disturbed long accumulation of
 dust. moonlight opposite three young women, ladies by
 dress manner. thought time must dreaming
 saw them, for, though moonlight behind them, threw
 shadow floor. came close me, looked some
 time, whispered together. two dark, high aquiline
 noses, like count, great dark, piercing eyes seemed be
 almost red contrasted pale yellow moon. was
 fair, fair can be, great wavy masses golden hair eyes
 like pale sapphires. seemed somehow know face, know it
 connection dreamy fear, recollect the
 moment where. three brilliant white teeth shone like
 pearls ruby voluptuous lips. something
 made uneasy, longing time some
 deadly fear. felt heart wicked, burning desire would
 kiss red lips. good note down, lest some
 day meet mina’s eyes cause pain; truth.
 whispered together, three laughed--such a
 silvery, musical laugh, hard though sound never have
 come softness human lips. like intolerable,
 tingling sweetness water-glasses played cunning hand.
 fair girl shook head coquettishly, two urged her
 on. one said:--
 
“go on! first, shall follow; right to
 begin.” added:--
 
“he young strong; kisses us all.” lay quiet,
 looking eyelashes agony delightful anticipation.
 fair girl advanced bent till feel movement

 closed eyes languorous ecstasy waited--waited beating
 heart.
 
instant, another sensation swept quick as
 lightning. conscious presence count, his
 lapped storm fury. eyes opened involuntarily i
 saw strong hand grasp slender neck fair woman with
 giant’s power draw back, blue eyes transformed fury, the
 white teeth champing rage, fair cheeks blazing red with
 passion. count! never imagine wrath fury, even to
 demons pit. eyes positively blazing. red light
 lurid, flames hell-fire blazed behind them. his
 face deathly pale, lines hard like drawn wires;
 thick eyebrows met nose now seemed like heaving bar
 white-hot metal. fierce sweep arm, hurled woman
 him, motioned others, though beating
 back; imperious gesture seen used the
 wolves. voice which, though low almost whisper seemed to
 cut air ring round room said:--
 
“how dare touch him, you? dare cast eyes when
 forbidden it? back, tell all! man belongs me! beware
 meddle him, you’ll deal me.” fair girl,
 laugh ribald coquetry, turned answer him:--
 
“you never loved; never love!” women
 joined, mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang the
 room almost made faint hear; seemed like pleasure
 fiends. count turned, looking face attentively,
 said soft whisper:--
 
“yes, can love; can tell past. it
 so? well, now promise done shall
 kiss will. now go! go! must awaken him, work
 done.”
 
“are nothing to-night?” said one them, low laugh,
 pointed bag thrown upon floor, which
 moved though living thing within it. answer he
 nodded head. one women jumped forward opened it. my
 ears deceive gasp low wail, a
 half-smothered child. women closed round, whilst aghast with
 horror; looked disappeared, dreadful
 bag. door near them, passed me
 without noticing. simply seemed fade rays the
 moonlight pass window, see outside the
 dim, shadowy forms moment entirely faded away.
 
horror overcame me, sank unconscious.

_17 june._--this morning, sitting edge bed
 cudgelling brains, heard without cracking whips pounding
 scraping horses’ feet rocky path beyond courtyard.
 joy hurried window, saw drive yard two great
 leiter-wagons, drawn eight sturdy horses, head of
 pair slovak, wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty
 sheepskin, high boots. also long staves hand. i
 ran door, intending descend try join the
 main hall, thought way might opened them. a
 shock: door fastened outside.
 
ran window cried them. looked me
 stupidly pointed, just “hetman” szgany came out,
 seeing pointing window, said something, they
 laughed. henceforth effort mine, piteous cry agonised
 entreaty, make even look me. resolutely turned away.
 leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, handles thick
 rope; evidently empty ease slovaks
 handled them, resonance roughly moved. when
 unloaded packed great heap one corner the
 yard, slovaks given money szgany, spitting on
 luck, lazily went horse’s head. shortly afterwards, i
 heard cracking whips die away distance.
 
* * * * *
 
_24 june, morning._--last night count left early, and
 locked room. soon dared ran the
 winding stair, looked window, opened south. i
 thought watch count, something going on.
 szgany quartered somewhere castle work of
 kind. know it, now hear far-away muffled sound
 mattock spade, and, whatever is, must end some
 ruthless villainy.
 
window somewhat less half hour, saw
 something coming count’s window. drew back watched
 carefully, saw whole man emerge. new shock to
 find suit clothes worn whilst
 travelling here, slung shoulder terrible bag i
 seen women take away. doubt quest,
 garb, too! this, then, new scheme evil: will
 allow others see me, think, may leave
 evidence seen towns villages posting own
 letters, wickedness may shall local
 people attributed me.
 
makes rage think can go on, whilst shut up
 here, veritable prisoner, without protection law which
 even criminal’s right consolation.
 
thought watch count’s return, long time sat
 doggedly window. began notice some
 quaint little specks floating rays moonlight. were
 like tiniest grains dust, whirled round gathered in
 clusters nebulous sort way. watched sense of
 soothing, sort calm stole me. leaned back the
 embrasure comfortable position, enjoy more
 fully aërial gambolling.
 
something made start up, low, piteous howling dogs somewhere far
 valley, hidden sight. louder seemed to
 ring ears, floating motes dust take new shapes to
 sound danced moonlight. felt struggling to
 awake call instincts; nay, soul struggling,
 half-remembered sensibilities striving answer call. i
 becoming hypnotised! quicker quicker danced dust; the
 moonbeams seemed quiver went mass gloom
 beyond. gathered till seemed take dim phantom
 shapes. started, broad awake full possession my
 senses, ran screaming place. phantom shapes, were
 becoming gradually materialised moonbeams, the
 three ghostly women doomed. fled, felt somewhat
 safer room, moonlight lamp
 burning brightly.
 
couple hours passed heard something stirring the
 count’s room, something like sharp wail quickly suppressed; then
 silence, deep, awful silence, chilled me. a
 beating heart, tried door; locked prison, and
 nothing. sat simply cried.
 
sat heard sound courtyard without--the agonised cry a
 woman. rushed window, throwing up, peered between
 bars. there, indeed, woman dishevelled hair, holding her
 hands heart one distressed running. leaning
 corner gateway. saw face window she
 threw forward, shouted voice laden menace:--
 
“monster, give child!”
 
threw knees, raising hands, cried same
 words tones wrung heart. tore hair beat her
 breast, abandoned violences extravagant
 emotion. finally, threw forward, and, though see
 her, hear beating naked hands door.
 
somewhere high overhead, probably tower, heard voice the
 count calling harsh, metallic whisper. call seemed be
 answered far wide howling wolves. many minutes
 passed pack poured, like pent-up dam liberated,
 wide entrance courtyard.
 
cry woman, howling wolves but
 short. long streamed away singly, licking lips.
 
pity her, knew now become child, and
 better dead.
 
shall do? can do? can escape dreadful
 thing night gloom fear?

_25 june, morning._--no man knows till suffered night
 sweet dear heart eye morning can be. the
 sun grew high morning struck top great
 gateway opposite window, high spot touched seemed me

 vaporous garment dissolved warmth. must

 night one post-dated letters went post, first fatal

 come safely back room. must put every detail order. i
 went whilst courage fresh straight window south

 took boots, ventured desperate way. looked down
 once, make sure sudden glimpse awful depth would
 overcome me, kept eyes away it. knew pretty
 well direction distance count’s window, made it
 well could, regard opportunities available. did
 feel dizzy--i suppose excited--and time seemed
 ridiculously short till found standing window-sill and
 trying raise sash. filled agitation, however, when
 bent slid feet foremost window. looked
 around count, but, surprise gladness, made discovery.
 room empty! barely furnished odd things, which
 seemed never used; furniture something same

 minding carefully went, stairs dark, lit
 loopholes heavy masonry. bottom dark,
 tunnel-like passage, came deathly, sickly odour, the
 odour old earth newly turned. went passage smell
 grew closer heavier. last pulled open heavy door stood
 ajar, found old, ruined chapel, evidently
 used graveyard. roof broken, two places were
 steps leading vaults, ground recently dug over, and
 earth placed great wooden boxes, manifestly been
 brought slovaks. nobody about, made search for
 outlet, none. went every inch of
 ground, lose chance. went even the
 vaults, dim light struggled, although dread to
 soul. two went, saw nothing except fragments
 old coffins piles dust; third, however, made a
 discovery.
 
there, one great boxes, fifty all, a
 pile newly dug earth, lay count! either dead asleep, i
 say which--for eyes open stony, without the

* * * * *
 
_29 june._--to-day date last letter, count has
 taken steps prove genuine, saw leave the
 castle window, clothes. went wall,
 lizard fashion, wished gun lethal weapon, might
 destroy him; fear weapon wrought alone man’s hand would
 effect him. dared wait see return, feared
 see weird sisters. came back library, read there
 till fell asleep.
 
awakened count, looked grimly man can
 look said:--
 
“to-morrow, friend, must part. return beautiful
 england, work may end may never
 meet. letter home despatched; to-morrow shall be
 here, shall ready journey. morning come the
 szgany, labours here, also come some
 slovaks. gone, carriage shall come you, shall
 bear borgo pass meet diligence bukovina to
 bistritz. hopes shall see castle
 dracula.” suspected him, determined test sincerity.
 sincerity! seems like profanation word write in
 connection monster, asked point-blank:--
 
“why may go to-night?”
 
“because, dear sir, coachman horses away mission.”
 
“but walk pleasure. want get away once.” smiled,
 soft, smooth, diabolical smile knew trick
 behind smoothness. said:--
 
“and baggage?”
 
“i care it. can send time.”
 
count stood up, said, sweet courtesy made rub my
 eyes, seemed real:--
 
“you english saying close heart, spirit is
 rules _boyars_: ‘welcome coming; speed parting
 guest.’ come me, dear young friend. hour shall wait
 house will, though sad going, that
 suddenly desire it. come!” stately gravity, he, the
 lamp, preceded stairs along hall. suddenly he
 stopped.
 
“hark!”
 
close hand came howling many wolves. almost the
 sound sprang rising hand, just music great
 orchestra seems leap bâton conductor. pause
 moment, proceeded, stately way, door, drew back
 ponderous bolts, unhooked heavy chains, began draw it
 open.
 
intense astonishment saw unlocked. suspiciously, i
 looked round, see key kind.
 
door began open, howling wolves without grew louder
 angrier; red jaws, champing teeth, blunt-clawed
 feet leaped, came opening door. knew that
 struggle moment count useless. such
 allies command, nothing. still door
 continued slowly open, count’s body stood gap.
 suddenly struck might moment means my
 doom; given wolves, instigation. there
 diabolical wickedness idea great enough count, and
 last chance cried out:--
 
“shut door; shall wait till morning!” covered face my
 hands hide tears bitter disappointment. one sweep his
 powerful arm, count threw door shut, great bolts clanged
 echoed hall shot back places.
 
silence returned library, minute two went
 room. last saw count dracula kissing hand
 me; red light triumph eyes, smile that
 judas hell might proud of.
 
room lie down, thought heard a
 whispering door. went softly listened. unless ears
 deceived me, heard voice count:--
 
“back, back, place! time yet come. wait! have
 patience! to-night mine. to-morrow night yours!” low,
 sweet ripple laughter, rage threw open door, saw
 without three terrible women licking lips. appeared they
 joined horrible laugh, ran away.
 
came back room threw knees. near
 end? to-morrow! to-morrow! lord, help me, am
 dear!
 
* * * * *
 
_30 june, morning._--these may last words ever write this
 diary. slept till just dawn, woke threw myself
 knees, determined death came find me
 ready.
 
last felt subtle change air, knew morning
 come. came welcome cock-crow, felt safe.
 glad heart, opened door ran hall. seen
 door unlocked, now escape me. hands
 trembled eagerness, unhooked chains drew back the
 massive bolts.
 
door move. despair seized me. pulled, pulled, at
 door, shook till, massive was, rattled its
 casement. see bolt shot. locked left the
 count.
 
wild desire took obtain key risk, i
 determined scale wall gain count’s
 room. might kill me, death now seemed happier choice of
 evils. without pause rushed east window, scrambled
 wall, before, count’s room. empty, that
 expected. see key anywhere, heap gold
 remained. went door corner winding
 stair along dark passage old chapel. knew now well
 enough find monster sought.
 
great box place, close wall, lid
 laid it, fastened down, nails ready their
 places hammered home. knew must reach body key, so
 raised lid, laid back wall; saw
 something filled soul horror. lay count,
 looking youth half renewed, white hair
 moustache changed dark iron-grey; cheeks fuller,
 white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; mouth redder than
 ever, lips gouts fresh blood, trickled the
 corners mouth ran chin neck. even deep,
 burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, lids pouches
 underneath bloated. seemed whole awful creature were
 simply gorged blood. lay like filthy leech, exhausted his
 repletion. shuddered bent touch him, every sense in
 revolted contact; search, lost. the
 coming night might see body banquet similar way those
 horrid three. felt body, sign find the
 key. stopped looked count. mocking smile
 bloated face seemed drive mad. i
 helping transfer london, where, perhaps, centuries come
 might, amongst teeming millions, satiate lust blood, and
 create new ever-widening circle semi-demons batten the
 helpless. thought drove mad. terrible desire came upon me
 rid world monster. lethal weapon hand,
 seized shovel workmen using fill the
 cases, lifting high, struck, edge downward, the
 hateful face. head turned, eyes fell full
 upon me, blaze basilisk horror. sight seemed to
 paralyse me, shovel turned hand glanced face,
 merely making deep gash forehead. shovel fell my
 hand across box, pulled away flange blade
 caught edge lid fell again, hid horrid
 thing sight. last glimpse bloated face,
 blood-stained fixed grin malice held its
 nethermost hell.
 
thought thought next move, brain seemed
 fire, waited despairing feeling growing me. i
 waited heard distance gipsy song sung merry voices coming
 closer, song rolling heavy wheels the
 cracking whips; szgany slovaks count had
 spoken coming. last look around box which
 contained vile body, ran place gained count’s
 room, determined rush moment door opened.
 strained ears, listened, heard downstairs grinding the
 key great lock falling back heavy door. must
 means entry, one key one of
 locked doors. came sound many feet tramping and
 dying away passage sent clanging echo. turned to
 run towards vault, might find new entrance;
 moment seemed come violent puff wind, the
 door winding stair blew shock set dust from
 lintels flying. ran push open, found was
 hopelessly fast. prisoner, net doom closing
 round closely.
 
write passage sound many tramping feet
 crash weights set heavily, doubtless boxes,
 freight earth. sound hammering; the
 box nailed down. now can hear heavy feet tramping again
 along hall, many idle feet coming behind them.
 
door shut, chains rattle; grinding key
 lock; can hear key withdraw: another door opens and
 shuts; hear creaking lock bolt.
 
hark! courtyard rocky way roll heavy wheels,
 crack whips, chorus szgany pass the
 distance.
 
alone castle awful women. faugh! mina woman,
 nought common. devils pit!
 
shall remain alone them; shall try scale castle wall
 farther yet attempted. shall take gold with
 me, lest want later. may find way dreadful place.
 
away home! away quickest nearest train! away
 cursed spot, cursed land, devil his
 children still walk earthly feet!
 
least god’s mercy better monsters, the
 precipice steep high. foot man may sleep--as man.
 good-bye, all! mina!

_24 july. whitby._--lucy met station, looking sweeter and
 lovelier ever, drove house crescent in
 rooms. lovely place. little river, the
 esk, runs deep valley, broadens comes near the
 harbour. great viaduct runs across, high piers, the
 view seems somehow away really is. valley is
 beautifully green, steep high land
 either side look right across it, unless near enough to
 see down. houses old town--the side away us--are all
 red-roofed, seem piled one anyhow, like the
 pictures see nuremberg. right town ruin whitby
 abbey, sacked danes, scene part of
 “marmion,” girl built wall. noble
 ruin, immense size, full beautiful romantic bits; is
 legend white lady seen one windows. and
 town another church, parish one, round big
 graveyard, full tombstones. mind nicest spot in
 whitby, lies right town, full view the
 harbour bay headland called kettleness
 stretches sea. descends steeply harbour that
 part bank fallen away, graves been
 destroyed. one place part stonework graves stretches
 sandy pathway far below. walks, seats beside
 them, churchyard; people go sit day long
 looking beautiful view enjoying breeze. shall come and
 sit often work. indeed, writing now, my
 book knee, listening talk three old men are
 sitting beside me. seem nothing day sit and
 talk.
 
harbour lies me, with, far side, one long granite wall
 stretching sea, curve outwards end it, in
 middle lighthouse. heavy sea-wall runs along outside
 it. near side, sea-wall makes elbow crooked inversely,
 end lighthouse. two piers a
 narrow opening harbour, suddenly widens.
 
nice high water; tide shoals away to
 nothing, merely stream esk, running between
 banks sand, rocks there. outside harbour this
 side rises half mile great reef, sharp edge of
 runs straight behind south lighthouse. end of
 buoy bell, swings bad weather, sends a
 mournful sound wind. legend ship is
 lost bells heard sea. must ask old man this; he
 coming way....

 gave double share instead. got subject legends,
 went sort sermon. must try remember it

“oh, mr. swales, can’t serious. surely tombstones not

“yabblins! may poorish wrong, savin’ make

 read:--
 
“edward spencelagh, master mariner, murdered pirates coast of

“well, else tombstones for? answer that, miss!”

_5 june._--the case renfield grows interesting get to
 understand man. certain qualities largely developed;
 selfishness, secrecy, purpose. wish get the

 sometimes imagine abnormally cruel. pets odd

 number latter becoming sensibly diminished, although he
 used half food attracting flies outside his

_1 july._--his spiders now becoming great nuisance his
 flies, to-day told must get rid them. looked
 sad this, said must clear them, all
 events. cheerfully acquiesced this, gave time
 reduction. disgusted much him, a
 horrid blow-fly, bloated carrion food, buzzed room,
 caught it, held exultantly moments finger
 thumb, and, knew going do, put his
 mouth ate it. scolded it, argued quietly it
 good wholesome; life, strong life, and
 gave life him. gave idea, rudiment one. must
 watch gets rid spiders. evidently deep problem

 jotting something. whole pages filled masses of
 figures, generally single numbers added batches, the
 totals added batches again, though “focussing” some
 account, auditors put it.

“a kitten, nice little, sleek playful kitten, can play with,

 said see it, asked rather a

“oh, yes, like cat! asked kitten lest should

_20 july._--visited renfield early, attendant went his

 gave many flies one spider many spiders one bird, then
 wanted cat eat many birds. later

_whitby_.
 
one greatest suddenest storms record just been
 experienced here, results strange unique. weather had
 somewhat sultry, degree uncommon month of
 august. saturday evening fine ever known, great
 body holiday-makers laid yesterday visits mulgrave woods,
 robin hood’s bay, rig mill, runswick, staithes, various trips in

 afternoon, gossips frequent east cliff
 churchyard, commanding eminence watch wide sweep of
 visible north east, called attention sudden show of
 “mares’-tails” high sky north-west. wind then
 blowing south-west mild degree barometrical
 language ranked “no. 2: light breeze.” coastguard duty once
 made report, one old fisherman, half century has
 kept watch weather signs east cliff, foretold emphatic
 manner coming sudden storm. approach sunset very
 beautiful, grand masses splendidly-coloured clouds, that
 quite assemblage walk along cliff old
 churchyard enjoy beauty. sun dipped black
 mass kettleness, standing boldly athwart western sky, its
 downward way marked myriad clouds every sunset-colour--flame,
 purple, pink, green, violet, tints gold; and
 masses large, seemingly absolute blackness, all
 sorts shapes, well outlined colossal silhouettes. the
 experience lost painters, doubtless the
 sketches “prelude great storm” will grace r. a. r.
 i. walls may next. one captain made mind and
 “cobble” “mule,” term different
 classes boats, remain harbour till storm passed.
 wind fell away entirely evening, midnight there
 dead calm, sultry heat, prevailing intensity which, on
 approach thunder, affects persons sensitive nature. there
 lights sight sea, even coasting steamers,
 usually “hug” shore closely, kept well seaward, but
 fishing-boats sight. sail noticeable foreign

“as idle painted ship upon painted ocean.”
 
shortly ten o’clock stillness air grew quite
 oppressive, silence marked bleating sheep
 inland barking dog town distinctly heard, the
 band pier, lively french air, like discord the
 great harmony nature’s silence. little midnight came a
 strange sound sea, high overhead air began to
 carry strange, faint, hollow booming.
 
without warning tempest broke. rapidity which, the
 time, seemed incredible, even afterwards impossible realize,
 whole aspect nature became convulsed. waves rose in
 growing fury, overtopping fellow, till minutes
 lately glassy like roaring devouring monster.
 white-crested waves beat madly level sands rushed the

 touching living brethren clammy hands death, many
 one shuddered wreaths sea-mist swept by. times mist
 cleared, distance seen glare the
 lightning, now came thick fast, followed sudden peals
 thunder whole sky overhead seemed trembling shock
 footsteps storm.
 
scenes thus revealed immeasurable grandeur of
 absorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with
 wave mighty masses white foam, tempest seemed to
 snatch whirl away space; fishing-boat, with
 rag sail, running madly shelter blast; now again
 white wings storm-tossed sea-bird. summit east

 quite impossible fetch entrance the
 harbour. now nearly hour high tide, waves so
 great troughs shallows shore almost

 speed that, words one old salt, “she must fetch somewhere,
 hell.” came another rush sea-fog, greater than
 hitherto--a mass dank mist, seemed close things
 like grey pall, left available men organ hearing,
 roar tempest, crash thunder, the
 booming mighty billows came damp oblivion even louder
 before. rays searchlight kept fixed harbour
 mouth across east pier, shock expected, men waited
 breathless. wind suddenly shifted north-east, remnant
 sea-fog melted blast; then, _mirabile dictu_, between
 piers, leaping wave wave rushed headlong speed,
 swept strange schooner blast, sail set, and
 gained safety harbour. searchlight followed her, a
 shudder ran saw her, lashed helm a
 corpse, drooping head, swung horribly fro each
 motion ship. form seen deck all. great
 awe came realised ship, miracle, had
 found harbour, unsteered save hand dead man! however,
 took place quickly takes write words. the
 schooner paused not, rushing across harbour, pitched on
 accumulation sand gravel washed many tides many
 storms south-east corner pier jutting east
 cliff, known locally tate hill pier.
 
course considerable concussion vessel drove on
 sand heap. every spar, rope, stay strained, the
 “top-hammer” came crashing down. but, strangest all, instant
 shore touched, immense dog sprang deck below, as

 side harbour, ran little pier, the

 entrance harbour without seeing anything, turned the

wonder coastguard surprised, even awed, for
 often can sight seen. man simply fastened

 place--who came immediately me, declared, making
 examination, man must dead quite two days. his
 pocket bottle, carefully corked, empty save little roll of
 paper, proved addendum log. coastguard said
 man must tied hands, fastening knots his

 complications, later on, admiralty court; coastguards cannot
 claim salvage right first civilian entering a

 dead steersman reverently removed place where

 foolish ideas demoralise men; said engage keep
 trouble handspike. let take helm, the
 rest began thorough search, keeping abreast, lanterns: left
 corner unsearched. big wooden boxes, there
 odd corners man hide. men much relieved when
 search over, went back work cheerfully. first mate scowled, but
 said nothing.

 seemingly outside port. see nothing fog. rushed deck, and
 ran mate. tells heard cry ran, sign man on
 watch. one gone. lord, help us! mate says must past straits

 heard man cry out. now north sea, and
 god can guide us fog, seems move us; god
 seems deserted us.

_3 august_.--at midnight went relieve man wheel, and
 got found one there. wind steady, ran
 yawing. dared leave it, shouted the
 mate. seconds rushed deck flannels. he
 looked wild-eyed haggard, greatly fear reason given
 way. came close whispered hoarsely, mouth my
 ear, though fearing air might hear: “_it_ here; know
 it, now. watch last night saw it, like man, tall thin,
 ghastly pale. bows, looking out. crept behind
 it, gave knife; knife went it, empty the
 air.” spoke took knife drove savagely into
 space. went on: “but here, i’ll find it. the
 hold, perhaps one boxes. i’ll unscrew one one and
 see. work helm.” and, warning look finger his
 lip, went below. springing choppy wind, could
 leave helm. saw come deck tool-chest
 lantern, go forward hatchway. mad, stark,
 raving mad, it’s use trying stop him. can’t hurt those
 big boxes: invoiced “clay,” pull as
 harmless thing can do. stay, mind helm, and
 write notes. can trust god wait till fog clears.
 then, can’t steer harbour wind is, shall cut
 sails lie by, signal help....
 
* * * * *
 
nearly now. just beginning hope mate
 come calmer--for heard knocking away something the
 hold, work good him--there came hatchway sudden,
 startled scream, made blood run cold, deck he
 came shot gun--a raging madman, eyes rolling and
 face convulsed fear. “save me! save me!” cried, then
 looked round blanket fog. horror turned despair, in
 steady voice said: “you better come too, captain, is
 late. _he_ there. know secret now. will save me
 him, left!” say word, or
 move forward seize him, sprang bulwark deliberately
 threw sea. suppose know secret too, now. was
 madman got rid men one one, now has
 followed himself. god help me! account these
 horrors get port? _when_ get port! will ever be?
 
* * * * *
 
_4 august._--still fog, sunrise pierce. know is
 sunrise sailor, else know not. dared go
 below, dared leave helm; night stayed, in
 dimness night saw it--him! god forgive me, mate was
 right jump overboard. better die like man; die like a
 sailor blue water man can object. captain, must not
 leave ship. shall baffle fiend monster, shall tie
 hands wheel strength begins fail, along with
 shall tie he--it!--dare touch; then, come good
 wind foul, shall save soul, honour captain. am
 growing weaker, night coming on. can look the

_8 august._--lucy restless night, i, too, not
 sleep. storm fearful, boomed loudly among the
 chimney-pots, made shudder. sharp puff came seemed be
 like distant gun. strangely enough, lucy wake; got up
 twice dressed herself. fortunately, time awoke time and
 managed undress without waking her, got back bed. it
 strange thing, sleep-walking, soon will is
 thwarted physical way, intention, any,
 disappears, yields almost exactly routine her
 life.
 
early morning got went harbour see
 anything happened night. people about,
 though sun bright, air clear fresh, big,
 grim-looking waves, seemed dark foam that
 topped like snow, forced narrow mouth
 harbour--like bullying man going crowd. somehow i
 felt glad jonathan last night, land. but,
 oh, land sea? he, how? getting fearfully
 anxious him. knew do, anything!
 
* * * * *
 
_10 august._--the funeral poor sea-captain to-day most
 touching. every boat harbour seemed there, coffin
 carried captains way tate hill pier the
 churchyard. lucy came me, went early old seat, whilst
 cortège boats went river viaduct came down
 again. lovely view, saw procession nearly way.
 poor fellow laid rest quite near seat stood on
 time came saw everything. poor lucy seemed much upset.
 restless uneasy time, think that
 dreaming night telling her. quite odd one thing:
 will admit cause restlessness; if
 be, understand herself. additional
 cause poor old mr. swales found dead morning our
 seat, neck broken. evidently, doctor said,
 fallen back seat sort fright, look of
 fear horror face men said made shudder. poor
 dear old man! perhaps seen death dying eyes! lucy so
 sweet sensitive feels influences acutely other
 people do. just now quite upset little thing did
 much heed, though fond animals. one men
 came often look boats followed dog.
 dog always him. quiet persons, never saw
 man angry, heard dog bark. service dog would
 come master, seat us, kept few
 yards off, barking howling. master spoke gently, then
 harshly, angrily; neither come cease make a
 noise. sort fury, eyes savage, hairs
 bristling like cat’s tail puss war-path. finally
 man, too, got angry, jumped kicked dog, then
 took scruff neck half dragged half threw on
 tombstone seat fixed. moment touched the
 stone poor thing became quiet fell tremble. did
 try get away, crouched down, quivering cowering, was
 pitiable state terror tried, though without effect,
 comfort it. lucy full pity, too, attempt to
 touch dog, looked agonised sort way. greatly
 fear super-sensitive nature go world
 without trouble. will dreaming to-night, sure. the
 whole agglomeration things--the ship steered port dead
 man; attitude, tied wheel crucifix beads; the
 touching funeral; dog, now furious now terror--will all
 afford material dreams.
 
think will best go bed tired physically, i
 shall take long walk cliffs robin hood’s bay and
 back. much inclination sleep-walking then.

 potency; fell deep sleep. professor was
 satisfied called arthur room, bade strip his
 coat. added: “you may take one little kiss whiles bring
 table. friend john, help me!” neither us looked whilst
 bent her.
 
helsing turning me, said:
 
“he young strong blood pure need not
 defibrinate it.”
 
swiftness, absolute method, helsing performed the
 operation. transfusion went something like life seemed come
 back poor lucy’s cheeks, arthur’s growing pallor joy
 face seemed absolutely shine. bit began grow
 anxious, loss blood telling arthur, strong man he
 was. gave idea terrible strain lucy’s system must
 undergone weakened arthur partially restored her.

“the brave lover, think, deserve another kiss, shall have

“you will? oh, will really? good me. will

 back, asleep.
 
night long watched her. never stirred, slept on
 deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. lips were
 slightly parted, breast rose fell regularity a

“and patient?”
 
“well, left her, rather left me,” answered.
 
“come, let us see,” said. together went room.
 
blind down, went raise gently, whilst van
 helsing stepped, soft, cat-like tread, bed.
 
raised blind, morning sunlight flooded room, i
 heard professor’s low hiss inspiration, knowing rarity, a
 deadly fear shot heart. passed moved back, and
 exclamation horror, “gott himmel!” needed enforcement from
 agonised face. raised hand pointed bed, his
 iron face drawn ashen white. felt knees begin tremble.
 
bed, seemingly swoon, lay poor lucy, horribly
 white wan-looking ever. even lips white, gums
 seemed shrunken back teeth, sometimes see a
 corpse prolonged illness. helsing raised foot stamp
 anger, instinct life long years habit
 stood him, put softly. “quick!” said. “bring
 brandy.” flew dining-room, returned decanter.
 wetted poor white lips it, together rubbed palm and
 wrist heart. felt heart, moments agonising
 suspense said:--
 
“it late. beats, though feebly. work is
 undone; must begin again. young arthur now; have
 call time, friend john.” spoke, was
 dipping bag producing instruments transfusion; i
 taken coat rolled shirt-sleeve. no
 possibility opiate just present, need one; so,
 without moment’s delay, began operation. time--it did
 seem short time either, draining away one’s blood, no
 matter willingly given, terrible feeling--van helsing
 held warning finger. “do stir,” said, “but fear with
 growing strength may wake; make danger, oh, much
 danger. shall precaution take. shall give hypodermic injection
 morphia.” proceeded then, swiftly deftly, carry his
 intent. effect lucy bad, faint seemed merge
 subtly narcotic sleep. feeling personal pride
 see faint tinge colour steal back pallid
 cheeks lips. man knows, till experiences it, to
 feel life-blood drawn away veins woman loves.
 
professor watched critically. “that will do,” said. “already?”
 remonstrated. “you took great deal art.” he
 smiled sad sort smile replied:--
 
“he lover, _fiancé_. work, much work, her
 others; present will suffice.”
 
stopped operation, attended lucy, whilst applied
 digital pressure incision. laid down, whilst waited his
 leisure attend me, felt faint little sick. by-and-by
 bound wound, sent downstairs get glass wine for
 myself. leaving room, came me, half
 whispered:--
 
“mind, nothing must said this. young lover turn up
 unexpected, before, word him. frighten and
 enjealous him, too. must none. so!”
 
came back looked carefully, said:--
 
“you much worse. go room, lie sofa, and
 rest awhile; much breakfast, come me.”
 
followed orders, knew right wise were. i
 done part, now next duty keep strength. i
 felt weak, weakness lost something amazement at
 occurred. fell asleep sofa, however, wondering over
 lucy made retrograde movement, how
 drained much blood sign anywhere to
 show it. think must continued wonder dreams, for,
 sleeping waking, thoughts always came back little
 punctures throat ragged, exhausted appearance their
 edges--tiny though were.
 
lucy slept well day, woke fairly well and
 strong, though nearly much day before. helsing
 seen her, went walk, leaving charge, strict
 injunctions leave moment. hear his
 voice hall, asking way nearest telegraph office.
 
lucy chatted freely, seemed quite unconscious anything
 happened. tried keep amused interested. mother
 came see her, seem notice change whatever, but
 said gratefully:--
 
“we owe much, dr. seward, done, really
 must now take care overwork yourself. looking pale
 yourself. want wife nurse look bit; you
 do!” spoke, lucy turned crimson, though momentarily,
 poor wasted veins stand long unwonted
 drain head. reaction came excessive pallor turned
 imploring eyes me. smiled nodded, laid finger my
 lips; sigh, sank back amid pillows.
 
helsing returned couple hours, presently said me:
 “now go home, eat much drink enough. make strong. i
 stay to-night, shall sit little miss myself. and
 must watch case, must none know. grave
 reasons. no, ask them; think will. fear think
 even not-probable. good-night.”
 
hall two maids came me, asked either of
 might sit miss lucy. implored let them; and
 said dr. helsing’s wish either sit
 up, asked quite piteously intercede “foreign
 gentleman.” much touched kindness. perhaps because
 weak present, perhaps lucy’s account, that
 devotion manifested; seen
 similar instances woman’s kindness. got back time a
 late dinner; went rounds--all well; set whilst waiting
 sleep. coming.
 
* * * * *
 
_11 september._--this afternoon went hillingham. found van
 helsing excellent spirits, lucy much better. shortly had
 arrived, big parcel abroad came professor. opened it
 much impressment--assumed, course--and showed great bundle of
 white flowers.
 
“these you, miss lucy,” said.
 
“for me? oh, dr. helsing!”
 
“yes, dear, play with. medicines.” here
 lucy made wry face. “nay, take decoction or
 nauseous form, need snub charming nose, shall
 point friend arthur woes may endure seeing
 much beauty loves much distort. aha, pretty miss,
 bring nice nose straight again. medicinal, but
 know how. put window, make pretty wreath, and
 hang round neck, sleep well. oh yes! they, like the
 lotus flower, make trouble forgotten. smell like waters
 lethe, fountain youth conquistadores sought
 floridas, find late.”
 
whilst speaking, lucy examining flowers smelling
 them. now threw down, saying, half-laughter, and
 half-disgust:--
 
“oh, professor, believe putting joke me. why,
 flowers common garlic.”
 
surprise, helsing rose said sternness, his
 iron jaw set bushy eyebrows meeting:--
 
“no trifling me! never jest! grim purpose do;
 warn thwart me. take care, sake of
 others own.” seeing poor lucy scared, might
 well be, went gently: “oh, little miss, dear, fear
 me. good; much virtue so
 common flowers. see, place room. make the
 wreath wear. hush! telling others make so
 inquisitive questions. must obey, silence part obedience;
 obedience bring strong well loving arms wait
 you. now sit still awhile. come me, friend john, shall
 help deck room garlic, way haarlem,
 friend vanderpool raise herb glass-houses year.
 telegraph yesterday, here.”
 
went room, taking flowers us. professor’s
 actions certainly odd found pharmacopoeia
 ever heard of. first fastened windows latched them
 securely; next, taking handful flowers, rubbed over
 sashes, though ensure every whiff air might get
 laden garlic smell. wisp rubbed
 jamb door, above, below, side, round
 fireplace way. seemed grotesque me, and
 presently said:--
 
“well, professor, know always reason do, but
 certainly puzzles me. well sceptic here, he
 say working spell keep evil spirit.”
 
“perhaps am!” answered quietly began make wreath which
 lucy wear round neck.
 
waited whilst lucy made toilet night, she
 bed came fixed wreath garlic round her
 neck. last words said were:--
 
“take care disturb it; even room feel close, do
 to-night open window door.”
 
“i promise,” said lucy, “and thank thousand times all
 kindness me! oh, done blessed such
 friends?”
 
left house fly, waiting, helsing said:--
 
“to-night can sleep peace, sleep want--two nights travel,
 much reading day between, much anxiety day follow,
 night sit up, without wink. to-morrow morning early
 call me, come together see pretty miss, much
 strong ‘spell’ work. ho! ho!”
 
seemed confident i, remembering confidence two nights
 baneful result, felt awe vague terror. must
 weakness made hesitate tell friend, but
 felt more, like unshed tears.

“how mean, ma’am?” asked professor.

dr. seward’s diary
 

_18 september._--i drove hillingham arrived early.
 keeping cab gate, went avenue alone. knocked gently
 rang quietly possible, feared disturb lucy her
 mother, hoped bring servant door. while,
 finding response, knocked rang again; still answer. cursed
 laziness servants lie abed an
 hour--for now ten o’clock--and rang knocked again, but
 impatiently, still without response. hitherto blamed only
 servants, now terrible fear began assail me. this
 desolation another link chain doom seemed drawing
 tight around us? indeed house death come, too
 late? knew minutes, even seconds delay, might mean hours of
 danger lucy, one frightful relapses;
 went round house try find chance entry
 anywhere.
 
find means ingress. every window door fastened and
 locked, returned baffled porch. so, heard the
 rapid pit-pat swiftly driven horse’s feet. stopped the
 gate, seconds later met helsing running avenue.
 saw me, gasped out:--
 
“then you, just arrived. she? late? you
 get telegram?”
 
answered quickly coherently got his
 telegram early morning, lost minute coming here,
 make one house hear me. paused and
 raised hat said solemnly:--
 
“then fear late. god’s will done!” usual
 recuperative energy, went on: “come. way open get
 in, must make one. time us now.”
 
went round back house, kitchen
 window. professor took small surgical saw case, and
 handing me, pointed iron bars guarded window. i
 attacked soon cut three them. then
 long, thin knife pushed back fastening sashes and
 opened window. helped professor in, followed him. there
 one kitchen servants’ rooms, close at
 hand. tried rooms went along, dining-room,
 dimly lit rays light shutters, found four
 servant-women lying floor. need think dead,
 stertorous breathing acrid smell laudanum the
 room left doubt condition. helsing looked at
 other, moved away said: “we can attend later.”
 ascended lucy’s room. instant two paused the
 door listen, sound hear. white
 faces trembling hands, opened door gently, entered the
 room.
 
shall describe saw? bed lay two women, lucy her
 mother. latter lay farthest in, covered white
 sheet, edge blown back draught the
 broken window, showing drawn, white face, look terror
 fixed upon it. side lay lucy, face white still more
 drawn. flowers round neck found upon her
 mother’s bosom, throat bare, showing two little wounds
 noticed before, looking horribly white mangled.
 without word professor bent bed, head almost touching
 poor lucy’s breast; gave quick turn head, one who
 listens, leaping feet, cried me:--
 
“it yet late! quick! quick! bring brandy!”
 
flew downstairs returned it, taking care smell taste
 it, lest it, too, drugged like decanter sherry found
 table. maids still breathing, restlessly, i
 fancied narcotic wearing off. stay make sure,
 returned helsing. rubbed brandy, another
 occasion, lips gums wrists palms her
 hands. said me:--
 
“i can this, can present. go wake maids.
 flick face wet towel, flick hard. make them
 get heat fire warm bath. poor soul nearly cold as
 beside her. will need heated can anything
 more.”
 
went once, found little difficulty waking three the
 women. fourth young girl, drug evidently
 affected strongly, lifted sofa let her
 sleep. others dazed first, remembrance came back to
 cried sobbed hysterical manner. stern with
 them, however, let talk. told one life
 bad enough lose, delayed sacrifice
 miss lucy. so, sobbing crying, went way, half clad
 were, prepared fire water. fortunately, kitchen and
 boiler fires still alive, lack hot water. we
 got bath carried lucy placed it. whilst
 busy chafing limbs knock hall door. one
 maids ran off, hurried clothes, opened it. then
 returned whispered us gentleman come
 message mr. holmwood. bade simply tell he
 must wait, see one now. went away message,
 and, engrossed work, clean forgot him.
 
never saw experience professor work deadly
 earnest. knew--as knew--that stand-up fight death,
 pause told so. answered way not
 understand, sternest look face wear:--
 
“if all, stop now, let fade
 away peace, see light life horizon.” went
 work with, possible, renewed frenzied vigour.
 
presently began conscious heat beginning to
 effect. lucy’s heart beat trifle audibly the
 stethoscope, lungs perceptible movement. helsing’s
 face almost beamed, lifted bath rolled in
 hot sheet dry said me:--
 
“the first gain ours! check king!”
 
took lucy another room, now prepared, laid
 bed forced drops brandy throat. noticed
 helsing tied soft silk handkerchief round throat. was
 still unconscious, quite bad as, worse than, had
 ever seen her.
 
helsing called one women, told stay her
 take eyes till returned, beckoned me
 room.
 
“we must consult done,” said descended the
 stairs. hall opened dining-room door, passed in, he
 closing door carefully behind him. shutters opened, but
 blinds already down, obedience etiquette of
 death british woman lower classes always rigidly
 observes. room was, therefore, dimly dark. was, however, light
 enough purposes. helsing’s sternness somewhat relieved
 look perplexity. evidently torturing mind about
 something, waited instant, spoke:--
 
“what now? turn help? must have
 another transfusion blood, soon, poor girl’s life
 won’t worth hour’s purchase. exhausted already; am
 exhausted too. fear trust women, even have
 courage submit. one will open his
 veins her?”
 
“what’s matter me, anyhow?”
 
voice came sofa across room, tones brought
 relief joy heart, quincey morris. van
 helsing started angrily first sound, face softened a
 glad look came eyes cried out: “quincey morris!” and
 rushed towards outstretched hands.
 
“what brought here?” cried hands met.
 
“i guess art cause.”
 
handed telegram:--
 
“have heard seward three days, terribly anxious.
 leave. father still condition. send word lucy is.
 delay.--holmwood.”
 
“i think came just nick time. know tell
 do.”
 
helsing strode forward, took hand, looking straight in
 eyes said:--
 
“a brave man’s blood best thing earth woman in
 trouble. you’re man mistake. well, devil may work against
 us he’s worth, god sends us men want them.”
 
went ghastly operation. heart
 go details. lucy got terrible shock it
 told before, though plenty blood went her
 veins, body respond treatment well other
 occasions. struggle back life something frightful see
 hear. however, action heart lungs improved, van
 helsing made subcutaneous injection morphia, before, with
 good effect. faint became profound slumber. professor watched
 whilst went downstairs quincey morris, sent one maids
 pay one cabmen waiting. left quincey lying down
 glass wine, told cook get ready good
 breakfast. thought struck me, went back room where
 lucy now was. came softly in, found helsing sheet or
 two note-paper hand. evidently read it, was
 thinking sat hand brow. look
 grim satisfaction face, one doubt solved.
 handed paper saying only: “it dropped lucy’s breast when
 carried bath.”
 
read it, stood looking professor, pause
 asked him: “in god’s name, mean? she, she,
 mad; sort horrible danger it?” bewildered i
 know say more. helsing put hand took the
 paper, saying:--
 
“do trouble now. forget present. shall know
 understand good time; will later. now what
 came say?” brought back fact, i
 again.
 
“i came speak certificate death. act
 properly wisely, may inquest, paper have
 produced. hopes need inquest, we
 surely kill poor lucy, nothing else did. know, you
 know, doctor attended knows, mrs. westenra
 disease heart, can certify died it. let us
 fill certificate once, shall take the
 registrar go undertaker.”
 
“good, oh friend john! well thought of! truly miss lucy, be
 sad foes beset her, least happy friends that
 love her. one, two, three, open veins her, besides one old
 man. ah yes, know, friend john; blind! love the
 it! now go.”
 
hall met quincey morris, telegram arthur telling him
 mrs. westenra dead; lucy also ill, now
 going better; helsing her. told him
 going, hurried out, going said:--
 
“when come back, jack, may two words to
 ourselves?” nodded reply went out. found difficulty about
 registration, arranged local undertaker come in
 evening measure coffin make arrangements.
 
got back quincey waiting me. told see him
 soon knew lucy, went room. still
 sleeping, professor seemingly moved seat her
 side. putting finger lips, gathered he
 expected wake long afraid forestalling nature.
 went quincey took breakfast-room, where
 blinds drawn down, little cheerful, or
 rather less cheerless, rooms. alone, said
 me:--
 
“jack seward, don’t want shove anywhere i’ve no
 right be; ordinary case. know loved girl
 wanted marry her; but, although that’s past gone, can’t
 help feeling anxious same. that’s wrong
 her? dutchman--and fine old fellow is; can see

 _another_ transfusion blood, exhausted.
 now know well medical men speak _in camera_, man
 must expect know consult private. is
 common matter, and, whatever is, done part. that
 so?”
 
“that’s so,” said, went on:--
 
“i take helsing done already did
 to-day. so?”
 
“that’s so.”
 
“and guess art too. saw four days ago his
 place looked queer. seen anything pulled quick
 since pampas mare fond go grass

 night, gorge vein left open, there
 wasn’t enough blood let stand up, put a
 bullet lay. jack, may tell without
 betraying confidence, arthur first, so?” spoke
 poor fellow looked terribly anxious. torture suspense
 regarding woman loved, utter ignorance terrible
 mystery seemed surround intensified pain. very
 heart bleeding, took manhood him--and a
 royal lot it, too--to keep breaking down. paused before
 answering, felt must betray anything the
 professor wished kept secret; already knew much, guessed
 much, reason answering, answered
 phrase: “that’s so.”
 
“and long going on?”
 
“about ten days.”
 
“ten days! guess, jack seward, poor pretty creature
 love put veins within time blood
 four strong men. man alive, whole body wouldn’t hold it.” then,
 coming close me, spoke fierce half-whisper: “what took it
 out?”
 
shook head. “that,” said, “is crux. helsing simply
 frantic it, wits’ end. can’t even hazard guess.
 series little circumstances thrown out
 calculations lucy properly watched. shall
 occur again. stay well--or ill.” quincey held
 hand. “count in,” said. “you dutchman will tell me
 do, i’ll it.”
 
woke late afternoon, lucy’s first movement feel
 breast, and, surprise, produced paper helsing
 given read. careful professor replaced had
 come from, lest waking alarmed. eye lit van
 helsing too, gladdened. looked around room,
 seeing was, shuddered; gave loud cry, put her
 poor thin hands pale face. understood that
 meant--that realised full mother’s death; tried
 comfort her. doubtless sympathy eased somewhat, but
 low thought spirit, wept silently weakly for
 long time. told either us now remain with
 time, seemed comfort her. towards dusk fell
 doze. odd thing occurred. whilst still asleep she
 took paper breast tore two. helsing stepped
 took pieces her. same, however, went on
 action tearing, though material still her
 hands; finally lifted hands opened though scattering
 fragments. helsing seemed surprised, brows gathered as
 thought, said nothing.

_19 september._--all last night slept fitfully, always afraid
 sleep, something weaker woke it. professor and
 took turns watch, never left moment
 unattended. quincey morris said nothing intention, knew
 night long patrolled round round house.
 
day came, searching light showed ravages poor lucy’s
 strength. hardly able turn head, little
 nourishment take seemed good. times she
 slept, helsing noticed difference her, between
 sleeping waking. whilst asleep looked stronger, although more
 haggard, breathing softer; open mouth showed pale
 gums drawn back teeth, thus looked positively longer and
 sharper usual; woke softness eyes evidently
 changed expression, looked self, although dying
 one. afternoon asked arthur, telegraphed him.
 quincey went meet station.
 
arrived nearly six o’clock, sun setting full
 warm, red light streamed window gave more
 colour pale cheeks. saw her, arthur simply choking
 emotion, none us speak. hours passed,
 fits sleep, comatose condition passed it, had
 grown frequent, pauses conversation possible
 shortened. arthur’s presence, however, seemed act a
 stimulant; rallied little, spoke brightly she
 done since arrived. pulled together, spoke as
 cheerily could, best made everything.
 
now nearly one o’clock, helsing sitting with
 her. relieve quarter hour, entering
 lucy’s phonograph. six o’clock try rest. i
 fear to-morrow will end watching, shock too
 great; poor child rally. god help us all.

 odorous flowers. lucy breathing somewhat stertorously, and

 said, “my dear old fellow, summon fortitude: will best

came lucy’s room see helsing had, with
 usual forethought, putting matters straight making
 everything look pleasing possible. even brushed lucy’s
 hair, lay pillow usual sunny ripples. we
 came room opened eyes, seeing him, whispered
 softly:--
 
“arthur! oh, love, glad come!” stooping to
 kiss her, helsing motioned back. “no,” whispered, “not

arthur took hand knelt beside her, looked best,
 soft lines matching angelic beauty eyes. then
 gradually eyes closed, sank sleep. little bit her
 breast heaved softly, breath came went like tired child’s.
 
insensibly came strange change noticed in
 night. breathing grew stertorous, mouth opened, pale
 gums, drawn back, made teeth look longer sharper ever. a
 sort sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way opened eyes, which
 now dull hard once, said soft, voluptuous voice,
 never heard lips:--
 
“arthur! oh, love, glad come! kiss me!” arthur bent
 eagerly kiss her; instant helsing, who, like me,
 startled voice, swooped upon him, catching by
 neck hands, dragged back fury strength which
 never thought possessed, actually hurled almost
 across room.
 
“not life!” said; “not living soul hers!” and
 stood like lion bay.
 
arthur taken aback moment know do

kept eyes fixed lucy, helsing, saw spasm as
 rage flit like shadow face; sharp teeth champed
 together. eyes closed, breathed heavily.
 
shortly opened eyes softness, and
 putting poor, pale, thin hand, took helsing’s great brown
 one; drawing her, kissed it. “my true friend,” said, a
 faint voice, untellable pathos, “my true friend, his! oh,
 guard him, give peace!”
 
“i swear it!” said solemnly, kneeling beside holding his
 hand, one registers oath. turned arthur, said
 him: “come, child, take hand yours, kiss the
 forehead, once.”
 
eyes met instead lips; parted.
 
lucy’s eyes closed; helsing, watching closely, took
 arthur’s arm, drew away.
 
lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, it
 ceased.
 
“it over,” said helsing. “she dead!”
 
took arthur arm, led away drawing-room, he
 sat down, covered face hands, sobbing way that
 nearly broke see.
 
went back room, found helsing looking poor lucy, and

 death given back part beauty, brow cheeks had
 recovered flowing lines; even lips lost their
 deadly pallor. blood, longer needed working
 heart, gone make harshness death little rude as
 might be.

“ah, well, poor girl, peace last. end!”

 foreigner, might quite aware english legal requirements, and
 might ignorance make unnecessary trouble. answered me:--
 
“i know; know. forget lawyer well doctor. but
 altogether law. knew that, avoided the
 coroner. avoid. may papers more--such
 this.”
 
spoke took pocket-book memorandum been
 lucy’s breast, torn sleep.
 
“when find anything solicitor late mrs.
 westenra, seal papers, write to-night. me, watch
 room miss lucy’s old room night, myself
 search may be. well thoughts go into
 hands strangers.”
 
went part work, another half hour found
 name address mrs. westenra’s solicitor written to
 him. poor lady’s papers order; explicit directions
 regarding place burial given. hardly sealed the
 letter, when, surprise, helsing walked room,
 saying:--
 
“can help you, friend john? free, may, service to
 you.”
 
“have got looked for?” asked, replied:--
 
“i look specific thing. hoped find, find i
 have, was--only letters memoranda, a
 diary new begun. here, shall present say
 nothing them. shall see poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
 sanction, shall use some.”
 
finished work hand, said me:--
 
“and now, friend john, think may bed. want sleep, you
 i, rest recuperate. to-morrow shall much do, but
 to-night need us. alas!”
 
turning went look poor lucy. undertaker had
 certainly done work well, room turned small
 _chapelle ardente_. wilderness beautiful white flowers,
 death made little repulsive might be. end the
 winding-sheet laid face; professor bent and
 turned gently back, started beauty us, tall
 wax candles showing sufficient light note well. lucy’s
 loveliness come back death, hours passed,
 instead leaving traces “decay’s effacing fingers,” but
 restored beauty life, till positively believe eyes
 looking corpse.
 
professor looked sternly grave. loved had, and
 need tears eyes. said me: “remain till i
 return,” left room. came back handful wild garlic
 box waiting hall, opened, and
 placed flowers amongst others around bed. he
 took neck, inside collar, little gold crucifix, and
 placed mouth. restored sheet place, we
 came away.
 
undressing room, when, premonitory tap the
 door, entered, began speak:--
 
“to-morrow want bring me, night, set post-mortem
 knives.”
 
“must make autopsy?” asked.
 
“yes no. want operate, think. let tell you
 now, word another. want cut head take out
 heart. ah! surgeon, shocked! you, seen with
 tremble hand heart, operations life death make
 rest shudder. oh, must forget, dear friend john, that
 loved her; forgotten it, shall
 operate, must help. like to-night, for
 arthur must not; will free father’s funeral to-morrow,
 will want see her--to see _it_. then, coffined
 ready next day, shall come sleep. shall
 unscrew coffin-lid, shall operation: replace
 all, none know, save alone.”
 
“but all? girl dead. mutilate poor body
 without need? necessity post-mortem nothing
 gain it--no good her, us, science, human
 knowledge--why it? without monstrous.”
 
answer put hand shoulder, said, infinite
 tenderness:--
 
“friend john, pity poor bleeding heart; love more
 bleed. could, take burden

 shall know, bless knowing, though pleasant
 things. john, child, friend now many years, yet
 ever know without good cause? may err--i but

 horrified, let arthur kiss love--though was
 dying--and snatched away strength? yes! yet saw
 thanked me, beautiful dying eyes, voice, too, so
 weak, kiss rough old hand bless me? yes! not
 hear swear promise her, closed eyes grateful? yes!
 
“well, good reason now want do. many
 years trust me; believe weeks past, things so
 strange might well doubt. believe yet little, friend
 john. trust not, must tell think; is
 perhaps well. work--as work shall, matter trust no
 trust--without friend trust me, work heavy heart feel,
 oh! lonely want help courage may be!” paused a
 moment went solemnly: “friend john, strange and
 terrible days us. let us two, one, work to
 good end. will faith me?”
 
took hand, promised him. held door open went away,
 watched go room close door. stood without
 moving, saw one maids pass silently along passage--she had
 back towards me, see me--and go room lucy
 lay. sight touched me. devotion rare, grateful
 show unasked love. poor girl
 putting aside terrors naturally death go watch
 alone bier mistress loved, poor clay
 might lonely till laid eternal rest....

must slept long soundly, broad daylight van
 helsing waked coming room. came bedside and
 said:--
 
“you need trouble knives; shall it.”
 
“why not?” asked. solemnity night greatly
 impressed me.
 
“because,” said sternly, “it late--or early. see!” he
 held little golden crucifix. “this stolen night.”
 
“how, stolen,” asked wonder, “since now?”
 
“because get back worthless wretch stole it, the
 woman robbed dead living. punishment will surely
 come, me; knew altogether thus
 unknowing, stole. now must wait.”
 
went away word, leaving new mystery think of, a
 new puzzle grapple with.
 
forenoon dreary time, noon solicitor came: mr.
 marquand, wholeman, sons, marquand & lidderdale. genial
 appreciative done, took hands all
 cares details. lunch told us mrs. westenra for
 time expected sudden death heart, put affairs
 absolute order; informed us that, exception certain
 entailed property lucy’s father’s now, default direct
 issue, went back distant branch family, whole estate,
 real personal, left absolutely arthur holmwood. had
 told us much went on:--
 
“frankly best prevent testamentary disposition, and
 pointed certain contingencies might leave daughter either

 collision, asked us prepared carry out

 frankly, however, must admit case form of
 disposition rendered impossible carrying her

 you, dear sirs, rejoiced result, perfectly rejoiced.”
 
good fellow, rejoicing one little part--in which
 officially interested--of great tragedy, an
 object-lesson limitations sympathetic understanding.
 
remain long, said look later day and
 see lord godalming. coming, however, certain comfort to
 us, since assured us dread hostile
 criticism acts. arthur expected five o’clock, so
 little time visited death-chamber. in
 truth, now mother daughter lay it. undertaker,
 true craft, made best display goods, and
 mortuary air place lowered spirits at
 once. helsing ordered former arrangement adhered to,
 explaining that, lord godalming coming soon, be
 less harrowing feelings see left _fiancée_
 quite alone. undertaker seemed shocked stupidity and
 exerted restore things condition left them
 night before, arthur came shocks feelings
 avoid saved.
 
poor fellow! looked desperately sad broken; even stalwart
 manhood seemed shrunk somewhat strain his
 much-tried emotions. had, knew, genuinely devotedly
 attached father; lose him, time, a
 bitter blow him. warm ever, helsing he
 sweetly courteous; help seeing some
 constraint him. professor noticed it, too, motioned to
 bring upstairs. so, left door room, i
 felt like quite alone her, took arm and
 led in, saying huskily:--
 
“you loved too, old fellow; told it, was
 friend closer place heart you. don’t know to
 thank done her. can’t think yet....”
 
suddenly broke down, threw arms round shoulders and
 laid head breast, crying:--
 
“oh, jack! jack! shall do! whole life seems gone me
 once, nothing wide world live for.”
 
comforted well could. cases men need much
 expression. grip hand, tightening arm the
 shoulder, sob unison, expressions sympathy dear man’s
 heart. stood still silent till sobs died away, said
 softly him:--
 
“come look her.”
 
together moved bed, lifted lawn face.
 god! beautiful was. every hour seemed enhancing her
 loveliness. frightened amazed somewhat; arthur, he
 fell a-trembling, finally shaken doubt ague. at
 last, long pause, said faint whisper:--
 
“jack, really dead?”
 
assured sadly so, went suggest--for felt
 horrible doubt life moment longer than
 help--that often happened death faces became
 softened even resolved youthful beauty; was
 especially death preceded acute prolonged
 suffering. seemed quite away doubt, and, after
 kneeling beside couch looking lovingly and
 long, turned aside. told must good-bye, the
 coffin prepared; went back took dead hand his

 fondly looking back shoulder came.
 
left drawing-room, told helsing said
 good-bye; latter went kitchen tell undertaker’s men

 came room told arthur’s question, he
 replied:--
 
“i surprised. just now doubted moment myself!”
 
dined together, see poor art trying make
 best things. helsing silent dinner-time; but
 lit cigars said--
 
“lord----”; arthur interrupted him:--
 
“no, no, that, god’s sake! yet rate. forgive me, sir:
 mean speak offensively; loss so
 recent.”
 
professor answered sweetly:--
 
“i used name doubt. must call you
 ‘mr.,’ grown love you--yes, dear boy, love you--as
 arthur.”
 
arthur held hand, took old man’s warmly.
 
“call will,” said. “i hope may always title of
 friend. let say loss words thank for
 goodness poor dear.” paused moment, went on: “i know
 understood goodness even better do; was
 rude way wanting time acted so--you remember”--the
 professor nodded--“you must forgive me.”
 
answered grave kindness:--
 
“i know hard quite trust then, trust such
 violence needs understand; take not--that you

“and, indeed, indeed, sir,” said arthur warmly, “i shall ways
 trust you. know believe noble heart, are
 jack’s friend, hers. shall like.”
 
professor cleared throat couple times, though to
 speak, finally said:--
 
“may ask something now?”
 
“certainly.”
 
“you know mrs. westenra left property?”
 
“no, poor dear; never thought it.”
 
“and yours, right deal will. i

arthur spoke heartily, like old self:--
 
“dr. helsing, may will. feel saying i

old professor stood said solemnly:--
 
“and right. will pain us all; will be

_22 september._--in train exeter. jonathan sleeping.
 
seems yesterday last entry made, yet much
 then, whitby world me, jonathan away and
 news him; now, married jonathan, jonathan solicitor, a
 partner, rich, master business, mr. hawkins dead buried, and
 jonathan another attack may harm him. day may ask me
 it. goes. rusty shorthand--see what
 unexpected prosperity us--so may well freshen up
 exercise anyhow....
 
service simple solemn. ourselves
 servants there, one two old friends exeter, his
 london agent, gentleman representing sir john paxton, the
 president incorporated law society. jonathan stood hand in
 hand, felt best dearest friend gone us....
 
came back town quietly, taking ’bus hyde park corner.
 jonathan thought interest go row while, so
 sat down; people there, was
 sad-looking desolate see many empty chairs. made us think
 empty chair home; got walked piccadilly.
 jonathan holding arm, way used old days
 went school. felt improper, can’t go on
 years teaching etiquette decorum girls without the
 pedantry biting bit; jonathan, he
 husband, didn’t know anybody saw us--and didn’t
 care did--so walked. looking beautiful
 girl, big cart-wheel hat, sitting victoria outside guiliano’s,
 felt jonathan clutch arm tight hurt me, said
 breath: “my god!” always anxious jonathan, i
 fear nervous fit may upset again; turned him
 quickly, asked disturbed him.
 
pale, eyes seemed bulging as, half terror and
 half amazement, gazed tall, thin man, beaky nose and
 black moustache pointed beard, also observing pretty
 girl. looking hard see either us,
 good view him. face good face; was
 hard, cruel, sensual, big white teeth, looked all
 whiter lips red, pointed like animal’s.
 jonathan kept staring him, till afraid notice. i
 feared might take ill, looked fierce nasty. asked
 jonathan disturbed, answered, evidently thinking that
 knew much did: “do see is?”
 
“no, dear,” said; “i don’t know him; it?” answer seemed to
 shock thrill me, said know was
 me, mina, speaking:--
 
“it man himself!”
 
poor dear evidently terrified something--very greatly
 terrified; believe lean to
 support sunk down. kept staring; man came of
 shop small parcel, gave lady, drove
 off. dark man kept eyes fixed her, carriage
 moved piccadilly followed direction, hailed a
 hansom. jonathan kept looking him, said, himself:--
 
“i believe count, grown young. god, be
 so! oh, god! god! knew! knew!” was
 distressing much feared keep mind the
 subject asking questions, remained silent. drew him
 away quietly, he, holding arm, came easily. walked little
 further, went sat green park. was
 hot day autumn, comfortable seat shady place.
 minutes’ staring nothing, jonathan’s eyes closed, he
 went quietly sleep, head shoulder. thought it
 best thing him, disturb him. twenty
 minutes woke up, said quite cheerfully:--
 
“why, mina, asleep! oh, forgive rude.
 come, we’ll cup tea somewhere.” evidently forgotten
 dark stranger, illness forgotten that
 episode reminded of. don’t like lapsing into
 forgetfulness; may make continue injury brain. must
 ask him, fear shall harm good; must somehow
 learn facts journey abroad. time come, fear, i
 must open parcel, know written. oh, jonathan, will,
 know, forgive wrong, dear sake.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--a sad home-coming every way--the house empty dear
 soul good us; jonathan still pale dizzy slight
 relapse malady; now telegram helsing, whoever he
 may be:--
 
“you will grieved hear mrs. westenra died five days ago, and
 lucy died day yesterday. buried to-day.”
 
oh, wealth sorrow words! poor mrs. westenra! poor
 lucy! gone, gone, never return us! poor, poor arthur, have
 lost sweetness life! god help us bear our
 troubles.

 made personally. stop then, can; says
 work london may take time. poor old
 fellow! fear strain past week broken even his
 iron strength. time burial was, see, putting
 terrible restraint himself. over, were
 standing beside arthur, who, poor fellow, speaking part in
 operation blood transfused lucy’s veins; i
 see helsing’s face grow white purple turns. arthur was
 saying felt since two really married
 wife sight god. none us said word of
 operations, none us ever shall. arthur quincey went
 away together station, helsing came here. the
 moment alone carriage gave way regular fit of
 hysterics. denied since hysterics, insisted
 sense humour asserting very
 terrible conditions. laughed till cried, draw down
 blinds lest one see us misjudge; cried,
 till laughed again; laughed cried together, just woman
 does. tried stern him, one woman the
 circumstances; effect. men women different in
 manifestations nervous strength weakness! face grew
 grave stern asked mirth, time.
 reply way characteristic him, logical and
 forceful mysterious. said:--
 
“ah, don’t comprehend, friend john. think sad,
 though laugh. see, cried even laugh choke me. but
 think sorry cry, laugh come
 just same. keep always laughter knock your
 door say, ‘may come in?’ true laughter. no! a
 king, come like. ask person; choose no
 time suitability. say, ‘i here.’ behold, example grieve my
 heart sweet young girl; give blood her, though
 old worn; give time, skill, sleep; let other
 sufferers want may all. yet can laugh very
 grave--laugh clay spade sexton drop upon her
 coffin say ‘thud! thud!’ heart, till send back blood
 cheek. heart bleed poor boy--that dear boy, of
 age mine boy blessed live, his
 hair eyes same. there, know now love so. yet
 say things touch husband-heart quick, make my
 father-heart yearn man--not even you, friend
 john, level experiences father son--yet even
 moment king laugh come shout bellow ear,
 ‘here am! am!’ till blood come dance back bring of
 sunshine carry cheek. oh, friend john, is
 strange world, sad world, world full miseries, woes, and
 troubles; yet king laugh come make dance the
 tune play. bleeding hearts, dry bones churchyard, and
 tears burn fall--all dance together music he
 make smileless mouth him. believe me, friend john, that
 good come, kind. ah, men women like ropes drawn
 tight strain pull us different ways. tears come; and,
 like rain ropes, brace us up, perhaps strain
 become great, break. king laugh come like the
 sunshine, ease strain again; bear go with
 labour, may be.”
 
like wound pretending see idea; but, i
 yet understand cause laughter, asked him. he
 answered face grew stern, said quite different
 tone:--
 
“oh, grim irony all--this lovely lady garlanded with
 flowers, looked fair life, till one one wondered she
 truly dead; laid fine marble house lonely
 churchyard, rest many kin, laid mother
 loved her, loved; sacred bell going ‘toll!
 toll! toll!’ sad slow; holy men, white
 garments angel, pretending read books, yet time
 eyes never page; us bowed head. all
 what? dead; so! not?”
 
“well, life me, professor,” said, “i can’t see anything to
 laugh that. why, explanation makes harder puzzle
 before. even burial service comic, poor
 art trouble? why, heart simply breaking.”
 
“just so. said transfusion blood veins had
 made truly bride?”
 
“yes, sweet comforting idea him.”
 
“quite so. difficulty, friend john. that, then
 others? ho, ho! sweet maid polyandrist,
 me, poor wife dead me, alive church’s law, though
 wits, gone--even i, faithful husband now-no-wife,
 bigamist.”
 
“i don’t see joke comes either!” said; did
 feel particularly pleased saying things. laid
 hand arm, said:--
 
“friend john, forgive pain. showed feeling others
 wound, you, old friend, can trust.
 looked heart want laugh;
 done laugh arrived; so
 now, king laugh pack crown, him--for
 go far, far away me, long, long time--maybe would
 perhaps pity all.”
 
touched tenderness tone, asked why.
 
“because know!”
 
now scattered; many long day loneliness will
 sit roofs brooding wings. lucy lies tomb her
 kin, lordly death-house lonely churchyard, away teeming
 london; air fresh, sun rises hampstead hill,
 wild flowers grow accord.
 
can finish diary; god knows shall ever begin
 another. do, even open again, will deal with
 different people different themes; end, the
 romance life told, ere go back take thread my

 work enthusiasm used it, might
 fairly said wound poor lucy left becoming
 cicatrised. everything is, however, now reopened; the
 end god knows. idea helsing thinks knows,
 too, will let enough time whet curiosity. he
 went exeter yesterday, stayed night. to-day came
 back, almost bounded room half-past five o’clock,
 thrust last night’s “westminster gazette” hand.
 
“what think that?” asked stood back folded his
 arms.
 
looked paper, really know meant; he
 took pointed paragraph children decoyed

 passage described small punctured wounds throats. an
 idea struck me, looked up. “well?” said.
 
“it like poor lucy’s.”
 
“and make it?”
 
“simply cause common. whatever injured
 injured them.” quite understand answer:--
 
“that true indirectly, directly.”
 
“how mean, professor?” asked. little inclined take
 seriousness lightly--for, all, four days rest freedom
 burning, harrowing anxiety help restore one’s spirits--but
 saw face, sobered me. never, even midst our
 despair poor lucy, looked stern.
 
“tell me!” said. “i can hazard opinion. know to
 think, data found conjecture.”
 
“do mean tell me, friend john, suspicion to
 poor lucy died of; hints given, by
 events, me?”
 
“of nervous prostration following great loss waste blood.”
 
“and blood lost waste?” shook head. stepped and
 sat beside me, went on:--
 
“you clever man, friend john; reason well, wit bold;
 prejudiced. let eyes see ears

 yet are; people see things others cannot? but
 things old new must contemplate men’s

 told them. ah, fault science wants to
 explain all; explain not, says nothing to

“yes,” said. “charcot proved pretty well.” smiled he
 went on: “then satisfied it. yes? course you

“good god, professor!” said, starting up. “do mean tell that

 on:--
 
“can tell tortoise lives long generations of

dr. seward’s diary--_continued_.
 

sheer anger mastered me; life
 struck lucy face. smote table hard rose said to
 him:--
 
“dr. helsing, mad?” raised head looked me, and
 somehow tenderness face calmed once. “would were!” he
 said. “madness easy bear compared truth like this. oh, my
 friend, why, think you, go far round, take long tell
 simple thing? hate hated all
 life? wished give pain? wanted,
 now late, revenge time saved life, a
 fearful death? ah no!”
 
“forgive me,” said i. went on:--
 
“my friend, wished gentle breaking you,
 know loved sweet lady. even yet not
 expect believe. hard accept abstract
 truth, may doubt possible always
 believed ‘no’ it; hard still accept sad a
 concrete truth, one miss lucy. to-night go prove
 it. dare come me?”
 
staggered me. man like prove truth; byron
 excepted category, jealousy.
 
“and prove truth abhorred.”
 
saw hesitation, spoke:--
 
“the logic simple, madman’s logic time, jumping tussock
 tussock misty bog. true, proof will relief;
 worst will harm. true! ah, dread; yet
 dread help cause, need belief. come,
 tell propose: first, go now see child
 hospital. dr. vincent, north hospital, papers
 say child is, friend mine, think since were
 class amsterdam. will let two scientists see case, he
 will let two friends. shall tell nothing, we
 wish learn. then----”
 
“and then?” took key pocket held up. “and we
 spend night, i, churchyard lucy lies. is
 key lock tomb. coffin-man give to
 arthur.” heart sank within me, felt fearful
 ordeal us. nothing, however, plucked what
 heart said better hasten, afternoon was
 passing....
 
found child awake. sleep taken food, and
 altogether going well. dr. vincent took bandage its
 throat, showed us punctures. mistaking the
 similarity lucy’s throat. smaller,
 edges looked fresher; all. asked vincent he
 attributed them, replied must bite some
 animal, perhaps rat; but, part, inclined think
 one bats numerous northern
 heights london. “out many harmless ones,” said, “there may
 wild specimen south malignant species. some
 sailor may brought one home, managed escape; even from
 zoölogical gardens young one may got loose, one bred
 vampire. things occur, know. ten days ago
 wolf got out, was, believe, traced direction. a
 week after, children playing nothing red riding hood the
 heath every alley place ‘bloofer lady’ scare
 came along, since quite gala-time them. even
 poor little mite, woke to-day, asked nurse he
 might go away. asked wanted go, said wanted
 play ‘bloofer lady.’”
 
“i hope,” said helsing, “that sending child home
 will caution parents keep strict watch it. fancies
 stray dangerous; child remain another
 night, probably fatal. case suppose will
 let away days?”
 
“certainly not, week least; longer wound not
 healed.”
 
visit hospital took time reckoned on, and
 sun dipped came out. helsing saw dark it
 was, said:--
 
“there hurry. late thought. come, let us seek
 somewhere may eat, shall go way.”
 
dined “jack straw’s castle” along little crowd of
 bicyclists others genially noisy. ten o’clock we
 started inn. dark, scattered lamps
 made darkness greater outside individual
 radius. professor evidently noted road go, he
 went unhesitatingly; but, me, quite mixup to
 locality. went further, met fewer fewer people, till at
 last somewhat surprised met even patrol horse
 police going usual suburban round. last reached wall of
 churchyard, climbed over. little difficulty--for
 dark, whole place seemed strange us--we found
 westenra tomb. professor took key, opened creaky door,
 standing back, politely, quite unconsciously, motioned to
 precede him. delicious irony offer, the
 courtliness giving preference ghastly occasion. my
 companion followed quickly, cautiously drew door to, after
 carefully ascertaining lock falling, spring,
 one. latter case bad plight. he
 fumbled bag, taking matchbox piece candle,
 proceeded make light. tomb day-time, wreathed
 fresh flowers, looked grim gruesome enough; now, some
 days afterwards, flowers hung lank dead, whites
 turning rust greens browns; spider the
 beetle resumed accustomed dominance; time-discoloured
 stone, dust-encrusted mortar, rusty, dank iron, tarnished
 brass, clouded silver-plating gave back feeble glimmer a
 candle, effect miserable sordid been
 imagined. conveyed irresistibly idea life--animal life--was
 thing pass away.
 
helsing went work systematically. holding candle so
 read coffin plates, holding sperm
 dropped white patches congealed touched metal, he
 made assurance lucy’s coffin. another search bag, took
 turnscrew.
 
“what going do?” asked.
 
“to open coffin. shall yet convinced.” straightway began
 taking screws, finally lifted lid, showing the
 casing lead beneath. sight almost much me. seemed
 much affront dead have
 stripped clothing sleep whilst living; actually took
 hold hand stop him. said: “you shall see,” again
 fumbling bag, took tiny fret-saw. striking turnscrew
 lead swift downward stab, made wince, he
 made small hole, was, however, big enough admit point of
 saw. expected rush gas week-old corpse. we
 doctors, study dangers, become accustomed to
 things, drew back towards door. professor never
 stopped moment; sawed couple feet along one side of
 lead coffin, across, side. taking the
 edge loose flange, bent back towards foot the
 coffin, holding candle aperture, motioned to
 look.
 
drew near looked. coffin empty.
 
certainly surprise me, gave considerable shock, but
 helsing unmoved. now sure ever ground,
 emboldened proceed task. “are satisfied now, friend
 john?” asked.
 
felt dogged argumentativeness nature awake within as
 answered him:--
 
“i satisfied lucy’s body coffin; only
 proves one thing.”
 
“and that, friend john?”
 
“that there.”
 
“that good logic,” said, “so far goes. you--how
 can you--account there?”
 
“perhaps body-snatcher,” suggested. “some undertaker’s people
 may stolen it.” felt speaking folly, yet was
 real cause suggest. professor sighed. “ah
 well!” said, “we must proof. come me.”
 
put coffin-lid again, gathered things placed
 bag, blew light, placed candle also the
 bag. opened door, went out. behind us closed door and
 locked it. handed key, saying: “will keep it? had
 better assured.” laughed--it cheerful laugh, am
 bound say--as motioned keep it. “a key nothing,” said;
 “there may duplicates; anyhow difficult pick lock
 kind.” said nothing, put key pocket. he
 told watch one side churchyard whilst watch at
 other. took place behind yew-tree, saw dark
 figure move intervening headstones trees hid my
 sight.
 
lonely vigil. just taken place heard distant
 clock strike twelve, time came one two. chilled and
 unnerved, angry professor taking errand
 coming. cold sleepy keenly
 observant, sleepy enough betray trust altogether had
 dreary, miserable time.
 
suddenly, turned round, thought saw something like white
 streak, moving two dark yew-trees side churchyard
 farthest tomb; time dark mass moved the
 professor’s side ground, hurriedly went towards it. i
 moved; go round headstones railed-off tombs, i
 stumbled graves. sky overcast, somewhere far an
 early cock crew. little way off, beyond line scattered
 juniper-trees, marked pathway church, white, dim
 figure flitted direction tomb. tomb hidden
 trees, see figure disappeared. heard the
 rustle actual movement first seen white figure, and
 coming over, found professor holding arms tiny child. when
 saw held me, said:--
 
“are satisfied now?”
 
“no,” said, way felt aggressive.
 
“do see child?”
 
“yes, child, brought here? wounded?” i
 asked.
 
“we shall see,” said professor, one impulse took way
 churchyard, carrying sleeping child.
 
got little distance away, went clump of
 trees, struck match, looked child’s throat. was
 without scratch scar kind.
 
“was right?” asked triumphantly.
 
“we just time,” said professor thankfully.
 
now decide child, consulted
 it. take police-station to
 give account movements night; least, should
 make statement come find child.
 finally decided take heath, we
 heard policeman coming, leave fail find
 it; seek way home quickly could. fell out
 well. edge hampstead heath heard policeman’s heavy
 tramp, laying child pathway, waited watched until
 saw flashed lantern fro. heard exclamation
 astonishment, went away silently. good chance got a
 cab near “spaniards,” drove town.
 
sleep, make entry. must try get hours’
 sleep, helsing call noon. insists shall
 go another expedition.

_27 september._--it two o’clock found suitable
 opportunity attempt. funeral held noon completed,
 last stragglers mourners taken lazily
 away, when, looking carefully behind clump alder-trees, saw
 sexton lock gate him. knew safe till
 morning desire it; professor told not
 want hour most. felt horrid sense the
 reality things, effort imagination seemed of
 place; realised distinctly perils law were
 incurring unhallowed work. besides, felt useless.
 outrageous open leaden coffin, see woman dead
 nearly week really dead, now seemed height folly to
 open tomb again, knew, evidence own
 eyesight, coffin empty. shrugged shoulders, however,
 rested silent, helsing way going road,
 matter remonstrated. took key, opened vault, again
 courteously motioned precede. place gruesome as
 last night, oh, unutterably mean-looking sunshine
 streamed in. helsing walked lucy’s coffin, followed.
 bent forced back leaden flange; shock
 surprise dismay shot me.
 
lay lucy, seemingly just seen night her
 funeral. was, possible, radiantly beautiful ever; i
 believe dead. lips red, nay redder than
 before; cheeks delicate bloom.
 
“is juggle?” said him.
 
“are convinced now?” said professor response, spoke
 put hand, way made shudder, pulled back the
 dead lips showed white teeth.
 
“see,” went on, “see, even sharper before. this
 this”--and touched one canine teeth below
 it--“the little children can bitten. belief now, friend
 john?” more, argumentative hostility woke within me. _could_ not
 accept overwhelming idea suggested; so, attempt to
 argue even moment ashamed, said:--
 
“she may placed since last night.”
 
“indeed? so, whom?”
 
“i know. one done it.”
 
“and yet dead one week. peoples time not
 look so.” answer this, silent. helsing not
 seem notice silence; rate, showed neither chagrin nor
 triumph. looking intently face dead woman, raising
 eyelids looking eyes, opening lips and
 examining teeth. turned said:--
 
“here, one thing different recorded; is
 dual life common. bitten vampire
 trance, sleep-walking--oh, start; know
 that, friend john, shall know later--and trance could
 best come take blood. trance died, trance she
 un-dead, too. differ other. usually when
 un-dead sleep home”--as spoke made comprehensive sweep of
 arm designate vampire “home”--“their face show what
 are, sweet un-dead go back to
 nothings common dead. malign there, see, so
 make hard must kill sleep.” turned blood
 cold, began dawn upon accepting helsing’s
 theories; really dead, terror the
 idea killing her? looked me, evidently saw change in
 face, said almost joyously:--
 
“ah, believe now?”
 
answered: “do press hard once. willing to
 accept. will bloody work?”
 
“i shall cut head fill mouth garlic, shall
 drive stake body.” made shudder think so
 mutilating body woman loved. yet feeling
 strong expected. was, fact, beginning to
 shudder presence being, un-dead, helsing
 called it, loathe it. possible love subjective,
 objective?
 
waited considerable time helsing begin, stood as
 wrapped thought. presently closed catch bag a
 snap, said:--
 
“i thinking, made mind best. i

 arthur quincey came helsing’s room; told us he
 wanted us do, especially addressing arthur, all
 wills centred his. began saying hoped would
 come too, “for,” said, “there grave duty done
 there. doubtless surprised letter?” query was
 directly addressed lord godalming.
 
“i was. rather upset bit. much trouble
 around house late without more. been
 curious, too, mean. quincey talked over; the
 talked, puzzled got, till now can say myself
 i’m tree meaning anything.”
 
“me too,” said quincey morris laconically.
 
“oh,” said professor, “then nearer beginning, of
 you, friend john here, go long way back can
 even get far begin.”
 
evident recognised return old doubting frame of
 mind without saying word. then, turning two, said
 intense gravity:--
 
“i want permission think good night. is, i
 know, much ask; know propose will
 know, then, much. therefore may ask promise me
 dark, afterwards, though may angry a
 time--i must disguise possibility may
 be--you shall blame anything.”
 
“that’s frank anyhow,” broke quincey. “i’ll answer professor.
 don’t quite see drift, swear he’s honest; that’s good
 enough me.”
 
“i thank you, sir,” said helsing proudly. “i done the
 honour counting one trusting friend, endorsement dear
 me.” held hand, quincey took.
 
arthur spoke out:--
 
“dr. helsing, don’t quite like ‘buy pig poke,’ they
 say scotland, anything honour gentleman
 faith christian concerned, make promise.
 can assure intend violate either of
 two, give consent once; though life me, i
 understand driving at.”
 
“i accept limitation,” said helsing, “and ask is
 feel necessary condemn act mine, will first
 consider well satisfied violate your
 reservations.”
 
“agreed!” said arthur; “that fair. now the
 _pourparlers_ over, may ask do?”
 
“i want come me, come secret, churchyard at
 kingstead.”
 
arthur’s face fell said amazed sort way:--
 
“where poor lucy buried?” professor bowed. arthur went on: “and
 there?”
 
“to enter tomb!” arthur stood up.
 
“professor, earnest; monstrous joke? pardon me,
 see earnest.” sat again, see that
 sat firmly proudly, one dignity. was
 silence asked again:--
 
“and tomb?”
 
“to open coffin.”
 
“this much!” said, angrily rising again. “i willing be
 patient things reasonable; this--this desecration
 grave--of one who----” fairly choked indignation. the
 professor looked pityingly him.
 
“if spare one pang, poor friend,” said, “god knows i
 would. night feet must tread thorny paths; later, and
 ever, feet love must walk paths flame!”
 
arthur looked set white face said:--
 
“take care, sir, take care!”
 
“would well hear say?” said helsing.
 “and will least know limit purpose. shall go
 on?”
 
“that’s fair enough,” broke morris.
 
pause helsing went on, evidently effort:--
 
“miss lucy dead; so? yes! can wrong to
 her. dead----”
 
arthur jumped feet.
 
“good god!” cried. “what mean? mistake; has
 buried alive?” groaned anguish even hope could
 soften.
 
“i say alive, child; think it. go no
 say might un-dead.”
 
“un-dead! alive! mean? nightmare, what
 it?”
 
“there mysteries men can guess at, age age they
 may solve part. believe me, now verge one. but
 done. may cut head dead miss lucy?”
 
“heavens earth, no!” cried arthur storm passion. “not for
 wide world will consent mutilation dead body. dr.
 helsing, try far. done should
 torture so? poor, sweet girl want to
 cast dishonour grave? mad speak things, or
 mad listen them? don’t dare think a
 desecration; shall give consent anything do. a
 duty protecting grave outrage; and, god, shall do
 it!”
 
helsing rose time seated, and
 said, gravely sternly:--
 
“my lord godalming, i, too, duty do, duty others, duty
 you, duty dead; and, god, shall it! ask you
 now come me, look listen; when
 later make request eager its
 fulfilment even am, then--then shall duty, whatever it
 may seem me. then, follow lordship’s wishes shall
 hold disposal render account you, where
 will.” voice broke little, went voice full of
 pity:--
 
“but, beseech you, go forth anger me. long life of
 acts often pleasant do, sometimes wring
 heart, never heavy task now. believe if
 time comes change mind towards me, one look from
 will wipe away sad hour, man can
 save sorrow. just think. give so
 much labour much sorrow? come land
 can good; first please friend john, and
 help sweet young lady, whom, too, came love. her--i
 ashamed say much, say kindness--i gave you
 gave; blood veins; gave it, i, not, like you, her
 lover, physician friend. gave nights
 days--before death, death; death can good
 even now, dead un-dead, shall freely.” he
 said grave, sweet pride, arthur much affected
 it. took old man’s hand said broken voice:--
 
“oh, hard think it, understand; least i
 shall go wait.”

dr. seward’s diary--_continued_
 

just quarter twelve o’clock got the
 churchyard low wall. night dark occasional gleams
 moonlight rents heavy clouds scudded across
 sky. kept somehow close together, helsing slightly
 front led way. come close tomb looked
 well arthur, feared proximity place laden so
 sorrowful memory upset him; bore well. took it
 mystery proceeding way counteractant
 grief. professor unlocked door, seeing natural
 hesitation amongst us various reasons, solved difficulty by
 entering first himself. rest us followed, closed door.
 lit dark lantern pointed coffin. arthur stepped
 forward hesitatingly; helsing said me:--
 
“you yesterday. body miss lucy that
 coffin?”
 
“it was.” professor turned rest saying:--
 
“you hear; yet one believe me.” he
 took screwdriver took lid coffin. arthur
 looked on, pale silent; lid removed stepped
 forward. evidently know leaden coffin, or,
 rate, thought it. saw rent lead,
 blood rushed face instant, quickly fell away
 again, remained ghastly whiteness; still silent.
 helsing forced back leaden flange, looked and
 recoiled.
 
coffin empty!
 
several minutes one spoke word. silence broken by
 quincey morris:--
 
“professor, answered you. word want. wouldn’t ask
 thing ordinarily--i wouldn’t dishonour imply a
 doubt; mystery goes beyond honour dishonour.
 doing?”
 
“i swear hold sacred removed nor
 touched her. happened this: two nights ago friend seward and
 came here--with good purpose, believe me. opened coffin, which
 sealed up, found it, now, empty. waited, and
 saw something white come trees. next day came in
 day-time, lay there. not, friend john?”
 
“yes.”
 
“that night just time. one small child missing,
 find it, thank god, unharmed amongst graves. yesterday came
 sundown, sundown un-dead can move. waited here
 night till sun rose, saw nothing. probable
 laid clamps doors garlic,
 un-dead bear, things shun. last
 night exodus, to-night sundown took away my
 garlic things. find coffin empty. but
 bear me. far much strange. wait me
 outside, unseen unheard, things much stranger yet be.
 so”--here shut dark slide lantern--“now outside.”
 opened door, filed out, coming last locking the
 door behind him.
 
oh! seemed fresh pure night air terror of
 vault. sweet see clouds race by, passing
 gleams moonlight scudding clouds crossing and
 passing--like gladness sorrow man’s life; sweet was
 breathe fresh air, taint death decay; how
 humanising see red lighting sky beyond hill, to
 hear far away muffled roar marks life great city. each
 way solemn overcome. arthur silent, was, i
 see, striving grasp purpose inner meaning the
 mystery. tolerably patient, half inclined to
 throw aside doubt accept helsing’s conclusions. quincey
 morris phlegmatic way man accepts things, and
 accepts spirit cool bravery, hazard to
 stake. able smoke, cut good-sized plug of
 tobacco began chew. helsing, employed a
 definite way. first took bag mass looked like
 thin, wafer-like biscuit, carefully rolled white
 napkin; next took double-handful whitish stuff, like
 dough putty. crumbled wafer fine worked the
 mass hands. took, rolling thin
 strips, began lay crevices door its
 setting tomb. somewhat puzzled this, close,
 asked doing. arthur quincey drew near
 also, curious. answered:--
 
“i closing tomb, un-dead may enter.”
 
“and stuff put going it?” asked quincey.
 “great scott! game?”
 
“it is.”
 
“what using?” time question by
 arthur. helsing reverently lifted hat answered:--
 
“the host. brought amsterdam. indulgence.” an
 answer appalled sceptical us, felt individually
 presence earnest purpose professor’s, a
 purpose thus use sacred things, was
 impossible distrust. respectful silence took places
 assigned us close round tomb, hidden sight any
 one approaching. pitied others, especially arthur. myself
 apprenticed former visits watching horror; yet i,
 hour ago repudiated proofs, felt heart sink
 within me. never tombs look ghastly white; never cypress, or
 yew, juniper seem embodiment funereal gloom; never tree
 grass wave rustle ominously; never bough creak so
 mysteriously; never far-away howling dogs send a
 woeful presage night.
 
long spell silence, big, aching void, the
 professor keen “s-s-s-s!” pointed; far avenue yews
 saw white figure advance--a dim white figure, held something
 dark breast. figure stopped, moment ray of
 moonlight fell upon masses driving clouds showed startling
 prominence dark-haired woman, dressed cerements grave.
 see face, bent saw a
 fair-haired child. pause sharp little cry, a
 child gives sleep, dog lies fire dreams. we
 starting forward, professor’s warning hand, seen us as
 stood behind yew-tree, kept us back; looked the
 white figure moved forwards again. now near enough us see
 clearly, moonlight still held. heart grew cold ice,
 hear gasp arthur, recognised features of
 lucy westenra. lucy westenra, yet changed. sweetness was
 turned adamantine, heartless cruelty, purity voluptuous
 wantonness. helsing stepped out, and, obedient gesture, we
 advanced too; four us ranged line door the
 tomb. helsing raised lantern drew slide; the
 concentrated light fell lucy’s face see lips
 crimson fresh blood, stream trickled her
 chin stained purity lawn death-robe.
 
shuddered horror. see tremulous light even
 helsing’s iron nerve failed. arthur next me, had
 seized arm held up, fallen.
 
lucy--i call thing us lucy bore her
 shape--saw us drew back angry snarl, cat gives
 taken unawares; eyes ranged us. lucy’s eyes form
 colour; lucy’s eyes unclean full hell-fire, instead of
 pure, gentle orbs knew. moment remnant love
 passed hate loathing; killed, have
 done savage delight. looked, eyes blazed unholy
 light, face became wreathed voluptuous smile. oh, god,
 made shudder see it! careless motion, flung to
 ground, callous devil, child now had
 clutched strenuously breast, growling dog growls
 bone. child gave sharp cry, lay moaning. there
 cold-bloodedness act wrung groan arthur; when
 advanced outstretched arms wanton smile fell
 back hid face hands.
 
still advanced, however, languorous, voluptuous grace,
 said:--
 
“come me, arthur. leave others come me. arms are
 hungry you. come, can rest together. come, husband, come!”
 
something diabolically sweet tones--something the
 tingling glass struck--which rang brains even us
 heard words addressed another. arthur, seemed under
 spell; moving hands face, opened wide arms. she
 leaping them, helsing sprang forward held between
 little golden crucifix. recoiled it, and, a
 suddenly distorted face, full rage, dashed past enter
 tomb.
 
within foot two door, however, stopped, if
 arrested irresistible force. turned, face was
 shown clear burst moonlight lamp, now no
 quiver helsing’s iron nerves. never see baffled
 malice face; never, trust, shall ever seen by
 mortal eyes. beautiful colour became livid, eyes seemed throw
 sparks hell-fire, brows wrinkled though folds of
 flesh coils medusa’s snakes, lovely,
 blood-stained mouth grew open square, passion masks of
 greeks japanese. ever face meant death--if looks could
 kill--we saw moment.
 
full half minute, seemed eternity, remained
 lifted crucifix sacred closing means of
 entry. helsing broke silence asking arthur:--
 
“answer me, oh friend! proceed work?”
 
arthur threw knees, hid face hands, he
 answered:--
 
“do will, friend; will. can horror like
 ever more;” groaned spirit. quincey i
 simultaneously moved towards him, took arms. hear the
 click closing lantern helsing held down; coming close
 tomb, began remove chinks sacred
 emblem placed there. looked horrified
 amazement saw, stood back, woman, corporeal
 body real moment own, pass interstice
 scarce knife-blade gone. felt glad sense of
 relief saw professor calmly restoring strings putty
 edges door.
 
done, lifted child said:
 
“come now, friends; can till to-morrow. a
 funeral noon, shall come long that. the
 friends dead will gone two, sexton lock
 gate shall remain. do; like of
 to-night. little one, much harm, to-morrow
 night shall well. shall leave police will find
 him, night; home.” coming close arthur,
 said:--
 
“my friend arthur, sore trial; after, look
 back, will see necessary. now bitter
 waters, child. time to-morrow will, please god, have
 passed them, drunk sweet waters; mourn
 overmuch. till shall ask forgive me.”
 
arthur quincey came home me, tried cheer other
 way. left child safety, tired; all
 slept less reality sleep.
 
* * * * *
 
_29 september, night._--a little twelve o’clock three--arthur,
 quincey morris, myself--called professor. odd to
 notice common consent put black clothes. of
 course, arthur wore black, deep mourning, rest of
 us wore instinct. got churchyard half-past one, and
 strolled about, keeping official observation, the
 gravediggers completed task sexton belief
 every one gone, locked gate, place to
 ourselves. helsing, instead little black bag, a
 long leather one, something like cricketing bag; manifestly of
 fair weight.
 
alone heard last footsteps die up
 road, silently, ordered intention, followed the
 professor tomb. unlocked door, entered, closing it
 behind us. took bag lantern, lit, also
 two wax candles, which, lighted, stuck, melting own
 ends, coffins, might give light sufficient work
 by. lifted lid lucy’s coffin looked--arthur
 trembling like aspen--and saw body lay its
 death-beauty. love heart, nothing but
 loathing foul thing taken lucy’s shape without her
 soul. see even arthur’s face grow hard looked. presently
 said helsing:--
 
“is really lucy’s body, demon shape?”
 
“it body, yet it. wait while, see her
 was, is.”
 
seemed like nightmare lucy lay there; pointed teeth,
 bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which made one shudder to
 see--the whole carnal unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
 devilish mockery lucy’s sweet purity. helsing, usual
 methodicalness, began taking various contents bag and
 placing ready use. first took soldering iron some
 plumbing solder, small oil-lamp, gave out, lit in
 corner tomb, gas burned fierce heat blue
 flame; operating knives, placed hand; last a
 round wooden stake, two half three inches thick about
 three feet long. one end hardened charring fire, and
 sharpened fine point. stake came heavy hammer, such
 households used coal-cellar breaking lumps. to
 me, doctor’s preparations work kind stimulating and
 bracing, effect things arthur quincey was
 cause sort consternation. both, however, kept their
 courage, remained silent quiet.
 
ready, helsing said:--
 
“before anything, let tell this; lore and
 experience ancients studied powers
 un-dead. become such, comes change the
 curse immortality; die, must go age age
 adding new victims multiplying evils world; that
 die preying un-dead becomes un-dead, prey
 kind. circle goes ever widening, like the
 ripples stone thrown water. friend arthur, met
 kiss know poor lucy die; again, last night
 open arms her, time, died,
 become _nosferatu_, call eastern europe, would
 time make un-deads fill us horror.
 career unhappy dear lady just begun. those
 children whose blood suck yet much worse; if
 live on, un-dead, lose blood her
 power come her; draw blood that
 wicked mouth. die truth, cease; tiny
 wounds throats disappear, go back plays
 unknowing ever been. blessed all, when
 now un-dead made rest true dead, soul poor
 lady love shall free. instead working wickedness by
 night growing debased assimilating day, she
 shall take place angels. that, friend, will
 blessed hand shall strike blow sets free.
 willing; none amongst us better
 right? will joy think hereafter silence the
 night sleep not: ‘it hand sent stars; it
 hand loved best; hand would
 chosen, choose?’ tell be
 one amongst us?”
 
looked arthur. saw, too, did, infinite
 kindness suggested hand restore
 lucy us holy, unholy, memory; stepped forward and
 said bravely, though hand trembled, face pale as
 snow:--
 
“my true friend, bottom broken heart thank you. tell me
 do, shall falter!” helsing laid hand his
 shoulder, said:--
 
“brave lad! moment’s courage, done. stake must be
 driven her. will fearful ordeal--be deceived in
 that--but will short time, will rejoice more
 pain great; grim tomb will emerge though
 tread air. must falter begun. only
 think we, true friends, round you, pray for
 time.”
 
“go on,” said arthur hoarsely. “tell do.”
 
“take stake left hand, ready place point the
 heart, hammer right. begin prayer for
 dead--i shall read him, book, others shall
 follow--strike god’s name, may well dead that
 love un-dead pass away.”
 
arthur took stake hammer, mind set on
 action hands never trembled even quivered. helsing opened
 missal began read, quincey followed well we
 could. arthur placed point heart, looked could
 see dint white flesh. struck might.
 
thing coffin writhed; hideous, blood-curdling screech
 came opened red lips. body shook quivered twisted
 wild contortions; sharp white teeth champed together till the
 lips cut, mouth smeared crimson foam. arthur
 never faltered. looked like figure thor untrembling arm
 rose fell, driving deeper deeper mercy-bearing stake, whilst
 blood pierced heart welled spurted around it. his
 face set, high duty seemed shine it; sight it
 gave us courage voices seemed ring little
 vault.
 
writhing quivering body became less, the
 teeth seemed champ, face quiver. finally lay still. the
 terrible task over.
 
hammer fell arthur’s hand. reeled fallen had
 caught him. great drops sweat sprang forehead,
 breath came broken gasps. indeed awful strain
 him; forced task human
 considerations never gone it. few
 minutes taken look towards the
 coffin. did, however, murmur startled surprise ran one
 us. gazed eagerly arthur rose, had
 seated ground, came looked too; glad,
 strange light broke face dispelled altogether gloom of
 horror lay upon it.
 
there, coffin lay longer foul thing dreaded
 grown hate work destruction yielded a
 privilege one best entitled it, lucy seen in
 life, face unequalled sweetness purity. true that
 there, seen life, traces care and
 pain waste; dear us, marked truth
 knew. one felt holy calm lay like
 sunshine wasted face form earthly token and
 symbol calm reign ever.
 
helsing came laid hand arthur’s shoulder, said to
 him:--
 
“and now, arthur friend, dear lad, forgiven?”
 
reaction terrible strain came took old man’s hand
 his, raising lips, pressed it, said:--
 
“forgiven! god bless given dear one soul again,
 peace.” put hands professor’s shoulder, laying
 head breast, cried silently, whilst stood
 unmoving. raised head helsing said him:--
 
“and now, child, may kiss her. kiss dead lips will, as
 to, choose. grinning
 devil now--not foul thing eternity. longer is
 devil’s un-dead. god’s true dead, whose soul him!”
 
arthur bent kissed her, sent quincey the
 tomb; professor sawed top stake, leaving point
 body. cut head filled mouth with
 garlic. soldered leaden coffin, screwed coffin-lid,
 gathering belongings, came away. professor locked
 door gave key arthur.
 
outside air sweet, sun shone, birds sang, it
 seemed nature tuned different pitch. was
 gladness mirth peace everywhere, rest ourselves
 one account, glad, though tempered joy.
 
moved away helsing said:--
 
“now, friends, one step work done, one harrowing
 ourselves. remains greater task: find author
 sorrow stamp out. clues can
 follow; long task, difficult, danger in
 it, pain. shall help me? learned believe, all
 us--is so? since so, see duty? yes! do
 promise go bitter end?”
 
turn, took hand, promise made. said the
 professor moved off:--
 
“two nights hence shall meet dine together seven of
 clock friend john. shall entreat two others, two you
 know yet; shall ready work show plans
 unfold. friend john, come home, much consult
 about, can help me. to-night leave amsterdam, shall
 return to-morrow night. begins great quest. first i
 shall much say, may know dread.
 promise shall made anew; a
 terrible task us, feet ploughshare we
 must draw back.”

arrived berkeley hotel, helsing found telegram
 waiting him:--
 
“am coming train. jonathan whitby. important news.--mina

wire despatched cup tea; told of

crowd melted away, bustling fashion common arrival

 guest, sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped me, and,
 quick glance, said: “dr. seward, not?”
 
“and mrs. harker!” answered once; whereupon held out
 hand.
 
“i knew description poor dear lucy; but----” stopped
 suddenly, quick blush overspread face.
 
blush rose cheeks somehow set us ease, it

 unconscious simplicity, different voice, naïveté
 child: “that’s quite true, upon honour. honest indian!” could
 smile, grimaced. “i gave away time!” he
 said. “but know that, although kept diary months
 past, never struck going find particular

 made diary doctor attended lucy might have

 said boldly:--
 
“then, dr. seward, better let copy my

 everything carefully thought out, done systematically and
 precision. seemed prepared every obstacle which

 unable speak one, man must speak time of
 sorrow. woman whose sympathy given him, with
 whom, owing terrible circumstance sorrow was

_30 september._--i got home five o’clock, found godalming

 carriers’ men, dr. hennessey written me. mrs. harker gave
 us cup tea, can honestly say that, first time since i

“dr. seward, may ask favour? want see patient, mr.

 refuse her, possible reason should; so
 took me. went room, told man a
 lady like see him; simply answered: “why?”
 
“she going house, wants see every one it,” i
 answered. “oh, well,” said; “let come in, means; but
 just wait minute till tidy place.” method tidying was
 peculiar: simply swallowed flies spiders boxes

 held hand.
 
“good-evening, mr. renfield,” said she. “you see, know you, dr.
 seward told you.” made immediate reply, eyed all
 intently set frown face. look gave way one
 wonder, merged doubt; then, intense astonishment, he
 said:--
 
“you’re girl doctor wanted marry, you? can’t be,
 know, she’s dead.” mrs. harker smiled sweetly replied:--
 
“oh no! husband own, married ever
 saw dr. seward, me. mrs. harker.”
 
“then here?”
 
“my husband staying visit dr. seward.”
 
“then don’t stay.”
 
“but not?” thought style conversation might be
 pleasant mrs. harker, me, joined in:--
 
“how know wanted marry one?” reply simply
 contemptuous, given pause turned eyes mrs.
 harker me, instantly turning back again:--
 
“what asinine question!”
 
“i don’t see all, mr. renfield,” said mrs. harker, once
 championing me. replied much courtesy respect as
 shown contempt me:--
 
“you will, course, understand, mrs. harker, man so
 loved honoured host is, everything regarding of
 interest little community. dr. seward loved his
 household friends, even patients, who, of
 hardly mental equilibrium, apt distort causes and
 effects. since inmate lunatic asylum, i
 notice sophistic tendencies inmates
 lean towards errors _non causa_ _ignoratio elenchi_.” i
 positively opened eyes new development. pet

 with--talking elemental philosophy, manner polished

 way due unconscious influence, must rare gift or

continued talk time; and, seeing seemingly
 quite reasonable, ventured, looking questioningly she
 began, lead favourite topic. astonished, for
 addressed question impartiality the
 completest sanity; even took example mentioned
 certain things.
 
“why, instance man strange belief. indeed,

 either think say; hard imagine seen eat up
 spiders flies five minutes before. looking watch, i
 saw go station meet helsing, told mrs.
 harker time leave. came once, saying
 pleasantly mr. renfield: “good-bye, hope may see often,
 auspices pleasanter yourself,” which, astonishment, he
 replied:--
 
“good-bye, dear. pray god may never see sweet face again.
 may bless keep you!”
 
went station meet helsing left boys behind
 me. poor art seemed cheerful since lucy first took
 ill, quincey like bright self for
 many long day.
 
helsing stepped carriage eager nimbleness a
 boy. saw once, rushed me, saying:--
 
“ah, friend john, goes all? well? so! busy, come

 arthur friend quincey, you, too? good!”
 
drove house told passed, own

“ah, wonderful madam mina! man’s brain--a brain man

 come him. “oh known before!” said, “for we
 might reached time save poor lucy. however, ‘the milk
 spilt cries afterwards,’ say. shall think

 lasted till entered gateway. went prepare for
 dinner said mrs. harker:--
 
“i told, madam mina, friend john husband have
 put exact order things been, moment.”
 
“not moment, professor,” said impulsively, “but to

“but now? seen hitherto good light the
 little things made. told secrets, yet one who
 told worse it.”
 
mrs. harker began blush, taking paper pockets, she
 said:--
 
“dr. helsing, will read this, tell must go in. it

“it need go wish it; pray may. can

“count in, professor,” said mr. quincey morris, laconically usual.
 
“i you,” said lord godalming, “for lucy’s sake, other

dr. seward simply nodded. professor stood and, laying his

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_1 october, 4 a. m._--just leave house, an
 urgent message brought renfield know see

 told messenger say attend wishes the

“he seems importunate, sir. never seen eager. don’t

“take you, friend john,” said professor. “his case your

“may come also?” asked lord godalming.
 
“me too?” said quincey morris. “may come?” said harker. nodded, and
 went passage together.

 none others first said anything. request would

 introducing madman asylum strike moment; and,
 besides, certain dignity man’s manner, much of
 habit equality, made introduction: “lord
 godalming; professor helsing; mr. quincey morris, texas; mr.
 renfield.” shook hands them, saying turn:--
 
“lord godalming, honour seconding father the

 wanted cat; prepared see collapse same

“let entreat you, dr. seward, oh, let implore you, let out

jonathan harker’s journal
 

_1 october, evening._--i found thomas snelling house bethnal
 green, unhappily condition remember anything. the
 prospect beer expected coming opened had
 proved much, begun early expected debauch. i
 learned, however, wife, seemed decent, poor soul, he
 assistant smollet, two mates the
 responsible person. drove walworth, found mr. joseph
 smollet home shirtsleeves, taking late tea a
 saucer. decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly good, reliable
 type workman, headpiece own. remembered all
 incident boxes, wonderful dog’s-eared
 notebook, produced mysterious receptacle the
 seat trousers, hieroglyphical entries thick,
 half-obliterated pencil, gave destinations boxes. there
 were, said, six cartload took carfax left at
 197, chicksand street, mile end new town, another six he
 deposited jamaica lane, bermondsey. count meant to
 scatter ghastly refuges london, places were
 chosen first delivery, later might distribute more
 fully. systematic manner done made think that
 mean confine two sides london. now
 fixed far east northern shore, east southern
 shore, south. north west surely never meant to
 left diabolical scheme--let alone city the
 heart fashionable london south-west west. went back
 smollet, asked tell us boxes had
 taken carfax.
 
replied:--
 
“well, guv’nor, you’ve treated wery ’an’some”--i given half a
 sovereign--“an’ i’ll tell yer know. heard man name of
 bloxam say four nights ago ’are an’ ’ounds, pincher’s alley,
 ’ow an’ mate ’ad ’ad rare dusty job old ’ouse at
 purfect. ain’t a-many jobs ’ere, an’ i’m thinkin’
 maybe sam bloxam tell ye summut.” asked tell me
 find him. told get address it
 worth another half-sovereign him. gulped rest
 tea stood up, saying going begin search
 there. door stopped, said:--
 
“look ’ere, guv’nor, ain’t sense a-keepin’ ’ere. i
 may find sam soon, mayn’t; anyhow ain’t like way
 tell ye much to-night. sam rare one starts booze.
 can give envelope stamp it, put yer address on
 it, i’ll find sam found post ye to-night. but
 ye’d better arter ’im soon mornin’, maybe ye won’t ketch
 ’im; sam gets main early, never mind booze night afore.”
 
practical, one children went penny to
 buy envelope sheet paper, keep change. she
 came back, addressed envelope stamped it, smollet had
 faithfully promised post address found, took way
 home. we’re track anyhow. tired to-night, want sleep.
 mina fast asleep, looks little pale; eyes look as
 though crying. poor dear, i’ve doubt frets be
 kept dark, may make doubly anxious the
 others. best is. better disappointed and
 worried way now nerve broken. doctors
 quite right insist kept dreadful
 business. must firm, particular burden silence
 must rest. shall ever enter subject any
 circumstances. indeed, may hard task, all, she
 become reticent subject, spoken the
 count doings ever since told decision.
 
* * * * *
 
_2 october, evening._--a long trying exciting day. first
 post got directed envelope dirty scrap paper enclosed, on
 written carpenter’s pencil sprawling hand:--
 
“sam bloxam, korkrans, 4, poters cort, bartel street, walworth. arsk for
 depite.”
 
got letter bed, rose without waking mina. looked heavy
 sleepy pale, far well. determined wake her,
 that, return new search, arrange for
 going back exeter. think happier home,
 daily tasks interest her, amongst us and
 ignorance. saw dr. seward moment, told i
 to, promising come back tell rest soon should
 found anything. drove walworth found, some
 difficulty, potter’s court. mr. smollet’s spelling misled me, asked
 poter’s court instead potter’s court. however, found
 court, difficulty discovering corcoran’s lodging-house.
 asked man came door “depite,” shook his
 head, said: “i dunno ’im. ain’t person ’ere; never
 ’eard ’im bloomin’ days. don’t believe ain’t nobody
 kind livin’ ere anywheres.” took smollet’s letter, and
 read seemed lesson spelling name
 court might guide me. “what you?” asked.
 
“i’m depity,” answered. saw right
 track; phonetic spelling misled me. half-crown tip put the
 deputy’s knowledge disposal, learned mr. bloxam, who
 slept remains beer previous night at
 corcoran’s, left work poplar five o’clock that
 morning. tell place work situated, but
 vague idea kind “new-fangled ware’us”;
 slender clue start poplar. twelve
 o’clock got satisfactory hint building, this
 got coffee-shop, workmen dinner. one
 suggested erected cross angel street a
 new “cold storage” building; suited condition a
 “new-fangled ware’us,” drove it. interview surly
 gatekeeper surlier foreman, appeased the
 coin realm, put track bloxam; sent my
 suggesting willing pay day’s wages foreman for
 privilege asking questions private matter. was
 smart enough fellow, though rough speech bearing. had
 promised pay information given earnest, told me
 made two journeys carfax house piccadilly,
 taken house latter nine great boxes--“main
 heavy ones”--with horse cart hired purpose. i
 asked tell number house piccadilly, to
 replied:--
 
“well, guv’nor, forgits number, doors a
 big white church somethink kind, long built. a
 dusty old ’ouse, too, though nothin’ dustiness ’ouse we
 tooked bloomin’ boxes from.”
 
“how get houses empty?”
 
“there old party engaged a-waitin’ ’ouse at
 purfleet. ’elped lift boxes put dray. curse
 me, strongest chap ever struck, an’ old feller,
 white moustache, one thin think couldn’t throw
 shadder.”
 
phrase thrilled me!
 
“why, ’e took ’is end o’ boxes like pounds tea, and
 a-puffin’ an’ a-blowin’ afore up-end mine anyhow--an’ i’m no
 chicken, neither.”
 
“how get house piccadilly?” asked.
 
“he too. must ’a’ started got afore me, for
 rung bell kem an’ opened door ’isself an’ ’elped me
 carry boxes ’all.”
 
“the whole nine?” asked.
 
“yus; five first load an’ four second. was
 main dry work, an’ don’t well remember ’ow got ’ome.” i
 interrupted him:--
 
“were boxes left hall?”
 
“yus; big ’all, an’ nothin’ else it.” made one
 attempt matters:--
 
“you didn’t key?”
 
“never used key nothink. old gent, opened door ’isself
 an’ shut druv off. don’t remember last time--but
 beer.”
 
“and can’t remember number house?”
 
“no, sir. ye needn’t difficulty that. it’s ’igh ’un
 stone front bow it, an’ ’igh steps door. i
 know steps, ’avin’ ’ad carry boxes three loafers
 come round earn copper. old gent give shillin’s, an’
 seein’ got much, wanted more; ’e took one them
 shoulder like throw ’im steps, till lot
 went away cussin’.” thought description could
 find house, so, paid friend information, started
 piccadilly. gained new painful experience; count
 could, evident, handle earth-boxes himself. so, time was
 precious; for, now achieved certain amount of
 distribution, could, choosing time, complete task
 unobserved. piccadilly circus discharged cab, walked
 westward; beyond junior constitutional came across house
 described, satisfied next lairs
 arranged dracula. house looked though long
 untenanted. windows encrusted dust, shutters were
 up. framework black time, iron paint

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_1 october._--i puzzled afresh renfield. moods change so
 rapidly find difficult keep touch them, they
 always mean something well-being, form more
 interesting study. morning, went see his
 repulse helsing, manner man commanding destiny.
 was, fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. really
 care things mere earth; clouds and
 looked weaknesses wants us poor mortals. i
 thought improve occasion learn something, asked
 him:--
 
“what flies times?” smiled quite superior
 sort way--such smile become face malvolio--as
 answered me:--
 
“the fly, dear sir, one striking feature; wings typical
 aërial powers psychic faculties. ancients well
 typified soul butterfly!”
 
thought push analogy utmost logically, said
 quickly:--
 
“oh, soul now, it?” madness foiled his
 reason, puzzled look spread face as, shaking head
 decision seldom seen him, said:--
 
“oh, no, oh no! want souls. life want.” brightened
 up; “i pretty indifferent present. life right; i
 want. must get new patient, doctor, wish to
 study zoöphagy!”
 
puzzled little, drew on:--
 
“then command life; god, suppose?” smiled an
 ineffably benign superiority.
 
“oh no! far arrogate attributes the
 deity. even concerned especially spiritual doings. i
 may state intellectual position am, far concerns things
 purely terrestrial, somewhat position enoch occupied
 spiritually!” poser me. moment recall
 enoch’s appositeness; ask simple question, though felt
 lowering eyes lunatic:--
 
“and enoch?”
 
“because walked god.” see analogy, not
 like admit it; harked back denied:--
 
“so don’t care life don’t want souls. not?” put
 question quickly somewhat sternly, purpose disconcert him.
 effort succeeded; instant unconsciously relapsed his
 old servile manner, bent low me, actually fawned upon as
 replied:--
 
“i don’t want souls, indeed, indeed! don’t. couldn’t use if
 them; manner use me. couldn’t eat them
 or----” suddenly stopped old cunning look spread his
 face, like wind-sweep surface water. “and doctor, to
 life, all? you’ve got require, you
 know will never want, all. friends--good
 friends--like you, dr. seward”; said leer of
 inexpressible cunning. “i know shall never lack means of

“i don’t want souls!” said feeble, apologetic way. the
 matter seemed preying mind, determined use it--to “be
 cruel kind.” said:--
 
“you like life, want life?”
 
“oh yes! right; needn’t worry that!”
 
“but,” asked, “how get life without getting soul
 also?” seemed puzzle him, followed up:--
 
“a nice time you’ll time you’re flying there, with

“not much! flies poor things, all!” pause added,
 “but don’t want souls buzzing round me, same.”
 
“or spiders?” went on.
 
“blow spiders! what’s use spiders? isn’t anything them
 eat or”--he stopped suddenly, though reminded forbidden
 topic.
 
“so, so!” thought myself, “this second time suddenly
 stopped word ‘drink’; mean?” renfield seemed himself
 aware made lapse, hurried on, though distract
 attention it:--
 
“i don’t take stock matters. ‘rats mice such

“i see,” said. “you want big things can make teeth meet

“i don’t want elephant’s soul, soul all!” said. a

dr. seward’s diary
 

_3 october._--let put exactness happened, well
 can remember it, since last made entry. detail i
 can recall must forgotten; calmness must proceed.
 
came renfield’s room found lying floor his
 left side glittering pool blood. went move him, it
 became apparent received terrible injuries;
 seemed none unity purpose parts body
 marks even lethargic sanity. face exposed see
 horribly bruised, though beaten the
 floor--indeed face wounds pool blood
 originated. attendant kneeling beside body said as
 turned over:--
 
“i think, sir, back broken. see, right arm leg and
 whole side face paralysed.” thing have
 happened puzzled attendant beyond measure. seemed quite
 bewildered, brows gathered said:--
 
“i can’t understand two things. mark face like by
 beating head floor. saw young woman the
 eversfield asylum anyone lay hands her. suppose he
 might broke neck falling bed, got awkward
 kink. life can’t imagine two things
 occurred. back broke, couldn’t beat head; his
 face like fall bed, marks of
 it.” said him:--
 
“go dr. helsing, ask kindly come once. want
 without instant’s delay.” man ran off, within few
 minutes professor, dressing gown slippers, appeared. when
 saw renfield ground, looked keenly moment, and
 turned me. think recognised thought eyes, he
 said quietly, manifestly ears attendant:--
 
“ah, sad accident! will need careful watching, much
 attention. shall stay myself; shall first dress myself.
 will remain shall minutes join you.”
 
patient now breathing stertorously easy see that
 suffered terrible injury. helsing returned with
 extraordinary celerity, bearing surgical case. had
 evidently thinking mind made up; for, almost he
 looked patient, whispered me:--
 
“send attendant away. must alone becomes
 conscious, operation.” said:--
 
“i think will now, simmons. done can at
 present. better go round, dr. helsing will operate.
 let know instantly anything unusual anywhere.”
 
man withdrew, went strict examination patient.
 wounds face superficial; real injury depressed
 fracture skull, extending right motor area. the
 professor thought moment said:--
 
“we must reduce pressure get back normal conditions, far
 can be; rapidity suffusion shows terrible nature of
 injury. whole motor area seems affected. suffusion the
 brain will increase quickly, must trephine may be
 late.” speaking soft tapping door. i
 went opened found corridor without, arthur and
 quincey pajamas slippers: former spoke:--
 
“i heard man call dr. helsing tell accident.
 woke quincey rather called asleep. things
 moving quickly strangely sound sleep us
 times. i’ve thinking to-morrow night will see things
 been. we’ll look back--and forward little more
 done. may come in?” nodded, held door open
 till entered; closed again. quincey saw the
 attitude state patient, noted horrible pool the
 floor, said softly:--
 
“my god! happened him? poor, poor devil!” told him
 briefly, added expected recover consciousness after
 operation--for short time, events. went sat
 edge bed, godalming beside him; watched
 patience.
 
“we shall wait,” said helsing, “just long enough fix best
 spot trephining, may quickly perfectly remove
 blood clot; evident hæmorrhage increasing.”
 
minutes waited passed fearful slowness. a
 horrible sinking heart, helsing’s face gathered
 felt fear apprehension come. dreaded
 words renfield might speak. positively afraid think;
 conviction coming me, read men
 heard death-watch. poor man’s breathing came in
 uncertain gasps. instant seemed though open eyes
 speak; follow prolonged stertorous breath, he
 relapse fixed insensibility. inured sick
 beds death, suspense grew, grew upon me. almost
 hear beating heart; blood surging my
 temples sounded like blows hammer. silence finally became
 agonising. looked companions, one another, saw from
 flushed faces damp brows enduring equal
 torture. nervous suspense us all, though overhead
 dread bell peal powerfully least expect
 it.
 
last came time evident patient was
 sinking fast; might die moment. looked professor
 caught eyes fixed mine. face sternly set he
 spoke:--
 
“there time lose. words may worth many lives; have
 thinking so, stood here. may soul stake!
 shall operate just ear.”
 
without another word made operation. moments the
 breathing continued stertorous. came breath so
 prolonged seemed though tear open chest.
 suddenly eyes opened, became fixed wild, helpless stare.
 continued moments; softened glad
 surprise, lips came sigh relief. moved
 convulsively, so, said:--
 
“i’ll quiet, doctor. tell take strait-waistcoat. i
 terrible dream, left weak cannot
 move. what’s wrong face? feels swollen, smarts
 dreadfully.” tried turn head; even effort his
 eyes seemed grow glassy gently put back. van
 helsing said quiet grave tone:--
 
“tell us dream, mr. renfield.” heard voice face
 brightened, mutilation, said:--
 
“that dr. helsing. good here. give some
 water, lips dry; shall try tell you. dreamed”--he
 stopped seemed fainting, called quietly quincey--“the
 brandy--it study--quick!” flew returned glass,
 decanter brandy carafe water. moistened parched
 lips, patient quickly revived. seemed, however, poor
 injured brain working interval, for, quite
 conscious, looked piercingly agonised confusion i
 shall never forget, said:--
 
“i must deceive myself; dream, grim reality.”
 eyes roved round room; caught sight two
 figures sitting patiently edge bed went on:--
 
“if sure already, know them.” instant his
 eyes closed--not pain sleep voluntarily, though were
 bringing faculties bear; opened said,
 hurriedly, energy yet displayed:--
 
“quick, doctor, quick. dying! feel minutes;
 must go back death--or worse! wet lips brandy
 again. something must say die; poor
 crushed brain dies anyhow. thank you! night left
 me, implored let go away. couldn’t speak then, i
 felt tongue tied; sane then, except way, as
 now. agony despair long time left
 me; seemed hours. came sudden peace me. brain
 seemed become cool again, realised was. heard the
 dogs bark behind house, was!” spoke, van
 helsing’s eyes never blinked, hand came met mine and
 gripped hard. not, however, betray himself; nodded slightly
 said: “go on,” low voice. renfield proceeded:--
 
“he came window mist, seen often before;
 solid then--not ghost, eyes fierce like a
 man’s angry. laughing red mouth; sharp white
 teeth glinted moonlight turned look back belt
 trees, dogs barking. wouldn’t ask come in
 first, though knew wanted to--just wanted along.
 began promising things--not words them.” he
 interrupted word professor:--
 
“how?”
 
“by making happen; just used send flies the
 sun shining. great big fat ones steel sapphire their
 wings; big moths, night, skull cross-bones their
 backs.” helsing nodded whispered unconsciously:--
 
“the _acherontia aitetropos sphinges_--what call the
 ‘death’s-head moth’?” patient went without stopping.
 
“then began whisper: ‘rats, rats, rats! hundreds, thousands,
 millions them, every one life; dogs eat them, cats
 too. lives! red blood, years life it; merely
 buzzing flies!’ laughed him, wanted see do.
 dogs howled, away beyond dark trees house. he
 beckoned window. got looked out, raised his
 hands, seemed call without using words. dark mass
 spread grass, coming like shape flame fire; and
 moved mist right left, see there
 thousands rats eyes blazing red--like his, only
 smaller. held hand, stopped; thought he
 seemed saying: ‘all lives will give you, ay, many more
 greater, countless ages, will fall worship
 me!’ red cloud, like colour blood, seemed close
 eyes; knew doing, found opening
 sash saying him: ‘come in, lord master!’ rats were
 gone, slid room sash, though only
 open inch wide--just moon often come through
 tiniest crack stood size and
 splendour.”
 
voice weaker, moistened lips brandy again, and
 continued; seemed though memory gone working in
 interval story advanced. call him
 back point, helsing whispered me: “let go on. do
 interrupt him; go back, maybe proceed all
 lost thread thought.” proceeded:--
 
“all day waited hear him, send anything, not
 even blow-fly, moon got pretty angry him.
 slid window, though shut, even
 knock, got mad him. sneered me, white face looked
 mist red eyes gleaming, went though he
 owned whole place, one. didn’t even smell same
 went me. couldn’t hold him. thought that, somehow, mrs.
 harker come room.”
 
two men sitting bed stood came over, standing behind
 see them, hear better.
 silent, professor started quivered; face,
 however, grew grimmer sterner still. renfield went without
 noticing:--
 
“when mrs. harker came see afternoon wasn’t same;
 like tea teapot watered.” moved,
 one said word; went on:--
 
“i didn’t know till spoke; didn’t look the
 same. don’t care pale people; like lots blood
 them, seemed run out. didn’t think it
 time; went away began think, made mad
 know taking life her.” feel that
 rest quivered, did, remained otherwise still. “so when
 came to-night ready him. saw mist stealing in, i
 grabbed tight. heard madmen unnatural strength; and
 knew madman--at times anyhow--i resolved use power.
 ay, felt too, come mist struggle
 me. held tight; thought going win, didn’t
 mean take life, till saw eyes. burned
 me, strength became like water. slipped it, and
 tried cling him, raised flung down. there
 red cloud me, noise like thunder, mist seemed
 steal away door.” voice becoming fainter his
 breath stertorous. helsing stood instinctively.
 
“we know worst now,” said. “he here, know purpose.
 may late. let us armed--the other
 night, lose time; instant spare.” no
 need put fear, nay conviction, words--we shared in
 common. hurried took rooms things we
 entered count’s house. professor ready, and
 met corridor pointed significantly said:--
 
“they never leave me; shall till unhappy business is
 over. wise also, friends. common enemy deal with.
 alas! alas! dear madam mina suffer!” stopped; his
 voice breaking, know rage terror predominated in
 heart.
 
outside harkers’ door paused. art quincey held back, the
 latter said:--
 
“should disturb her?”
 
“we must,” said helsing grimly. “if door locked, shall
 break in.”
 
“may frighten terribly? unusual break lady’s
 room!”
 
helsing said solemnly, “you always right; life and
 death. chambers alike doctor; even they
 one to-night. friend john, turn handle, if
 door open, put shoulder shove; you
 too, friends. now!”
 
turned handle spoke, door yield. threw
 it; crash burst open, almost fell
 headlong room. professor actually fall, saw
 across gathered hands knees. saw
 appalled me. felt hair rise like bristles back neck,
 heart seemed stand still.
 
moonlight bright thick yellow blind room
 light enough see. bed beside window lay jonathan
 harker, face flushed breathing heavily though stupor.
 kneeling near edge bed facing outwards white-clad
 figure wife. side stood tall, thin man, clad black.
 face turned us, instant saw recognised
 count--in every way, even scar forehead. left
 hand held mrs. harker’s hands, keeping away arms
 full tension; right hand gripped back neck,
 forcing face bosom. white nightdress smeared
 blood, thin stream trickled man’s bare breast which
 shown torn-open dress. attitude two terrible
 resemblance child forcing kitten’s nose saucer milk to
 compel drink. burst room, count turned his
 face, hellish look heard described seemed leap
 it. eyes flamed red devilish passion; great nostrils
 white aquiline nose opened wide quivered edge; the
 white sharp teeth, behind full lips blood-dripping mouth,
 champed together like wild beast. wrench, threw
 victim back upon bed though hurled height, turned
 sprang us. time professor gained feet,
 holding towards envelope contained sacred
 wafer. count suddenly stopped, just poor lucy done outside
 tomb, cowered back. back cowered, we,
 lifting crucifixes, advanced. moonlight suddenly failed, a
 great black cloud sailed across sky; gaslight sprang up
 quincey’s match, saw nothing faint vapour. this, we
 looked, trailed door, recoil bursting
 open, swung back old position. helsing, art, moved
 forward mrs. harker, time drawn breath with
 given scream wild, ear-piercing, despairing it
 seems now will ring ears till dying day. a
 seconds lay helpless attitude disarray. face was
 ghastly, pallor accentuated blood smeared
 lips cheeks chin; throat trickled thin stream of
 blood; eyes mad terror. put face her
 poor crushed hands, bore whiteness red mark the
 count’s terrible grip, behind came low desolate wail
 made terrible scream seem quick expression an
 endless grief. helsing stepped forward drew coverlet gently
 body, whilst art, looking face instant
 despairingly, ran room. helsing whispered me:--
 
“jonathan stupor know vampire can produce. can
 nothing poor madam mina moments till recovers
 herself; must wake him!” dipped end towel cold water
 began flick face, wife while
 holding face hands sobbing way was
 heart-breaking hear. raised blind, looked the
 window. much moonshine; looked see quincey
 morris run across lawn hide shadow great
 yew-tree. puzzled think this; the
 instant heard harker’s quick exclamation woke partial
 consciousness, turned bed. face, might well
 be, look wild amazement. seemed dazed seconds, and
 full consciousness seemed burst upon once, he
 started up. wife aroused quick movement, turned to
 arms stretched out, though embrace him; instantly,
 however, drew again, putting elbows together, held
 hands face, shuddered till bed beneath shook.
 
“in god’s name mean?” harker cried out. “dr. seward, dr.
 helsing, it? happened? wrong? mina, dear,
 it? blood mean? god, god! come to
 this!” and, raising knees, beat hands wildly
 together. “good god help us! help her! oh, help her!” quick
 movement jumped bed, began pull clothes,--all the
 man awake need instant exertion. “what happened?
 tell it!” cried without pausing. “dr. helsing, you
 love mina, know. oh, something save her. gone too
 far yet. guard look _him_!” wife, terror
 horror distress, saw sure danger him: instantly
 forgetting grief, seized hold cried out:--
 
“no! no! jonathan, must leave me. suffered enough
 to-night, god knows, without dread harming you. must stay
 me. stay friends will watch you!” her
 expression became frantic spoke; and, yielding her, she
 pulled sitting bed side, clung fiercely.
 
helsing tried calm both. professor held his
 little golden crucifix, said wonderful calmness:--
 
“do fear, dear. here; whilst close no
 foul thing can approach. safe to-night; must calm
 take counsel together.” shuddered silent, holding down
 head husband’s breast. raised it, white
 night-robe stained blood lips touched, where
 thin open wound neck sent forth drops. instant she
 saw drew back, low wail, whispered, amidst choking
 sobs:--
 
“unclean, unclean! must touch kiss more. oh, it
 now worst enemy, may have
 cause fear.” spoke resolutely:--
 
“nonsense, mina. shame hear word. not
 hear you; shall hear you. may god judge my
 deserts, punish bitter suffering even hour,
 act will mine anything ever come us!” put out
 arms folded breast; lay there
 sobbing. looked us bowed head, eyes blinked
 damply quivering nostrils; mouth set steel. a
 sobs became less frequent faint, said to
 me, speaking studied calmness felt tried nervous
 power utmost:--
 
“and now, dr. seward, tell it. well know broad
 fact; tell been.” told exactly happened,
 listened seeming impassiveness; nostrils twitched
 eyes blazed told ruthless hands count had
 held wife terrible horrid position, mouth to
 open wound breast. interested me, even moment, to
 see, that, whilst face white set passion worked convulsively over
 bowed head, hands tenderly lovingly stroked ruffled
 hair. just finished, quincey godalming knocked door.

 questioningly. understood mean take advantage of
 coming divert possible thoughts unhappy husband
 wife themselves; nodding acquiescence
 asked seen done. lord godalming
 answered:--
 
“i see anywhere passage, rooms. i

 bed. helsing said gravely:--
 
“go on, friend arthur. want concealments. hope now

 moistening lips tongue, added: “except poor fellow

 us said solemnly:--
 
“god’s will done!” feel art keeping back
 something; but, took purpose, said nothing.
 helsing turned morris asked:--
 
“and you, friend quincey, tell?”
 
“a little,” answered. “it may much eventually, present i

said latter words shut teeth. space perhaps

 hand tenderly mrs. harker’s head:--
 
“and now, madam mina--poor, dear, dear madam mina--tell us exactly what

jonathan harker’s journal
 

_3 october._--as must something go mad, write diary. it
 now six o’clock, meet study half hour and
 take something eat; dr. helsing dr. seward agreed
 eat work best. best will be, god
 knows, required to-day. must keep writing every chance, dare
 stop think. all, big little, must go down; perhaps end
 little things may teach us most. teaching, big little, could
 landed mina anywhere worse to-day. however,
 must trust hope. poor mina told just now, tears
 running dear cheeks, trouble trial our
 faith tested--that must keep trusting; god will aid us
 end. end! oh god! end?... work! work!
 
dr. helsing dr. seward come back seeing poor
 renfield, went gravely done. first, dr. seward
 told us dr. helsing gone room below
 found renfield lying floor, heap. face was
 bruised crushed in, bones neck broken.
 
dr. seward asked attendant duty passage had
 heard anything. said sitting down--he confessed to
 half dozing--when heard loud voices room, renfield
 called loudly several times, “god! god! god!” there
 sound falling, entered room found lying
 floor, face down, just doctors seen him. helsing
 asked heard “voices” “a voice,” said not
 say; first seemed two, as
 one room one. swear
 it, required, word “god” spoken patient. dr.
 seward said us, alone, wish go into
 matter; question inquest considered, it
 never put forward truth, one believe it. as
 was, thought attendant’s evidence give a
 certificate death misadventure falling bed. case the
 coroner demand it, formal inquest, necessarily
 result.
 
question began discussed next
 step, first thing decided mina full
 confidence; nothing sort--no matter painful--should be
 kept her. agreed wisdom, pitiful
 see brave yet sorrowful, depth of
 despair. “there must concealment,” said, “alas! had
 much already. besides nothing world can
 give pain already endured--than suffer now!
 whatever may happen, must new hope new courage me!”
 helsing looking fixedly spoke, said, suddenly
 quietly:--
 
“but dear madam mina, afraid; yourself, for
 others yourself, happened?” face grew set its
 lines, eyes shone devotion martyr she
 answered:--
 
“ah no! mind made up!”
 
“to what?” asked gently, whilst still; in
 way sort vague idea meant. answer
 came direct simplicity, though simply stating fact:--
 
“because find myself--and shall watch keenly it--a sign of
 harm love, shall die!”
 
“you kill yourself?” asked, hoarsely.
 
“i would; friend loved me, save a
 pain, desperate effort!” looked meaningly she
 spoke. sitting down; now rose came close and
 put hand head said solemnly:
 
“my child, one good. i
 hold account god find euthanasia you,
 even moment best. nay, safe! my
 child----” moment seemed choked, great sob rose his
 throat; gulped went on:--
 
“there stand death. must not
 die. must die hand; least own. until
 other, fouled sweet life, true dead must not
 die; still quick un-dead, death make
 even is. no, must live! must struggle strive to
 live, though death seem boon unspeakable. must fight death
 himself, though come pain joy; day, the
 night; safety peril! living soul charge you
 die--nay, think death--till great evil past.” the
 poor dear grew white death, shock shivered, seen a
 quicksand shake shiver incoming tide. all
 silent; nothing. length grew calm turning to
 said, sweetly, oh! sorrowfully, held hand:--
 
“i promise you, dear friend, god will let live, shall
 strive so; till, may good time, horror may

 hearts strengthened work endure her, we
 began discuss do. told all
 papers safe, papers diaries phonographs we
 might hereafter use; keep record done before.

usual helsing thought ahead everyone else, was
 prepared exact ordering work.
 
“it perhaps well,” said, “that meeting visit to
 carfax decided anything earth-boxes lay
 there. done so, count must guessed purpose, and
 doubtless taken measures advance frustrate an

 contain thought minutes seconds so
 preciously laden mina’s life happiness flying us,
 since whilst talked action impossible. helsing held up
 hand warningly. “nay, friend jonathan,” said, “in this, the
 quickest way home longest way, proverb say. shall all

“then let us come once,” cried, “we wasting precious,

“and get house piccadilly?”
 
“any way!” cried. “we shall break need be.”
 
“and police; will be, will say?”
 
staggered; knew wished delay good
 reason it. said, quietly could:--
 
“don’t wait need be; know, sure, torture am
 in.”
 
“ah, child, do; indeed wish add to
 anguish. just think, can do, world at

 seems simplest way best all. now wish get

“now suppose were, truth, owner house, could
 still get in; think conscience the
 housebreaker, do?”
 
“i get respectable locksmith, set work pick the
 lock me.”
 
“and police, interfere, not?”
 
“oh, no! knew man properly employed.”
 
“then,” looked keenly spoke, “all doubt is
 conscience employer, belief policemen to
 whether employer good conscience bad one. your
 police must indeed zealous men clever--oh, clever!--in reading

see right terrible despair mina’s
 face became relaxed thought; hope good counsel. van
 helsing went on:--
 
“when within house may find clues; rate of
 us can remain whilst rest find places be
 earth-boxes--at bermondsey mile end.”
 
lord godalming stood up. “i can use here,” said. “i shall

“friend quincey right!” said professor. “his head you

mina took growing interest everything rejoiced see

 ghastly, thin lips drawn away, showing teeth in

 finally agreed starting piccadilly destroy the

 thus still ahead work destruction; his
 presence purely material shape, weakest, might give us
 new clue.
 
disposal forces, suggested professor that,
 visit carfax, enter house piccadilly;
 two doctors remain there, whilst lord godalming
 quincey found lairs walworth mile end destroyed them.
 possible, likely, professor urged, count
 might appear piccadilly day, might be
 able cope there. rate, might able to
 follow force. plan strenuously objected, far as
 going concerned, said intended stay protect
 mina, thought mind made subject; mina would
 listen objection. said might law matter

 that, was, strength muster required to
 cope count’s extraordinary power. give in, mina’s
 resolution fixed; said last hope _her_ that
 work together. “as me,” said, “i fear.
 things bad can be; whatever may happen must
 element hope comfort. go, husband! god can, if
 wishes it, guard well alone one present.” i
 started crying out: “then god’s name let us come once, we
 losing time. count may come piccadilly earlier we
 think.”
 
“not so!” said helsing, holding hand.
 
“but why?” asked.
 
“do forget,” said, actually smile, “that last night he
 banqueted heavily, will sleep late?”
 
forget! shall ever--can ever! can us ever forget that
 terrible scene! mina struggled hard keep brave countenance; but
 pain overmastered put hands face, and
 shuddered whilst moaned. helsing intended recall her
 frightful experience. simply lost sight part in
 affair intellectual effort. struck said,
 horrified thoughtlessness tried comfort her. “oh,
 madam mina,” said, “dear, dear madam mina, alas! so
 reverence said anything forgetful. stupid old
 lips mine stupid old head deserve so; will
 forget it, will not?” bent low beside spoke; took
 hand, looking tears, said hoarsely:--
 
“no, shall forget, well remember; i

 must eat may strong.”
 
breakfast strange meal us all. tried cheerful and
 encourage other, mina brightest cheerful of

“now, dear friends, go forth terrible enterprise. we

 him. “then well. now, madam mina, case _quite_ safe

fearful scream almost froze hearts hear. he
 placed wafer mina’s forehead, seared it--had burned
 flesh though piece white-hot metal. poor
 darling’s brain told significance fact quickly as
 nerves received pain it; two overwhelmed that
 overwrought nature voice dreadful scream. the
 words thought came quickly; echo scream ceased
 ring air came reaction, sank her
 knees floor agony abasement. pulling beautiful hair
 face, leper old mantle, wailed out:--
 
“unclean! unclean! even almighty shuns polluted flesh! must
 bear mark shame upon forehead judgment day.” they
 paused. thrown beside agony helpless
 grief, putting arms around held tight. minutes our
 sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst friends around us turned away
 eyes ran tears silently. helsing turned said
 gravely; gravely help feeling some
 way inspired, stating things outside himself:--
 
“it may may bear mark till god see fit,
 surely shall, judgment day, redress wrongs of

hope words, comfort; made resignation.
 mina felt so, simultaneously took one old

dr. seward’s diary
 

_3 october._--the time seemed terribly long whilst waiting for
 coming godalming quincey morris. professor tried keep
 minds active using time. see beneficent
 purpose, side glances threw time time harker.
 poor fellow overwhelmed misery appalling see.
 last night frank, happy-looking man, strong, youthful
 face, full energy, dark brown hair. to-day drawn,
 haggard old man, whose white hair matches well hollow burning
 eyes grief-written lines face. energy still intact; in
 fact, like living flame. may yet salvation, for, if
 go well, will tide despairing period; will then,
 kind way, wake realities life. poor fellow, i
 thought trouble bad enough, his----! professor knows
 well enough, best keep mind active. he
 saying was, circumstances, absorbing interest. so
 well can remember, is:--
 
“i studied, since came hands, all
 papers relating monster; studied, the
 greater seems necessity utterly stamp out. there
 signs advance; power, knowledge of
 it. learned researches friend arminus buda-pesth,
 life wonderful man. soldier, statesman, and
 alchemist--which latter highest development the
 science-knowledge time. mighty brain, learning beyond
 compare, heart knew fear remorse. dared even to
 attend scholomance, branch knowledge time
 essay. well, brain powers survived the
 physical death; though seem memory complete.
 faculties mind been, is, child; is
 growing, things childish first now of
 man’s stature. experimenting, well; not
 crossed path yet--he may yet we
 fail--the father furtherer new order beings, whose road must
 lead death, life.”
 
harker groaned said, “and arrayed darling!
 experimenting? knowledge may help us defeat him!”
 
“he along, since coming, trying power, slowly but
 surely; big child-brain working. well us, is, as
 yet, child-brain; dared, first, attempt certain
 things long ago beyond power. however, means
 succeed, man centuries can afford wait
 go slow. _festina lente_ may well motto.”
 
“i fail understand,” said harker wearily. “oh, plain to
 me! perhaps grief trouble dulling brain.”
 
professor laid hand tenderly shoulder spoke:--
 
“ah, child, will plain. see how, late, this
 monster creeping knowledge experimentally. been
 making use zoöphagous patient effect entry friend
 john’s home; vampire, though afterwards can come when
 will, must first make entry asked thereto by
 inmate. important experiments. not
 see first great boxes moved others. he
 knew must so. time great
 child-brain growing, began consider whether he
 might move box. began help; then, he
 found all-right, try move alone. he
 progress, scatter graves him; none know where
 hidden. may intend bury deep ground. so
 use night, time can change his
 form, equal well; none may know his
 hiding-place! but, child, despair; knowledge come him
 just late! already lairs one sterilise him;
 sunset shall so. place he
 can move hide. delayed morning might sure. is
 stake us him? even
 careful him? clock one hour already, be
 well, friend arthur quincey way us. to-day our
 day, must go sure, slow, lose chance. see! are
 five us absent ones return.”
 
whilst speaking startled knock hall door, the
 double postman’s knock telegraph boy. moved the
 hall one impulse, helsing, holding hand us to
 keep silence, stepped door opened it. boy handed a
 despatch. professor closed door again, and, looking the
 direction, opened read aloud.
 
“look d. just now, 12:45, come carfax hurriedly and
 hastened towards south. seems going round may want
 see you: mina.”
 
pause, broken jonathan harker’s voice:--
 
“now, god thanked, shall soon meet!” helsing turned him
 quickly said:--
 
“god will act way time. fear, rejoice
 yet; wish moment may undoings.”
 
“i care nothing now,” answered hotly, “except wipe this
 brute face creation. sell soul it!”
 
“oh, hush, hush, child!” said helsing. “god purchase
 souls wise; devil, though may purchase, keep
 faith. god merciful just, knows pain your
 devotion dear madam mina. think you, pain be
 doubled, hear wild words. fear us, are
 devoted cause, to-day shall see end. time is
 coming action; to-day vampire limit powers man,
 till sunset may change. will take time arrive
 here--see, twenty minutes past one--and yet times
 can hither come, never quick. must hope for
 lord arthur quincey arrive first.”
 
half hour received mrs. harker’s telegram, there
 came quiet, resolute knock hall door. just ordinary
 knock, given hourly thousands gentlemen, made
 professor’s heart mine beat loudly. looked other, and
 together moved hall; held ready use various
 armaments--the spiritual left hand, mortal right. van
 helsing pulled back latch, and, holding door half open, stood
 back, hands ready action. gladness hearts
 must shown upon faces step, close door, we
 saw lord godalming quincey morris. came quickly closed
 door behind them, former saying, moved along the
 hall:--
 
“it right. found places; six boxes we
 destroyed all!”
 
“destroyed?” asked professor.
 
“for him!” silent minute, quincey said:--
 
“there’s nothing wait here. if, however, doesn’t turn up
 five o’clock, must start off; won’t leave mrs. harker
 alone sunset.”
 
“he will long now,” said helsing, been
 consulting pocket-book. “_nota bene_, madam’s telegram went
 south carfax, means went cross river, could
 slack tide, something one
 o’clock. went south meaning us. yet only
 suspicious; went carfax first place would
 suspect interference least. must bermondsey a
 short time him. already shows went to
 mile end next. took time; be
 carried river way. believe me, friends, shall not
 long wait now. ready plan attack, that
 may throw away chance. hush, time now. your
 arms! ready!” held warning hand spoke, could
 hear key softly inserted lock hall door.
 
admire, even moment, way a
 dominant spirit asserted itself. hunting parties and
 adventures different parts world, quincey morris always
 one arrange plan action, arthur been
 accustomed obey implicitly. now, old habit seemed be
 renewed instinctively. swift glance around room, once
 laid plan attack, and, without speaking word, a
 gesture, placed us position. helsing, harker, were
 just behind door, opened professor could
 guard whilst two stepped incomer door.
 godalming behind quincey front stood just sight ready to
 move front window. waited suspense made the
 seconds pass nightmare slowness. slow, careful steps came along
 hall; count evidently prepared surprise--at least
 feared it.
 
suddenly single bound leaped room, winning way past
 us us raise hand stay him. something
 panther-like movement--something unhuman, seemed
 sober us shock coming. first act was
 harker, who, quick movement, threw door
 leading room front house. count saw us, a
 horrible sort snarl passed face, showing eye-teeth long
 pointed; evil smile quickly passed cold stare of
 lion-like disdain. expression changed as, single
 impulse, advanced upon him. pity some
 better organised plan attack, even moment wondered what
 do. know whether lethal weapons would
 avail us anything. harker evidently meant try matter, had
 ready great kukri knife made fierce sudden cut him. the
 blow powerful one; diabolical quickness count’s
 leap back saved him. second less trenchant blade shorne

“as knew wanted get back transylvania, felt sure that

“no one knew went ‘or bloomin’ well cared,’ said, for
 something else think of--well blood again; soon
 became apparent _czarina catherine_ sail as
 expected. thin mist began creep river, grew,

 asked see box stowed. captain replied

 went ebb tide; doubtless morning far the

“and so, dear madam mina, rest time, for

_later._--when professor came in, talked state of
 things. see something mind wanted to
 say, felt hesitancy broaching subject. beating
 bush little, said suddenly:--
 
“friend john, something must talk alone, just
 first rate. later, may take others our
 confidence”; stopped, waited; went on:--
 
“madam mina, poor, dear madam mina changing.” cold shiver ran
 find worst fears thus endorsed. helsing
 continued:--

_later._--at outset meeting great personal relief was
 experienced helsing myself. mrs. harker sent a
 message husband say join us present, as
 thought better free discuss movements
 without presence embarrass us. professor looked each
 instant, somehow seemed relieved. own
 part, thought mrs. harker realised danger herself, was
 much pain well much danger averted. circumstances we
 agreed, questioning look answer, finger lip, to
 preserve silence suspicions, able to
 confer alone again. went plan campaign. van
 helsing roughly put facts us first:--
 
“the _czarina catherine_ left thames yesterday morning. will take
 quickest speed ever made least three weeks to
 reach varna; can travel overland place three days.

 weather influences know count can bring bear; if

 can nothing here; think varna familiar of

 to-night to-morrow can get ready, then, well, we

“we four?” said harker interrogatively, looking one another of
 us.
 
“of course!” answered professor quickly, “you must remain take
 care sweet wife!” harker silent awhile said
 hollow voice:--
 
“let us talk part morning. want consult with
 mina.” thought now time helsing warn not
 disclose plans her; took notice. looked him
 significantly coughed. answer put finger lips and
 turned away.

“jonathan, want promise something word honour. a

“i promise!” said, moment looked supremely happy; though
 happiness denied red scar forehead.
 said:--
 
“promise will tell anything plans formed for

 solemnly pointed scar. saw earnest, said
 solemnly:--
 
“i promise!” said felt instant door had
 shut us.

_later, midnight._--mina bright cheerful evening.
 much rest seemed take courage, infected
 somewhat gaiety; result even felt pall

dr. seward’s diary
 

_11 october, evening._--jonathan harker asked note this, he
 says hardly equal task, wants exact record kept.
 
think none us surprised asked see mrs.
 harker little time sunset. late come to
 understand sunrise sunset times peculiar freedom;
 old self can manifest without controlling force subduing
 restraining her, inciting action. mood condition
 begins half hour actual sunrise sunset, lasts
 till either sun high, whilst clouds still aglow with
 rays streaming horizon. first sort of
 negative condition, tie loosened, absolute
 freedom quickly follows; when, however, freedom ceases the
 change-back relapse comes quickly, preceded spell of
 warning silence.
 
to-night, met, somewhat constrained, bore the
 signs internal struggle. put making a
 violent effort earliest instant so. few
 minutes, however, gave complete control herself; then, motioning
 husband sit beside sofa half reclining,
 made rest us bring chairs close. taking husband’s hand
 began:--
 
“we together freedom, perhaps last time! know,
 dear; know will always end.” to
 husband whose hand had, see, tightened upon hers. “in
 morning go upon task, god alone knows may in
 store us. going good take me
 you. know brave earnest men can poor weak
 woman, whose soul perhaps lost--no, no, yet, rate
 stake--you will do. must remember are.
 poison blood, soul, may destroy me; which
 must destroy me, unless relief comes us. oh, friends, you
 know well do, soul stake; though know there
 one way me, must must take it!” looked
 appealingly us turn, beginning ending husband.
 
“what way?” asked helsing hoarse voice. “what that
 way, must not--may not--take?”
 
“that may die now, either hand another, before
 greater evil entirely wrought. know, know, i
 dead set free immortal spirit, even you
 poor lucy’s. death, fear death, thing
 stood way shrink die here, now, amidst the
 friends love me. death all. believe die
 case, hope us bitter task be
 done, god’s will. therefore, i, part, give the
 certainty eternal rest, go dark may the
 blackest things world nether world holds!” all
 silent, knew instinctively prelude. the
 faces others set harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps he
 guessed better us coming. continued:--
 
“this can give hotch-pot.” note the
 quaint legal phrase used place, all
 seriousness. “what will give? lives know,” went
 quickly, “that easy brave men. lives god’s, you
 can give back him; will give me?” looked
 questioningly, time avoided husband’s face. quincey
 seemed understand; nodded, face lit up. “then shall tell
 plainly want, must doubtful matter this
 connection us now. must promise me, one all--even you,
 beloved husband--that, time come, will kill me.”
 
“what time?” voice quincey’s, low and
 strained.
 
“when shall convinced changed better that
 die may live. thus dead flesh, will,
 without moment’s delay, drive stake cut head;
 whatever else may wanting give rest!”
 
quincey first rise pause. knelt her
 taking hand said solemnly:--
 
“i’m rough fellow, hasn’t, perhaps, lived man to
 win distinction, swear hold sacred and
 dear that, time ever come, shall flinch duty
 set us. promise you, too, shall make all
 certain, doubtful shall take time has
 come!”
 
“my true friend!” say amid fast-falling tears, as,
 bending over, kissed hand.
 
“i swear same, dear madam mina!” said helsing.
 
“and i!” said lord godalming, turn kneeling to
 take oath. followed, myself. husband turned her
 wan-eyed greenish pallor subdued snowy whiteness of
 hair, asked:--
 
“and must i, too, make promise, oh, wife?”
 
“you too, dearest,” said, infinite yearning pity her
 voice eyes. “you must shrink. nearest dearest and
 world me; souls knit one, life all
 time. think, dear, times brave men killed
 wives womenkind, keep falling the
 hands enemy. hands falter because
 loved implored slay them. men’s duty
 towards love, times sore trial! oh, my
 dear, must meet death hand, let at
 hand loves best. dr. helsing, not
 forgotten mercy poor lucy’s case loved”--she stopped
 flying blush, changed phrase--“to best right
 give peace. time shall come again, look make
 happy memory husband’s life loving hand which
 set free awful thrall upon me.”
 
“again swear!” came professor’s resonant voice. mrs. harker
 smiled, positively smiled, sigh relief leaned back and
 said:--
 
“and now one word warning, warning must never forget:
 time, ever come, may come quickly unexpectedly, in
 case must lose time using opportunity. a
 time might be--nay! time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued
 enemy you.”
 
“one request;” became solemn said this, “it not
 vital necessary like other, want one thing for
 me, will.” acquiesced, one spoke; need
 speak:--
 
“i want read burial service.” interrupted deep
 groan husband; taking hand hers, held her
 heart, continued: “you must read day. whatever may
 issue fearful state things, will sweet
 thought us. you, dearest, will hope read it, for
 will voice memory ever--come may!”
 
“but oh, dear one,” pleaded, “death afar you.”
 
“nay,” said, holding warning hand. “i deeper death at
 moment weight earthly grave lay heavy upon me!”
 
“oh, wife, must read it?” said, began.
 
“it comfort me, husband!” said; began to
 read got book ready.
 
“how can i--how one--tell strange scene, its
 solemnity, gloom, sadness, horror; and, withal, its
 sweetness. even sceptic, can see nothing travesty bitter
 truth anything holy emotional, melted heart
 seen little group loving devoted friends kneeling
 round stricken sorrowing lady; heard tender passion of
 husband’s voice, tones broken emotion often he
 pause, read simple beautiful service burial
 dead. i--i go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!”
 
* * * * *
 
right instinct. strange was, bizarre may
 hereafter seem even us felt potent influence time, it
 comforted us much; silence, showed mrs. harker’s coming
 relapse freedom soul, seem full despair any
 us dreaded.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_15 october, varna._--we left charing cross morning 12th,
 got paris night, took places secured us the
 orient express. travelled night day, arriving five
 o’clock. lord godalming went consulate see telegram had
 arrived him, whilst rest us came hotel--“the
 odessus.” journey may incidents; was, however, eager
 get on, care them. _czarina catherine_ comes into
 port will interest anything wide world.
 thank god! mina well, looks getting stronger; colour is
 coming back. sleeps great deal; throughout journey slept
 nearly time. sunrise sunset, however, very
 wakeful alert; become habit helsing to
 hypnotise times. first, effort needed, he
 make many passes; now, seems yield once, by
 habit, scarcely action needed. seems power at
 particular moments simply will, thoughts obey him. he
 always asks can see hear. answers first:--
 
“nothing; dark.” second:--
 
“i can hear waves lapping ship, water rushing
 by. canvas cordage strain masts yards creak. wind is
 high--i can hear shrouds, bow throws back foam.”
 evident _czarina catherine_ still sea, hastening on
 way varna. lord godalming just returned. four
 telegrams, one day since started, effect:
 _czarina catherine_ reported lloyd’s from
 anywhere. arranged leaving london agent should
 send every day telegram saying ship reported. he
 message even reported, might be
 sure watch kept end wire.
 
dinner went bed early. to-morrow see the
 vice-consul, arrange, can, getting board ship
 soon arrives. helsing says chance will get
 boat sunrise sunset. count, even takes the
 form bat, cross running water volition, and
 leave ship. dare change man’s form without
 suspicion--which evidently wishes avoid--he must remain the
 box. if, then, can come board sunrise, mercy;
 can open box make sure him, poor lucy,
 wakes. mercy shall get us will count for
 much. think shall much trouble officials the
 seamen. thank god! country bribery can anything,
 well supplied money. make sure the
 ship come port sunset sunrise without being
 warned, shall safe. judge moneybag will settle case, i
 think!
 
* * * * *
 
_16 october._--mina’s report still same: lapping waves rushing
 water, darkness favouring winds. evidently good time, and
 hear _czarina catherine_ shall ready. must
 pass dardanelles sure report.
 
* * * * *
 
_17 october._--everything pretty well fixed now, think, welcome
 count return tour. godalming told shippers that
 fancied box sent aboard might contain something stolen from
 friend his, got half consent might open own
 risk. owner gave paper telling captain give every
 facility whatever chose board ship, also a
 similar authorisation agent varna. seen agent, who
 much impressed godalming’s kindly manner him, all
 satisfied whatever can aid wishes will done. we
 already arranged case get box open. the
 count there, helsing seward will cut head and
 drive stake heart. morris godalming shall
 prevent interference, even use arms shall
 ready. professor says can treat count’s body,
 will soon fall dust. case no
 evidence us, case suspicion murder aroused. but
 even not, stand fall act, perhaps
 day script may evidence come us and
 rope. myself, take chance thankfully it
 come. mean leave stone unturned carry our
 intent. arranged certain officials instant the
 _czarina catherine_ seen, informed special
 messenger.
 
* * * * *
 
_24 october._--a whole week waiting. daily telegrams godalming,
 story: “not yet reported.” mina’s morning evening
 hypnotic answer unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, creaking
 masts.
 
_telegram, october 24th._
 
_rufus smith, lloyd’s, london, lord godalming, care h. b. m.
 vice-consul, varna._
 
“_czarina catherine_ reported morning dardanelles.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_25 october._--how miss phonograph! write diary pen is
 irksome me; helsing says must. wild with
 excitement yesterday godalming got telegram lloyd’s. i
 know now men feel battle call action heard. mrs.
 harker, alone party, show signs emotion. after
 all, strange not; took special care to
 let know anything it, tried show any
 excitement presence. old days would, am
 sure, noticed, matter might tried conceal it; but
 way greatly changed past three weeks. the
 lethargy grows upon her, though seems strong well, is
 getting back colour, helsing satisfied. we
 talk often; not, however, said word others. it
 break poor harker’s heart--certainly nerve--if knew we
 even suspicion subject. helsing examines, tells me,
 teeth carefully, whilst hypnotic condition, for
 says long begin sharpen active
 danger change her. change come, be
 necessary take steps!... know steps to
 be, though mention thoughts other. should
 neither us shrink task--awful though contemplate.
 “euthanasia” excellent comforting word! grateful to
 whoever invented it.
 
24 hours’ sail dardanelles here, the
 rate _czarina catherine_ come london. therefore
 arrive time morning; possibly get in
 then, retire early. shall get one
 o’clock, ready.
 
* * * * *
 
_25 october, noon_.--no news yet ship’s arrival. mrs. harker’s
 hypnotic report morning usual, possible
 may get news moment. men fever of
 excitement, except harker, calm; hands cold ice, and
 hour ago found whetting edge great ghoorka knife
 now always carries him. will bad lookout the
 count edge “kukri” ever touches throat, driven by
 stern, ice-cold hand!
 
helsing little alarmed mrs. harker to-day. about
 noon got sort lethargy like; although we
 kept silence others, neither us happy it. she
 restless morning, first glad know
 sleeping. when, however, husband mentioned casually
 sleeping soundly wake her, went to
 room see ourselves. breathing naturally looked so
 well peaceful agreed sleep better than
 anything else. poor girl, much forget wonder
 sleep, brings oblivion her, good.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--our opinion justified, refreshing sleep
 hours woke up, seemed brighter better had
 days. sunset made usual hypnotic report. wherever he
 may black sea, count hurrying destination. to
 doom, trust!
 
* * * * *
 
_26 october._--another day tidings _czarina catherine_.
 now. still journeying _somewhere_ is
 apparent, mrs. harker’s hypnotic report sunrise still the
 same. possible vessel may lying by, times, fog;
 steamers came last evening reported patches fog
 north south port. must continue watching, as
 ship may now signalled moment.
 
* * * * *
 
_27 october, noon._--most strange; news yet ship wait for.
 mrs. harker reported last night morning usual: “lapping
 waves rushing water,” though added “the waves very
 faint.” telegrams london same: “no further
 report.” helsing terribly anxious, told just now he
 fears count escaping us. added significantly:--
 
“i like lethargy madam mina’s. souls memories can do
 strange things trance.” ask more, harker
 just came in, held warning hand. must try to-night
 sunset make speak fully hypnotic state.
 
* * * * *
 
_28 october._--telegram. _rufus smith, london, lord godalming,
 care h. b. m. vice consul, varna._
 
“_czarina catherine_ reported entering galatz one o’clock
 to-day.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_28 october._--when telegram came announcing arrival galatz i
 think shock us might been
 expected. true, know whence, how, when, bolt would
 come; think expected something strange happen.
 delay arrival varna made us individually satisfied things
 just expected; waited learn the
 change occur. none less, however, surprise. suppose
 nature works hopeful basis believe against
 things will be, know
 will be. transcendentalism beacon angels, even if
 will-o’-the-wisp man. odd experience all
 took differently. helsing raised hand head a
 moment, though remonstrance almighty; said a
 word, seconds stood face sternly set. lord
 godalming grew pale, sat breathing heavily. half
 stunned looked wonder one another. quincey morris
 tightened belt quick movement knew well; our
 old wandering days meant “action.” mrs. harker grew ghastly white, so
 scar forehead seemed burn, folded hands
 meekly looked prayer. harker smiled--actually smiled--the
 dark, bitter smile one without hope; time his
 action belied words, hands instinctively sought hilt of
 great kukri knife rested there. “when next train start
 galatz?” said helsing us generally.
 
“at 6:30 to-morrow morning!” started, answer came from
 mrs. harker.
 
“how earth know?” said art.
 
“you forget--or perhaps know, though jonathan so
 dr. helsing--that train fiend. home exeter i
 always used make time-tables, helpful my
 husband. found useful sometimes, always make study of
 time-tables now. knew anything take us castle
 dracula go galatz, rate bucharest, i
 learned times carefully. unhappily many learn,
 train to-morrow leaves say.”
 
“wonderful woman!” murmured professor.
 
“can’t get special?” asked lord godalming. helsing shook his
 head: “i fear not. land different mine; even
 special, probably arrive soon our
 regular train. moreover, something prepare. must think.
 now let us organize. you, friend arthur, go train get the
 tickets arrange ready us go morning. do
 you, friend jonathan, go agent ship get him
 letters agent galatz, authority make search ship
 just here. morris quincey, see vice-consul, get
 aid fellow galatz can make way
 smooth, times lost danube. john will stay
 madam mina me, shall consult. time long you
 may delayed; will matter sun set, since here
 madam make report.”
 
“and i,” said mrs. harker brightly, like old self she
 many long day, “shall try use ways, and
 shall think write used do. something shifting
 strange way, feel freer late!”
 three younger men looked happier moment seemed to
 realise significance words; helsing i, turning to
 other, met grave troubled glance. said nothing the
 time, however.
 
three men gone tasks helsing asked mrs.
 harker look copy diaries find part of
 harker’s journal castle. went away get it; door
 shut upon said me:--
 
“we mean same! speak out!”
 
“there change. hope makes sick, may
 deceive us.”
 
“quite so. know asked get manuscript?”
 
“no!” said i, “unless get opportunity seeing alone.”
 
“you part right, friend john, part. want tell
 something. oh, friend, taking great--a terrible--risk;

thought professor going break hysterics,
 just lucy died, great effort controlled
 perfect nervous poise mrs. harker tripped into
 room, bright happy-looking and, work, seemingly
 forgetful misery. came in, handed number sheets
 typewriting helsing. looked gravely, face
 brightening read. holding pages finger and
 thumb said:--
 
“friend john, much experience already--and you, too,

 mrs. harker began clap hands eyes sparkled. went on:--
 
“now shall speak. tell us two dry men science see with

 unconsciously, spoke:--
 
“the count criminal criminal type. nordau lombroso would

dr. seward’s diary
 

_29 october._--this written train varna galatz. last
 night assembled little time sunset. us
 done work well could; far thought, endeavour,
 opportunity go, prepared whole journey, and
 work get galatz. usual time came round mrs.
 harker prepared hypnotic effort; longer and
 serious effort part helsing usually
 necessary, sank trance. usually speaks hint; but
 time professor ask questions, ask pretty
 resolutely, learn anything; last answer came:--
 
“i can see nothing; still; waves lapping, a
 steady swirl water softly running hawser. can hear
 men’s voices calling, near far, roll creak oars in
 rowlocks. gun fired somewhere; echo seems far away.
 tramping feet overhead, ropes chains dragged
 along. this? gleam light; can feel air
 blowing upon me.”
 
stopped. risen, impulsively, lay
 sofa, raised hands, palms upwards, lifting a
 weight. helsing looked understanding.
 quincey raised eyebrows slightly looked intently, whilst
 harker’s hand instinctively closed round hilt kukri. there
 long pause. knew time speak was
 passing; felt useless say anything. suddenly she
 sat up, and, opened eyes, said sweetly:--
 
“would none like cup tea? must tired!” we
 make happy, acquiesced. bustled get
 tea; gone helsing said:--
 
“you see, friends. _he_ close land: left his
 earth-chest. yet get shore. night may lie
 hidden somewhere; carried shore, ship do
 touch it, achieve land. case can, be
 night, change form can jump fly shore, did
 whitby. day come get shore, then, unless he
 carried escape. carried, customs men
 may discover box contain. thus, fine, escape on
 shore to-night, dawn, will whole day lost him.
 may arrive time; escape night shall come
 daytime, boxed mercy; dare his
 true self, awake visible, lest discovered.”
 
said, waited patience dawn;
 time might learn mrs. harker.
 
early morning listened, breathless anxiety, her
 response trance. hypnotic stage even longer coming
 before; came time remaining full sunrise was
 short began despair. helsing seemed throw whole
 soul effort; last, obedience will made
 reply:--
 
“all dark. hear lapping water, level me, creaking as
 wood wood.” paused, red sun shot up. must wait till
 to-night.
 
travelling towards galatz agony of
 expectation. due arrive two three morning;
 already, bucharest, three hours late, cannot
 possibly get till well sun-up. thus shall two more
 hypnotic messages mrs. harker; either may possibly throw
 light happening.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--sunset come gone. fortunately came time when
 distraction; occurred whilst a
 station, might secured necessary calm isolation.
 mrs. harker yielded hypnotic influence even less readily than
 morning. fear power reading count’s
 sensations may die away, just want most. seems that
 imagination beginning work. whilst trance
 hitherto confined simplest facts. goes
 may ultimately mislead us. thought count’s power
 die away equally power knowledge be
 happy thought; afraid may so. did
 speak, words enigmatical:--
 
“something going out; can feel pass like cold wind. can
 hear, far off, confused sounds--as men talking strange tongues,
 fierce-falling water, howling wolves.” stopped a
 shudder ran her, increasing intensity seconds,
 till, end, shook though palsy. said more, even
 answer professor’s imperative questioning. woke from
 trance, cold, exhausted, languid; mind was
 alert. remember anything, asked said;
 told, pondered deeply long time in
 silence.
 
* * * * *
 
_30 october, 7 a. m._--we near galatz now, may time
 write later. sunrise morning anxiously looked us all.
 knowing increasing difficulty procuring hypnotic trance,
 helsing began passes earlier usual. produced no
 effect, however, regular time, yielded still
 greater difficulty, minute sun rose. professor
 lost time questioning; answer came equal quickness:--

_mina harker’s memorandum._
 
(entered journal.)
 
_ground inquiry._--count dracula’s problem get back own
 place.
 
(_a_) must _brought back_ one. evident; he
 power move wished go either man, wolf,
 bat, way. evidently fears discovery or
 interference, state helplessness must be--confined
 dawn sunset wooden box.
 
(_b_) _how taken?_--here process exclusions may help
 us. road, rail, water?
 
1. _by road._--there endless difficulties, especially leaving the
 city.
 
(_x_) people; people curious, investigate. hint,
 surmise, doubt might box, destroy him.
 
(_y_) are, may be, customs octroi officers pass.
 
(_z_) pursuers might follow. highest fear; order
 prevent betrayed repelled, far can, even
 victim--me!
 
2. _by rail._--there one charge box. to
 take chance delayed; delay fatal, enemies
 track. true, might escape night; be, if
 left strange place refuge fly to? not
 intends; mean risk it.
 
3. _by water._--here safest way, one respect, most
 danger another. water powerless except night; even
 can summon fog storm snow wolves. were
 wrecked, living water engulf him, helpless; would
 indeed lost. vessel drive land; were
 unfriendly land, wherein free move, position would
 still desperate.
 
know record water; do
 ascertain _what_ water.
 
first thing realise exactly done yet; may,
 then, get light later task be.
 
_firstly._--we must differentiate london part
 general plan action, pressed moments had
 arrange best could.
 
_secondly_ must see, well can surmise facts we
 know of, done here.
 
first, evidently intended arrive galatz, sent
 invoice varna deceive us lest ascertain means of
 exit england; immediate sole purpose escape.
 proof this, letter instructions sent immanuel
 hildesheim clear take away box _before sunrise_. is
 also instruction petrof skinsky. must guess at; but
 must letter message, since skinsky came to
 hildesheim.
 
that, far, plans successful know. _czarina catherine_
 made phenomenally quick journey--so much captain donelson’s
 suspicions aroused; superstition united canniness
 played count’s game him, ran favouring wind
 fogs till brought blindfold galatz. the
 count’s arrangements well made, proved. hildesheim cleared
 box, took off, gave skinsky. skinsky took it--and here
 lose trail. know box somewhere water,
 moving along. customs octroi, any, been
 avoided.
 
now come count must done arrival--_on
 land_, galatz.
 
box given skinsky sunrise. sunrise count could
 appear form. here, ask skinsky chosen to
 aid work? husband’s diary, skinsky mentioned dealing
 slovaks trade river port; man’s
 remark, murder work slovak, showed general
 feeling class. count wanted isolation.
 
surmise is, this: london count decided get back his
 castle water, safe secret way. brought from
 castle szgany, probably delivered cargo slovaks
 took boxes varna, shipped london.
 thus count knowledge persons arrange this
 service. box land, sunrise sunset, he
 came box, met skinsky instructed to
 arranging carriage box river. done, and
 knew train, blotted traces, thought,
 murdering agent.
 
examined map find river suitable the
 slovaks ascended either pruth sereth. read in
 typescript trance heard cows low water swirling
 level ears creaking wood. count box, then,
 river open boat--propelled probably either oars or
 poles, banks near working stream. there
 sound floating stream.
 
course may either sereth pruth, may
 possibly investigate further. now two, pruth more
 easily navigated, sereth is, fundu, joined bistritza
 runs round borgo pass. loop makes manifestly as
 close dracula’s castle can got water.
 

_mina harker’s journal--continued._
 
done reading, jonathan took arms kissed me. the
 others kept shaking hands, dr. helsing said:--
 
“our dear madam mina teacher. eyes where
 blinded. now track again, time we
 may succeed. enemy helpless; can come on
 day, water, task will over. start, he
 powerless hasten, may leave box lest carry
 may suspect; suspect prompt throw

 council war; for, now, must plan all
 shall do.”
 
“i shall get steam launch follow him,” said lord godalming.
 
“and i, horses follow bank lest chance land,” said mr.
 morris.
 
“good!” said professor, “both good. neither must go alone. there
 must force overcome force need be; slovak strong and
 rough, carries rude arms.” men smiled, amongst them
 carried small arsenal. said mr. morris:--
 
“i brought winchesters; pretty handy crowd, and
 may wolves. count, remember, took other
 precautions; made requisitions others mrs. harker could
 quite hear understand. must ready points.” dr.
 seward said:--
 
“i think better go quincey. accustomed hunt
 together, two, well armed, will match whatever may come
 along. must alone, art. may necessary fight the
 slovaks, chance thrust--for don’t suppose fellows carry
 guns--would undo plans. must chances, time; we
 shall rest count’s head body separated, and
 sure re-incarnate.” looked jonathan he
 spoke, jonathan looked me. see poor dear was
 torn mind. course wanted me; the
 boat service would, likely, one destroy ...
 ... ... vampire. (why hesitate write word?) was
 silent awhile, silence dr. helsing spoke:--
 
“friend jonathan, twice reasons. first, you
 young brave can fight, energies may needed the
 last; right destroy him--that--which has
 wrought woe yours. afraid madam mina; she
 will care, may. old. legs quick run as
 once; used ride long pursue need be, to
 fight lethal weapons. can service; can fight in
 way. can die, need be, well younger men. now let
 say this: you, lord godalming and
 friend jonathan go swift little steamboat river, and
 whilst john quincey guard bank perchance might be
 landed, will take madam mina right heart enemy’s
 country. whilst old fox tied box, floating running
 stream whence escape land--where dares raise lid
 coffin-box lest slovak carriers fear leave to
 perish--we shall go track jonathan went,--from bistritz
 borgo, find way castle dracula. here, madam
 mina’s hypnotic power will surely help, shall find way--all
 dark unknown otherwise--after first sunrise near
 fateful place. much done, places be
 made sanctify, nest vipers obliterated.” here
 jonathan interrupted hotly:--
 
“do mean say, professor helsing, bring mina,
 sad case tainted devil’s illness, right
 jaws death-trap? world! heaven or
 hell!” became almost speechless minute, went on:--
 
“do know place is? seen awful den hellish
 infamy--with moonlight alive grisly shapes, every
 speck dust whirls wind devouring monster embryo?
 felt vampire’s lips upon throat?” turned to
 me, eyes lit forehead threw arms cry:
 “oh, god, done terror upon us!” sank
 sofa collapse misery. professor’s voice, he
 spoke clear, sweet tones, seemed vibrate air, calmed
 us all:--
 
“oh, friend, save madam mina awful
 place go. god forbid take that
 place. work--wild work--to done there, eyes may not
 see. men here, save jonathan, seen eyes what
 done place can purify. remember in
 terrible straits. count escape us time--and strong and
 subtle cunning--he may choose sleep century, then
 time dear one”--he took hand--“would come keep him
 company, others you, jonathan, saw. have
 told us gloating lips; heard ribald laugh they
 clutched moving bag count threw them. shudder; and
 well may be. forgive make much pain, is
 necessary. friend, dire need giving,
 possibly life? one went place stay,
 go keep company.”
 
“do will,” said jonathan, sob shook over, “we
 hands god!”
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--oh, good see way brave men worked.
 can women help loving men earnest, true, and
 brave! and, too, made think wonderful power money!
 can properly applied; might do
 basely used. felt thankful lord godalming rich, and
 mr. morris, also plenty money, willing
 spend freely. not, little expedition could
 start, either promptly well equipped, will within
 another hour. three hours since arranged part each
 us do; now lord godalming jonathan lovely steam
 launch, steam ready start moment’s notice. dr. seward
 mr. morris half dozen good horses, well appointed. have
 maps appliances various kinds can had. professor

 forehead forbids that. dear dr. helsing comforts telling me

_october 30. night._--i writing light furnace

 experienced hand work, years launch his
 thames, another norfolk broads. regarding our
 plans, finally decided mina’s guess correct, any
 waterway chosen count’s escape back castle, the
 sereth bistritza junction, one. took
 it, somewhere 47th degree, north latitude, the
 place chosen crossing country river the
 carpathians. fear running good speed river at
 night; plenty water, banks wide enough apart to
 make steaming, even dark, easy enough. lord godalming tells to
 sleep while, enough present one on
 watch. sleep--how can terrible danger hanging
 darling, going awful place.... only
 comfort hands god. faith would
 easier die live, quit trouble. mr.
 morris dr. seward long ride started;
 keep right bank, far enough get higher
 lands can see good stretch river avoid following
 curves. have, first stages, two men ride lead
 spare horses--four all, excite curiosity. when
 dismiss men, shall shortly, shall look
 horses. may necessary us join forces; they
 can mount whole party. one saddles movable horn, and
 can easily adapted mina, required.
 
wild adventure on. here, rushing along through

_1 november, evening._--no news day; found nothing the
 kind seek. now passed bistritza; wrong
 surmise chance gone. over-hauled every boat, big
 little. early morning, one crew took us government boat,
 treated us accordingly. saw way smoothing matters,
 fundu, bistritza runs sereth, got a
 roumanian flag now fly conspicuously. every boat we
 over-hauled since trick succeeded; every
 deference shown us, objection whatever chose

 going usual speed double crew board. this
 came fundu, tell us whether the

_5 november, morning._--let accurate everything, though you
 seen strange things together, may first think
 i, helsing, mad--that many horrors long
 strain nerves last turn brain.
 
yesterday travel, ever getting closer mountains, and
 moving wild desert land. great,
 frowning precipices much falling water, nature seem held
 sometime carnival. madam mina still sleep sleep; though i
 hunger appeased it, waken her--even food. i
 began fear fatal spell place upon her, tainted as
 vampire baptism. “well,” said myself, “if be
 sleep day, shall also sleep at
 night.” travel rough road, road ancient and
 imperfect kind was, held head slept. waked
 sense guilt time passed, found madam mina still
 sleeping, sun low down. indeed changed; frowning
 mountains seemed away, near top a
 steep-rising hill, summit castle jonathan tell
 diary. exulted feared; now, good ill,
 end near.
 
woke madam mina, tried hypnotise her; alas!
 unavailing till late. then, ere great dark came upon us--for
 even down-sun heavens reflected gone sun snow, and
 time great twilight--i took horses fed
 shelter could. make fire; near make
 madam mina, now awake charming ever, sit comfortable amid
 rugs. got ready food: eat, simply saying that
 hunger. press her, knowing unavailingness. but
 eat, must needs now strong all. then, the
 fear might be, drew ring big comfort, round
 madam mina sat; ring passed wafer, and
 broke fine well guarded. sat still the
 time--so still one dead; grew whiter ever whiter till the
 snow pale; word said. drew near, she
 clung me, know poor soul shook head to
 feet tremor pain feel. said presently, when
 grown quiet:--
 
“will come fire?” wished make test of
 could. rose obedient, made step she
 stopped, stood one stricken.
 
“why go on?” asked. shook head, and, coming back, sat
 place. then, looking open eyes, one waked
 sleep, said simply:--
 
“i cannot!” remained silent. rejoiced, knew she

 whinnied low joy, licked hands quiet a
 time. many times night come them, till arrive to
 cold hour nature lowest; every time coming was
 quiet them. cold hour fire began die, was
 stepping forth replenish it, now snow came flying
 sweeps chill mist. even dark light of
 kind, ever snow; seemed though the
 snow-flurries wreaths mist took shape women with
 trailing garments. dead, grim silence horses
 whinnied cowered, terror worst. began to
 fear--horrible fears; came sense safety that
 ring wherein stood. began, too, think imaginings of
 night, gloom, unrest gone through, and
 terrible anxiety. though memories jonathan’s
 horrid experience befooling me; snow flakes mist
 began wheel circle round, till get though shadowy
 glimpse women kissed him. horses
 cowered lower lower, moaned terror men pain. even
 madness fright them, break away. i
 feared dear madam mina weird figures drew near and
 circled round. looked her, sat calm, smiled me; when
 stepped fire replenish it, caught held
 back, whispered, like voice one hears dream, low
 was:--
 
“no! no! go without. safe!” turned her, and
 looking eyes, said:--
 
“but you? fear!” whereat laughed--a laugh, low
 unreal, said:--
 
“fear _me_! fear me? none safer world them
 am,” wondered meaning words, puff of
 wind made flame leap up, see red scar forehead.
 then, alas! knew. not, soon learned, the

 bright hard eyes, white teeth, ruddy colour, voluptuous
 lips. smiled ever poor dear madam mina; laugh came
 silence night, twined arms pointed to
 her, said sweet tingling tones jonathan said were
 intolerable sweetness water-glasses:--
 
“come, sister. come us. come! come!” fear turned poor
 madam mina, heart gladness leapt like flame; oh! the
 terror sweet eyes, repulsion, horror, told story my
 heart hope. god thanked not, yet, them. i
 seized firewood me, holding the

 beasts terror.
 
remained till red dawn fall the
 snow-gloom. desolate afraid, full woe terror; but
 beautiful sun began climb horizon life again.
 first coming dawn horrid figures melted the
 whirling mist snow; wreaths transparent gloom moved away
 towards castle, lost.
 
instinctively, dawn coming, turned madam mina, intending

_6 november._--it late afternoon professor i
 took way towards east whence knew jonathan coming. did
 go fast, though way steeply downhill, take
 heavy rugs wraps us; dared face possibility being
 left without warmth cold snow. take our
 provisions, too, perfect desolation, and, far we
 see snowfall, even sign of
 habitation. gone mile, tired heavy
 walking sat rest. looked back saw the
 clear line dracula’s castle cut sky; deep under

 hear distant howling wolves. far off, the
 sound, even though coming muffled deadening snowfall, was
 full terror. knew way dr. helsing searching about

 trace drifted snow.
 
little professor signalled me, got joined

 wolves come can meet one one.” brought our
 furs, made snug nest me, got provisions and
 forced upon me. eat; even try was

 bring attempt. looked sad, not
 reproach me. taking field-glasses case, stood top
 rock, began search horizon. suddenly called out:--
 
“look! madam mina, look! look!” sprang stood beside the
 rock; handed glasses pointed. snow now falling
 heavily, swirled fiercely, high wind beginning
 blow. however, times pauses the
 snow flurries see long way round. height we
 possible see great distance; far off, beyond the
 white waste snow, see river lying like black ribbon in
 kinks curls wound way. straight front us far
 off--in fact, near wondered noticed before--came a
 group mounted men hurrying along. midst cart, a

 felt end coming. evening now drawing close, and
 well knew sunset thing, till imprisoned

 however, there. instant later, saw me. round
 rock drawn circle, found shelter last
 night. completed stood beside again, saying:--
 
“at least shall safe _him_!” took glasses from
 me, next lull snow swept whole space us.
 “see,” said, “they come quickly; flogging horses, and
 galloping hard can.” paused went hollow
 voice:--
 
“they racing sunset. may late. god’s will be
 done!” came another blinding rush driving snow, whole
 landscape blotted out. soon passed, however, his
 glasses fixed plain. came sudden cry:--
 
“look! look! look! see, two horsemen follow fast, coming the
 south. must quincey john. take glass. look snow
 blots out!” took looked. two men might dr. seward
 mr. morris. knew events neither jonathan.
 time _knew_ jonathan far off; looking around
 saw north side coming party two men, riding at
 break-neck speed. one knew jonathan, took,
 course, lord godalming. they, too, pursuing party with
 cart. told professor shouted glee like schoolboy,
 and, looking intently till snow fall made sight impossible, he
 laid winchester rifle ready use boulder the
 opening shelter. “they converging,” said. “when the
 time comes shall gypsies sides.” got revolver

 louder closer. snow storm abated moment looked again.
 strange see snow falling heavy flakes close us,
 beyond, sun shining brightly sank down
 towards far mountain tops. sweeping glass around us could
 see dots moving singly twos threes larger
 numbers--the wolves gathering prey.
 
every instant seemed age whilst waited. wind came now in
 fierce bursts, snow driven fury swept upon us in
 circling eddies. times see arm’s length us;
 others, hollow-sounding wind swept us, seemed to
 clear air-space around us see afar off. of
 late accustomed watch sunrise sunset, knew
 fair accuracy be; knew long the
 sun set. hard believe watches less

 bodies began converge close upon us. wind came now fiercer

closer closer drew. professor crouched behind
 rock, held weapons ready; see determined
 pass. one quite unaware our
 presence.
 
two voices shouted to: “halt!” one jonathan’s,
 raised high key passion; mr. morris’ strong resolute
 tone quiet command. gypsies may known language, but
 mistaking tone, whatever tongue words were
 spoken. instinctively reined in, instant lord godalming
 jonathan dashed one side dr. seward mr. morris the
 other. leader gypsies, splendid-looking fellow sat his
 horse like centaur, waved back, fierce voice gave his
 companions word proceed. lashed horses sprang
 forward; four men raised winchester rifles, an
 unmistakable way commanded stop. moment dr. van

leader, quick movement rein, threw horse in

 surging desire something. seeing quick movement our
 parties, leader gypsies gave command; men instantly
 formed round cart sort undisciplined endeavour, one

midst see jonathan one side ring

 evident bent finishing task sun
 set. nothing seemed stop even hinder them. neither the
 levelled weapons flashing knives gypsies front, nor
 howling wolves behind, appeared even attract their
 attention. jonathan’s impetuosity, manifest singleness his
 purpose, seemed overawe front him; instinctively they
 cowered, aside let pass. instant jumped upon the
 cart, and, strength seemed incredible, raised great
 box, flung wheel ground. meantime, mr.
 morris use force pass side ring of

 jonathan, desperate energy, attacked one end chest,
 attempting prize lid great kukri knife, attacked
 frantically bowie. efforts men the
 lid began yield; nails drew quick screeching sound, and

but, instant, came sweep flash jonathan’s great knife.

 us alone.
 
mr. morris, sunk ground, leaned elbow, holding his

 running strong, sweep outside edge river clear. every
 station groups people, sometimes crowds, sorts

 saw coming france germany, short jackets round hats

 big belts lot strips something
 fluttering like dresses ballet, course there

 slovaks, barbarian rest, big cow-boy
 hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, enormous
 heavy leather belts, nearly foot wide, studded brass
 nails. wore high boots, trousers tucked them, and
 long black hair heavy black moustaches. very
 picturesque, look prepossessing. stage be
 set old oriental band brigands. are,
 however, told, harmless rather wanting natural
 self-assertion.
 
dark side twilight got bistritz, a
 interesting old place. practically frontier--for the
 borgo pass leads bukovina--it stormy
 existence, certainly shows marks it. fifty years ago series
 great fires took place, made terrible havoc five separate
 occasions. beginning seventeenth century underwent
 siege three weeks lost 13,000 people, casualties war

 making inquiries details seemed somewhat reticent, and
 pretended understand german. be
 true, understood perfectly; least, he
 answered questions exactly did. wife, old
 lady received me, looked frightened sort of
 way. mumbled money sent letter, that
 knew. asked knew count dracula, could
 tell anything castle, wife crossed themselves,
 and, saying knew nothing all, simply refused speak
 further. near time starting time ask
 one else, mysterious means
 comforting.
 
just leaving, old lady came room said a
 hysterical way:
 
“must go? oh! young herr, must go?” excited
 state seemed lost grip german knew, and
 mixed language know all. i
 just able follow asking many questions. told her
 must go once, engaged important business,
 asked again:
 
“do know day is?” answered fourth may.
 shook head said again:
 
“oh, yes! know that! know that, know day is?” on
 saying understand, went on:
 
“it eve st. george’s day. know to-night, when
 clock strikes midnight, evil things world will have
 full sway? know going, going to?”
 evident distress tried comfort her, but
 without effect. finally went knees implored not
 go; least wait day two starting. very
 ridiculous feel comfortable. however, business
 done, allow nothing interfere it. therefore
 tried raise up, said, gravely could, thanked

_5 may. castle._--the grey morning passed, sun is
 high distant horizon, seems jagged, whether trees or
 hills know not, far big things little are
 mixed. sleepy, and, called till awake,
 naturally write till sleep comes. many odd things put
 down, and, lest reads may fancy dined well i
 left bistritz, let put dinner exactly. dined they
 called “robber steak”--bits bacon, onion, beef, seasoned red
 pepper, strung sticks roasted fire, simple
 style london cat’s meat! wine golden mediasch, which
 produces queer sting tongue, is, however, not
 disagreeable. couple glasses this, nothing else.
 
got coach driver taken seat, saw him
 talking landlady. evidently talking me, every
 now looked me, people sitting
 bench outside door--which call name meaning
 “word-bearer”--came listened, looked me, them
 pityingly. hear lot words often repeated, queer words, for
 many nationalities crowd; quietly got polyglot
 dictionary bag looked out. must say not
 cheering me, amongst “ordog”--satan, “pokol”--hell,
 “stregoica”--witch, “vrolok” “vlkoslak”--both mean same
 thing, one slovak servian something is
 either were-wolf vampire. (_mem._, must ask count these
 superstitions)
 
started, crowd round inn door, time
 swelled considerable size, made sign cross and
 pointed two fingers towards me. difficulty got a
 fellow-passenger tell meant; answer at
 first, learning english, explained a
 charm guard evil eye. pleasant me,
 just starting unknown place meet unknown man; every one
 seemed kind-hearted, sorrowful, sympathetic i
 touched. shall never forget last glimpse i
 inn-yard crowd picturesque figures, crossing
 themselves, stood round wide archway, background of
 rich foliage oleander orange trees green tubs clustered the
 centre yard. driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
 whole front box-seat--“gotza” call them--cracked big
 whip four small horses, ran abreast, set on
 journey.
 
soon lost sight recollection ghostly fears beauty the
 scene drove along, although known language, rather
 languages, fellow-passengers speaking, might have
 able throw easily. us lay green sloping
 land full forests woods, steep hills, crowned
 clumps trees farmhouses, blank gable end the
 road. everywhere bewildering mass fruit blossom--apple,
 plum, pear, cherry; drove see green grass under
 trees spangled fallen petals. amongst these
 green hills call “mittel land” ran road,
 losing swept round grassy curve, shut the
 straggling ends pine woods, ran the
 hillsides like tongues flame. road rugged, still we
 seemed fly feverish haste. understand then
 haste meant, driver evidently bent losing no
 time reaching borgo prund. told road summertime
 excellent, yet put order winter
 snows. respect different general run roads in
 carpathians, old tradition kept
 good order. old hospadars repair them, lest the
 turk think preparing bring foreign troops,
 hasten war always really loading point.
 
beyond green swelling hills mittel land rose mighty slopes
 forest lofty steeps carpathians themselves. right
 left us towered, afternoon sun falling full upon
 bringing glorious colours beautiful range,
 deep blue purple shadows peaks, green brown where
 grass rock mingled, endless perspective jagged rock and
 pointed crags, till lost distance, where
 snowy peaks rose grandly. seemed mighty rifts the
 mountains, which, sun began sink, saw now again
 white gleam falling water. one companions touched arm as
 swept round base hill opened lofty, snow-covered
 peak mountain, seemed, wound serpentine way, to
 right us:--
 
“look! isten szek!”--“god’s seat!”--and crossed reverently.
 
wound endless way, sun sank lower lower behind
 us, shadows evening began creep round us. was
 emphasised fact snowy mountain-top still held the
 sunset, seemed glow delicate cool pink. there
 passed cszeks slovaks, picturesque attire, noticed
 goitre painfully prevalent. roadside many crosses,
 swept by, companions crossed themselves. there
 peasant man woman kneeling shrine, even
 turn round approached, seemed self-surrender of
 devotion neither eyes ears outer world. were
 many things new me: instance, hay-ricks trees, here
 beautiful masses weeping birch, white stems
 shining like silver delicate green leaves. now and
 passed leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant’s cart--with its
 long, snake-like vertebra, calculated suit inequalities the
 road. sure seated quite group home-coming
 peasants, cszeks white, slovaks their
 coloured, sheepskins, latter carrying lance-fashion long
 staves, axe end. evening fell began get cold,
 growing twilight seemed merge one dark mistiness the
 gloom trees, oak, beech, pine, though valleys which
 ran deep spurs hills, ascended the
 pass, dark firs stood background of
 late-lying snow. sometimes, road cut pine woods
 seemed darkness closing upon us, great masses of
 greyness, bestrewed trees, produced a
 peculiarly weird solemn effect, carried thoughts and
 grim fancies engendered earlier evening, falling sunset
 threw strange relief ghost-like clouds amongst the
 carpathians seem wind ceaselessly valleys. sometimes the
 hills steep that, despite driver’s haste, horses could
 go slowly. wished get walk them, home,
 driver hear it. “no, no,” said; “you must not
 walk here; dogs fierce”; added, he
 evidently meant grim pleasantry--for looked round catch the
 approving smile rest--“and may enough matters
 go sleep.” stop make moment’s
 pause light lamps.
 
grew dark seemed excitement amongst the
 passengers, kept speaking him, one other, as
 though urging speed. lashed horses unmercifully
 long whip, wild cries encouragement urged on
 exertions. darkness see sort of
 patch grey light ahead us, though cleft the
 hills. excitement passengers grew greater; crazy coach
 rocked great leather springs, swayed like boat tossed a
 stormy sea. hold on. road grew level, appeared
 fly along. mountains seemed come nearer us each
 side frown upon us; entering borgo pass. one
 one several passengers offered gifts, pressed
 upon earnestness take denial; were
 certainly odd varied kind, given simple good
 faith, kindly word, blessing, strange mixture of
 fear-meaning movements seen outside hotel at
 bistritz--the sign cross guard evil eye.
 then, flew along, driver leaned forward, side the
 passengers, craning edge coach, peered eagerly the
 darkness. evident something exciting either
 happening expected, though asked passenger, one would
 give slightest explanation. state excitement kept for
 little time; last saw us pass opening on
 eastern side. dark, rolling clouds overhead, the
 air heavy, oppressive sense thunder. seemed though the
 mountain range separated two atmospheres, now got
 thunderous one. now looking conveyance
 take count. moment expected see the
 glare lamps blackness; dark. light
 flickering rays lamps, steam our
 hard-driven horses rose white cloud. see now sandy
 road lying white us, sign vehicle.
 passengers drew back sigh gladness, seemed mock
 disappointment. already thinking best do, when
 driver, looking watch, said others something i
 hardly hear, spoken quietly low tone; i
 thought “an hour less time.” turning me, said
 german worse own:--
 
“there carriage here. herr expected all. will
 now come bukovina, return to-morrow next day; better
 next day.” whilst speaking horses began neigh and
 snort plunge wildly, driver hold up. then,
 amongst chorus screams peasants universal crossing
 themselves, calèche, four horses, drove behind us, overtook
 us, drew beside coach. see flash our
 lamps, rays fell them, horses coal-black and
 splendid animals. driven tall man, long brown
 beard great black hat, seemed hide face us. i
 see gleam pair bright eyes, seemed red
 lamplight, turned us. said driver:--
 
“you early to-night, friend.” man stammered reply:--
 
“the english herr hurry,” stranger replied:--
 
“that why, suppose, wished go bukovina. cannot
 deceive me, friend; know much, horses swift.” he
 spoke smiled, lamplight fell hard-looking mouth, with
 red lips sharp-looking teeth, white ivory. one my
 companions whispered another line burger’s “lenore”:--
 
“denn die todten reiten schnell”--
 (“for dead travel fast.”)
 
strange driver evidently heard words, looked a
 gleaming smile. passenger turned face away, time
 putting two fingers crossing himself. “give herr’s
 luggage,” said driver; exceeding alacrity bags were
 handed put calèche. descended side the
 coach, calèche close alongside, driver helping a
 hand caught arm grip steel; strength must been
 prodigious. without word shook reins, horses turned, we
 swept darkness pass. looked back saw steam
 horses coach light lamps, projected
 figures late companions crossing themselves. then
 driver cracked whip called horses, swept
 way bukovina. sank darkness felt a
 strange chill, lonely feeling came me; cloak thrown
 shoulders, rug across knees, driver said in
 excellent german:--
 
“the night chill, mein herr, master count bade take all
 care you. flask slivovitz (the plum brandy the
 country) underneath seat, require it.” take
 any, comfort know same. felt a
 little strangely, little frightened. think been
 alternative taken it, instead prosecuting that
 unknown night journey. carriage went hard pace straight along,
 made complete turn went along another straight road. it
 seemed simply going ground
 again; took note salient point, found was
 so. liked asked driver meant, but
 really feared so, thought that, placed was, any
 protest effect case intention to
 delay. by-and-by, however, curious know time was
 passing, struck match, flame looked watch; was
 within minutes midnight. gave sort shock, i
 suppose general superstition midnight increased my
 recent experiences. waited sick feeling suspense.
 
dog began howl somewhere farmhouse far road--a
 long, agonised wailing, fear. sound taken by
 another dog, another another, till, borne wind which
 now sighed softly pass, wild howling began, seemed
 come country, far imagination grasp
 gloom night. first howl horses began to
 strain rear, driver spoke soothingly, they
 quieted down, shivered sweated though runaway from
 sudden fright. then, far distance, mountains each
 side us began louder sharper howling--that wolves--which
 affected horses way--for minded to
 jump calèche run, whilst reared plunged
 madly, driver use great strength keep them
 bolting. minutes, however, ears got accustomed to
 sound, horses far became quiet driver able
 descend stand them. petted soothed them, and
 whispered something ears, heard horse-tamers
 doing, extraordinary effect, caresses became
 quite manageable again, though still trembled. driver again
 took seat, shaking reins, started great pace. this
 time, going far side pass, suddenly turned a
 narrow roadway ran sharply right.
 
soon hemmed trees, places arched right the
 roadway till passed tunnel; great frowning
 rocks guarded us boldly either side. though shelter, we
 hear rising wind, moaned whistled the
 rocks, branches trees crashed together swept along.
 grew colder colder still, fine, powdery snow began fall,
 soon around us covered white blanket. the
 keen wind still carried howling dogs, though grew
 fainter went way. baying wolves sounded nearer
 nearer, though closing round us every side. i
 grew dreadfully afraid, horses shared fear. driver,
 however, least disturbed; kept turning head to
 left right, see anything darkness.
 
suddenly, away left, saw faint flickering blue flame. the
 driver saw moment; checked horses, and,
 jumping ground, disappeared darkness. know
 do, less howling wolves grew closer; while
 wondered driver suddenly appeared again, without word took
 seat, resumed journey. think must fallen asleep
 kept dreaming incident, seemed repeated
 endlessly, now looking back, like sort awful nightmare.
 flame appeared near road, even darkness
 around us watch driver’s motions. went rapidly where
 blue flame arose--it must faint, seem
 illumine place around all--and gathering stones,
 formed device. appeared strange optical

 see ghostly flicker same. startled me, but
 effect momentary, took eyes deceived me

 flames, sped onwards gloom, howling the
 wolves around us, though following moving circle.
 
last came time driver went afield he
 yet gone, absence, horses began tremble worse
 ever snort scream fright. see cause
 it, howling wolves ceased altogether; just
 moon, sailing black clouds, appeared behind the
 jagged crest beetling, pine-clad rock, light saw
 around us ring wolves, white teeth lolling red tongues,
 long, sinewy limbs shaggy hair. hundred times more
 terrible grim silence held even howled.
 myself, felt sort paralysis fear. man
 feels face face horrors can understand
 true import.
 
wolves began howl though moonlight had
 peculiar effect them. horses jumped reared, and
 looked helplessly round eyes rolled way painful see;
 living ring terror encompassed every side; they
 perforce remain within it. called coachman come, for
 seemed chance try break the
 ring aid approach. shouted beat side the
 calèche, hoping noise scare wolves side, as
 give chance reaching trap. came there, know
 not, heard voice raised tone imperious command, and
 looking towards sound, saw stand roadway. swept his
 long arms, though brushing aside impalpable obstacle, wolves
 fell back back still. just heavy cloud passed across
 face moon, darkness.
 
see driver climbing calèche, the
 wolves disappeared. strange uncanny a
 dreadful fear came upon me, afraid speak move. time
 seemed interminable swept way, now almost complete
 darkness, rolling clouds obscured moon. kept on
 ascending, occasional periods quick descent, main
 always ascending. suddenly, became conscious fact the
 driver act pulling horses courtyard a
 vast ruined castle, whose tall black windows came ray light,
 whose broken battlements showed jagged line moonlit
 sky.

stood silence was, know do. bell

 expected suddenly awake, find home, with
 dawn struggling windows, now felt
 morning day overwork. flesh answered the
 pinching test, eyes deceived. indeed awake
 among carpathians. now patient, to
 wait coming morning.
 
just come conclusion heard heavy step approaching
 behind great door, saw chinks gleam coming
 light. sound rattling chains clanking of
 massive bolts drawn back. key turned loud grating noise
 long disuse, great door swung back.
 
within, stood tall old man, clean shaven save long white
 moustache, clad black head foot, without single speck

 gesture welcome fixed stone. instant, however, that
 stepped threshold, moved impulsively forward, and
 holding hand grasped mine strength made wince,

count halted, putting bags, closed door, crossing

 this, opened another door, motioned enter. a

 castle asked count’s permission. was
 absolutely nothing room, book, newspaper, even writing
 materials; opened another door room found sort of
 library. door opposite mine tried, found locked.
 
library found, great delight, vast number english
 books, whole shelves full them, bound volumes magazines and
 newspapers. table centre littered english magazines
 newspapers, though none recent date. books
 varied kind--history, geography, politics, political
 economy, botany, geology, law--all relating england english life
 customs manners. even books reference the
 london directory, “red” “blue” books, whitaker’s almanac, the
 army navy lists, and--it somehow gladdened heart see it--the
 law list.
 
whilst looking books, door opened, count
 entered. saluted hearty way, hoped good
 night’s rest. went on:--
 
“i glad found way here, sure much that
 will interest you. companions”--and laid hand of
 books--“have good friends me, years past, ever
 since idea going london, given many, many hours

“but, count,” said, “you know speak english thoroughly!” bowed
 gravely.
 
“i thank you, friend, too-flattering estimate, yet i
 fear little way road travel. true, know
 grammar words, yet know speak them.”
 
“indeed,” said, “you speak excellently.”
 
“not so,” answered. “well, know that, move speak your

course said willing, asked might
 come room chose. answered: “yes, certainly,” and
 added:--
 
“you may go anywhere wish castle, except doors are
 locked, course will wish go. reason that
 things are, see eyes know with
 knowledge, perhaps better understand.” said sure of
 this, went on:--
 
“we transylvania; transylvania england. ways are
 ways, shall many strange things. nay, from
 told experiences already, know something of
 strange things may be.”
 
led much conversation; evident wanted to
 talk, talking’s sake, asked many questions regarding
 things already happened come within notice.
 sometimes sheered subject, turned conversation by
 pretending understand; generally answered asked most
 frankly. time went on, got somewhat bolder, asked
 strange things preceding night, as, for
 instance, coachman went places seen blue
 flames. explained commonly believed a
 certain night year--last night, fact, evil spirits
 supposed unchecked sway--a blue flame seen place
 treasure concealed. “that treasure hidden,” he
 went on, “in region came last night, can be
 little doubt; ground fought centuries the
 wallachian, saxon, turk. why, hardly foot soil
 region enriched blood men,

 austrian hungarian came hordes, patriots went out
 meet them--men women, aged children too--and waited
 coming rocks passes, might sweep
 destruction artificial avalanches. invader
 triumphant found little, whatever been
 sheltered friendly soil.”
 
“but how,” said i, “can remained long undiscovered, when
 sure index men will take trouble look?”
 count smiled, lips ran back gums, long,
 sharp, canine teeth showed strangely; answered:--
 
“because peasant heart coward fool! flames only
 appear one night; night man land will, he
 can help it, stir without doors. and, dear sir, even he
 know do. why, even peasant tell who
 marked place flame know look daylight
 even work. even not, dare sworn, able to
 find places again?”
 
“there right,” said. “i know dead even
 look them.” drifted matters.
 
“come,” said last, “tell london house you
 procured me.” apology remissness, went my
 room get papers bag. whilst placing in
 order heard rattling china silver next room, i
 passed through, noticed table cleared lamp

 came cleared books papers table; i
 went plans deeds figures sorts. interested in
 everything, asked myriad questions place its
 surroundings. clearly studied beforehand get the
 subject neighbourhood, evidently end knew much

“well, but, friend, needful should? go there

 fall country’s habit putting patronymic first--my friend
 jonathan harker will side correct aid me. will be
 exeter, miles away, probably working papers law my
 friend, peter hawkins. so!”
 
went thoroughly business purchase estate at
 purfleet. told facts got signature the
 necessary papers, written letter ready post to
 mr. hawkins, began ask come across suitable a
 place. read notes made time, i
 inscribe here:--
 
“at purfleet, by-road, came across just place seemed to
 required, displayed dilapidated notice place
 sale. surrounded high wall, ancient structure,
 built heavy stones, repaired large number of
 years. closed gates heavy old oak iron, eaten with
 rust.
 
“the estate called carfax, doubt corruption old _quatre
 face_, house four-sided, agreeing cardinal points of
 compass. contains twenty acres, quite surrounded by
 solid stone wall mentioned. many trees it, which
 make places gloomy, deep, dark-looking pond or
 small lake, evidently fed springs, water clear and
 flows away fair-sized stream. house large all
 periods back, say, mediæval times, one part stone
 immensely thick, windows high heavily barred with
 iron. looks like part keep, close old chapel or

 various points. house added to, straggling

 large house recently added formed private lunatic
 asylum. not, however, visible grounds.”
 
finished, said:--
 
“i glad old big. old family, to

 also chapel old times. transylvanian nobles love

 heart, weary years mourning dead, not
 attuned mirth. moreover, walls castle broken; the
 shadows many, wind breathes cold broken
 battlements casements. love shade shadow, would

 seem accord, else cast face made his
 smile look malignant saturnine.
 
presently, excuse, left me, asking put papers
 together. little time away, began look of
 books around me. one atlas, found opened naturally at
 england, map much used. looking found in
 certain places little rings marked, examining noticed
 one near london east side, manifestly new
 estate situated; two exeter, whitby the
 yorkshire coast.
 
better part hour count returned. “aha!” he
 said; “still books? good! must work always. come; i
 informed supper ready.” took arm, went into
 next room, found excellent supper ready table. the
 count excused himself, dined away from
 home. sat previous night, chatted whilst ate.
 supper smoked, last evening, count stayed with
 me, chatting asking questions every conceivable subject, hour
 hour. felt getting late indeed, not
 say anything, felt obligation meet host’s wishes in
 every way. sleepy, long sleep yesterday fortified
 me; help experiencing chill comes one at
 coming dawn, like, way, turn tide.
 say people near death die generally change to
 dawn turn tide; one tired, and
 tied post, experienced change atmosphere
 can well believe it. heard crow cock coming up
 preternatural shrillness clear morning air; count
 dracula, jumping feet, said:--
 
“why, morning again! remiss let stay so
 long. must make conversation regarding dear new country of
 england less interesting, may forget time flies by
 us,” and, courtly bow, quickly left me.
 
went room drew curtains, little to
 notice; window opened courtyard, see the
 warm grey quickening sky. pulled curtains again, have
 written day.

_midnight._--i long talk count. asked few
 questions transylvania history, warmed subject
 wonderfully. speaking things people, especially of
 battles, spoke present all. he
 afterwards explained saying _boyar_ pride house

 spoke almost plural, like king speaking. wish put

 fascinating. seemed whole history country. he
 grew excited spoke, walked room pulling great
 white moustache grasping anything laid hands as

time close morning, went bed. (_mem._, this
 diary seems horribly like beginning “arabian nights,” for

_12 may._--let begin facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by
 books figures, can doubt. must not
 confuse experiences will rest own
 observation, memory them. last evening count came from
 room began asking questions legal matters the
 certain kinds business. spent day wearily over
 books, and, simply keep mind occupied, went the
 matters examining lincoln’s inn. certain
 method count’s inquiries, shall try put in
 sequence; knowledge may somehow time useful me.
 
first, asked man england might two solicitors more. i
 told might dozen wished, be
 wise one solicitor engaged one transaction, only
 one act time, change certain militate
 interest. seemed thoroughly understand, went to
 ask practical difficulty one man to
 attend, say, banking, another look shipping, case
 local help needed place far home banking
 solicitor. asked explain fully, might any
 chance mislead him, said:--
 
“i shall illustrate. friend mine, mr. peter hawkins, under
 shadow beautiful cathedral exeter, far from
 london, buys good self place london. good! now
 let say frankly, lest think strange have
 sought services one far london instead one
 resident there, motive local interest might be
 served save wish only; one london residence might, perhaps,
 purpose friend serve, went thus afield to
 seek agent, whose labours interest. now, suppose
 i, much affairs, wish ship goods, say, newcastle, or
 durham, harwich, dover, might more
 ease done consigning one ports?” answered that
 certainly easy, solicitors system of
 agency one other, local work done locally on
 instruction solicitor, client, simply placing
 hands one man, wishes carried by
 without trouble.
 
“but,” said he, “i liberty direct myself. so?”
 
“of course,” replied; “such often done men business, who
 like whole affairs known one person.”
 
“good!” said, went ask means making
 consignments forms gone through, sorts of
 difficulties might arise, forethought guarded
 against. explained things best ability,
 certainly left impression made a
 wonderful solicitor, nothing think or
 foresee. man never country, not
 evidently much way business, knowledge acumen were
 wonderful. satisfied points had
 spoken, verified well books
 available, suddenly stood said:--
 
“have written since first letter friend mr. peter
 hawkins, other?” bitterness heart that
 answered not, yet seen opportunity of
 sending letters anybody.
 
“then write now, young friend,” said, laying heavy hand my
 shoulder: “write friend other; say, will
 please you, shall stay month now.”
 
“do wish stay long?” asked, heart grew cold the
 thought.
 
“i desire much; nay, will take refusal. master,
 employer, will, engaged someone come behalf,
 understood needs consulted. not
 stinted. so?”
 
bow acceptance? mr. hawkins’s interest, not
 mine, think him, myself; besides, count
 dracula speaking, eyes bearing
 made remember prisoner, wished i
 choice. count saw victory bow, his
 mastery trouble face, began use them, but
 smooth, resistless way:--
 
“i pray you, good young friend, will discourse things
 business letters. will doubtless please your
 friends know well, look forward getting
 home them. so?” spoke handed three sheets of
 note-paper three envelopes. thinnest foreign
 post, looking them, him, noticing quiet smile,
 sharp, canine teeth lying red underlip, understood
 well spoken careful wrote, for
 able read it. determined write formal notes
 now, write fully mr. hawkins secret, also mina, for
 write shorthand, puzzle count, he
 see it. written two letters sat quiet, reading a
 book whilst count wrote several notes, referring wrote to
 books table. took two placed his
 own, put writing materials, which, instant door
 closed behind him, leaned looked letters, which
 face table. felt compunction so, for
 circumstances felt protect every way
 could.
 
one letters directed samuel f. billington, no. 7, the
 crescent, whitby, another herr leutner, varna; third to
 coutts & co., london, fourth herren klopstock & billreuth,
 bankers, buda-pesth. second fourth unsealed. just
 look saw door-handle move. sank back my
 seat, just time replace letters and
 resume book count, holding still another letter his
 hand, entered room. took letters table stamped
 carefully, turning me, said:--
 
“i trust will forgive me, much work private this
 evening. will, hope, find things wish.” door he
 turned, moment’s pause said:--
 
“let advise you, dear young friend--nay, let warn all
 seriousness, leave rooms will any
 chance go sleep part castle. old, has
 many memories, bad dreams sleep unwisely. be
 warned! sleep now ever overcome you, like do, then
 haste chamber rooms, rest will be
 safe. careful respect, then”--he finished his
 speech gruesome way, motioned hands were
 washing them. quite understood; doubt whether any
 dream terrible unnatural, horrible net gloom
 mystery seemed closing around me.

written diary fortunately replaced book and

 took pleasure disobeying it. sense sleep upon me,
 obstinacy sleep brings outrider. soft

 real--so real now sitting broad, full sunlight the
 morning, least believe sleep.
 
alone. room same, unchanged way since i
 came it; see along floor, brilliant moonlight,
 footsteps marked disturbed long accumulation of
 dust. moonlight opposite three young women, ladies by
 dress manner. thought time must dreaming
 saw them, for, though moonlight behind them, threw
 shadow floor. came close me, looked some
 time, whispered together. two dark, high aquiline
 noses, like count, great dark, piercing eyes seemed be
 almost red contrasted pale yellow moon. was
 fair, fair can be, great wavy masses golden hair eyes
 like pale sapphires. seemed somehow know face, know it
 connection dreamy fear, recollect the
 moment where. three brilliant white teeth shone like
 pearls ruby voluptuous lips. something
 made uneasy, longing time some
 deadly fear. felt heart wicked, burning desire would
 kiss red lips. good note down, lest some
 day meet mina’s eyes cause pain; truth.
 whispered together, three laughed--such a
 silvery, musical laugh, hard though sound never have
 come softness human lips. like intolerable,
 tingling sweetness water-glasses played cunning hand.
 fair girl shook head coquettishly, two urged her
 on. one said:--
 
“go on! first, shall follow; right to

“he young strong; kisses us all.” lay quiet,

 closed eyes languorous ecstasy waited--waited beating
 heart.
 
instant, another sensation swept quick as
 lightning. conscious presence count, his
 lapped storm fury. eyes opened involuntarily i
 saw strong hand grasp slender neck fair woman with
 giant’s power draw back, blue eyes transformed fury, the
 white teeth champing rage, fair cheeks blazing red with
 passion. count! never imagine wrath fury, even to
 demons pit. eyes positively blazing. red light
 lurid, flames hell-fire blazed behind them. his
 face deathly pale, lines hard like drawn wires;
 thick eyebrows met nose now seemed like heaving bar
 white-hot metal. fierce sweep arm, hurled woman
 him, motioned others, though beating
 back; imperious gesture seen used the
 wolves. voice which, though low almost whisper seemed to

“how dare touch him, you? dare cast eyes when
 forbidden it? back, tell all! man belongs me! beware
 meddle him, you’ll deal me.” fair girl,
 laugh ribald coquetry, turned answer him:--
 
“you never loved; never love!” women
 joined, mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang the
 room almost made faint hear; seemed like pleasure
 fiends. count turned, looking face attentively,
 said soft whisper:--
 
“yes, can love; can tell past. it
 so? well, now promise done shall
 kiss will. now go! go! must awaken him, work
 done.”
 
“are nothing to-night?” said one them, low laugh,
 pointed bag thrown upon floor, which
 moved though living thing within it. answer he
 nodded head. one women jumped forward opened it. my
 ears deceive gasp low wail, a
 half-smothered child. women closed round, whilst aghast with
 horror; looked disappeared, dreadful
 bag. door near them, passed me
 without noticing. simply seemed fade rays the

 dim, shadowy forms moment entirely faded away.
 
horror overcame me, sank unconscious.

_17 june._--this morning, sitting edge bed
 cudgelling brains, heard without cracking whips pounding
 scraping horses’ feet rocky path beyond courtyard.
 joy hurried window, saw drive yard two great
 leiter-wagons, drawn eight sturdy horses, head of
 pair slovak, wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty
 sheepskin, high boots. also long staves hand. i
 ran door, intending descend try join the
 main hall, thought way might opened them. a
 shock: door fastened outside.
 
ran window cried them. looked me
 stupidly pointed, just “hetman” szgany came out,
 seeing pointing window, said something, they
 laughed. henceforth effort mine, piteous cry agonised
 entreaty, make even look me. resolutely turned away.
 leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, handles thick
 rope; evidently empty ease slovaks
 handled them, resonance roughly moved. when
 unloaded packed great heap one corner the
 yard, slovaks given money szgany, spitting on
 luck, lazily went horse’s head. shortly afterwards, i
 heard cracking whips die away distance.
 
* * * * *
 
_24 june, morning._--last night count left early, and
 locked room. soon dared ran the
 winding stair, looked window, opened south. i
 thought watch count, something going on.
 szgany quartered somewhere castle work of
 kind. know it, now hear far-away muffled sound
 mattock spade, and, whatever is, must end some
 ruthless villainy.
 
window somewhat less half hour, saw
 something coming count’s window. drew back watched
 carefully, saw whole man emerge. new shock to
 find suit clothes worn whilst
 travelling here, slung shoulder terrible bag i
 seen women take away. doubt quest,
 garb, too! this, then, new scheme evil: will
 allow others see me, think, may leave
 evidence seen towns villages posting own
 letters, wickedness may shall local
 people attributed me.
 
makes rage think can go on, whilst shut up
 here, veritable prisoner, without protection law which
 even criminal’s right consolation.
 
thought watch count’s return, long time sat
 doggedly window. began notice some
 quaint little specks floating rays moonlight. were
 like tiniest grains dust, whirled round gathered in
 clusters nebulous sort way. watched sense of
 soothing, sort calm stole me. leaned back the
 embrasure comfortable position, enjoy more
 fully aërial gambolling.
 
something made start up, low, piteous howling dogs somewhere far
 valley, hidden sight. louder seemed to
 ring ears, floating motes dust take new shapes to
 sound danced moonlight. felt struggling to
 awake call instincts; nay, soul struggling,
 half-remembered sensibilities striving answer call. i
 becoming hypnotised! quicker quicker danced dust; the
 moonbeams seemed quiver went mass gloom
 beyond. gathered till seemed take dim phantom
 shapes. started, broad awake full possession my
 senses, ran screaming place. phantom shapes, were
 becoming gradually materialised moonbeams, the
 three ghostly women doomed. fled, felt somewhat
 safer room, moonlight lamp
 burning brightly.
 
couple hours passed heard something stirring the
 count’s room, something like sharp wail quickly suppressed; then
 silence, deep, awful silence, chilled me. a
 beating heart, tried door; locked prison, and
 nothing. sat simply cried.
 
sat heard sound courtyard without--the agonised cry a
 woman. rushed window, throwing up, peered between
 bars. there, indeed, woman dishevelled hair, holding her
 hands heart one distressed running. leaning
 corner gateway. saw face window she
 threw forward, shouted voice laden menace:--
 
“monster, give child!”
 
threw knees, raising hands, cried same
 words tones wrung heart. tore hair beat her
 breast, abandoned violences extravagant
 emotion. finally, threw forward, and, though see
 her, hear beating naked hands door.
 
somewhere high overhead, probably tower, heard voice the
 count calling harsh, metallic whisper. call seemed be
 answered far wide howling wolves. many minutes
 passed pack poured, like pent-up dam liberated,
 wide entrance courtyard.
 
cry woman, howling wolves but
 short. long streamed away singly, licking lips.
 
pity her, knew now become child, and
 better dead.
 
shall do? can do? can escape dreadful
 thing night gloom fear?
 
* * * * *
 
_25 june, morning._--no man knows till suffered night
 sweet dear heart eye morning can be. the
 sun grew high morning struck top great
 gateway opposite window, high spot touched seemed me
 dove ark lighted there. fear fell as
 vaporous garment dissolved warmth. must
 take action sort whilst courage day upon me. last
 night one post-dated letters went post, first fatal

 earth.
 
let think it. action!
 
always night-time molested or

 come safely back room. must put every detail order. i
 went whilst courage fresh straight window south

 took boots, ventured desperate way. looked down
 once, make sure sudden glimpse awful depth would
 overcome me, kept eyes away it. knew pretty
 well direction distance count’s window, made it
 well could, regard opportunities available. did
 feel dizzy--i suppose excited--and time seemed
 ridiculously short till found standing window-sill and
 trying raise sash. filled agitation, however, when
 bent slid feet foremost window. looked
 around count, but, surprise gladness, made discovery.
 room empty! barely furnished odd things, which
 seemed never used; furniture something same

 minding carefully went, stairs dark, lit
 loopholes heavy masonry. bottom dark,
 tunnel-like passage, came deathly, sickly odour, the
 odour old earth newly turned. went passage smell
 grew closer heavier. last pulled open heavy door stood
 ajar, found old, ruined chapel, evidently
 used graveyard. roof broken, two places were
 steps leading vaults, ground recently dug over, and
 earth placed great wooden boxes, manifestly been
 brought slovaks. nobody about, made search for
 outlet, none. went every inch of
 ground, lose chance. went even the
 vaults, dim light struggled, although dread to
 soul. two went, saw nothing except fragments
 old coffins piles dust; third, however, made a
 discovery.
 
there, one great boxes, fifty all, a
 pile newly dug earth, lay count! either dead asleep, i
 say which--for eyes open stony, without the

* * * * *
 
_29 june._--to-day date last letter, count has
 taken steps prove genuine, saw leave the
 castle window, clothes. went wall,
 lizard fashion, wished gun lethal weapon, might
 destroy him; fear weapon wrought alone man’s hand would
 effect him. dared wait see return, feared
 see weird sisters. came back library, read there
 till fell asleep.
 
awakened count, looked grimly man can
 look said:--
 
“to-morrow, friend, must part. return beautiful
 england, work may end may never
 meet. letter home despatched; to-morrow shall be
 here, shall ready journey. morning come the
 szgany, labours here, also come some
 slovaks. gone, carriage shall come you, shall
 bear borgo pass meet diligence bukovina to
 bistritz. hopes shall see castle
 dracula.” suspected him, determined test sincerity.
 sincerity! seems like profanation word write in
 connection monster, asked point-blank:--
 
“why may go to-night?”
 
“because, dear sir, coachman horses away mission.”
 
“but walk pleasure. want get away once.” smiled,
 soft, smooth, diabolical smile knew trick
 behind smoothness. said:--
 
“and baggage?”
 
“i care it. can send time.”
 
count stood up, said, sweet courtesy made rub my
 eyes, seemed real:--
 
“you english saying close heart, spirit is
 rules _boyars_: ‘welcome coming; speed parting
 guest.’ come me, dear young friend. hour shall wait
 house will, though sad going, that
 suddenly desire it. come!” stately gravity, he, the
 lamp, preceded stairs along hall. suddenly he
 stopped.
 
“hark!”
 
close hand came howling many wolves. almost the
 sound sprang rising hand, just music great
 orchestra seems leap bâton conductor. pause
 moment, proceeded, stately way, door, drew back
 ponderous bolts, unhooked heavy chains, began draw it
 open.
 
intense astonishment saw unlocked. suspiciously, i
 looked round, see key kind.
 
door began open, howling wolves without grew louder
 angrier; red jaws, champing teeth, blunt-clawed
 feet leaped, came opening door. knew that
 struggle moment count useless. such
 allies command, nothing. still door
 continued slowly open, count’s body stood gap.
 suddenly struck might moment means my
 doom; given wolves, instigation. there
 diabolical wickedness idea great enough count, and
 last chance cried out:--
 
“shut door; shall wait till morning!” covered face my
 hands hide tears bitter disappointment. one sweep his
 powerful arm, count threw door shut, great bolts clanged
 echoed hall shot back places.
 
silence returned library, minute two went
 room. last saw count dracula kissing hand
 me; red light triumph eyes, smile that
 judas hell might proud of.
 
room lie down, thought heard a
 whispering door. went softly listened. unless ears
 deceived me, heard voice count:--
 
“back, back, place! time yet come. wait! have
 patience! to-night mine. to-morrow night yours!” low,
 sweet ripple laughter, rage threw open door, saw
 without three terrible women licking lips. appeared they
 joined horrible laugh, ran away.
 
came back room threw knees. near
 end? to-morrow! to-morrow! lord, help me, am
 dear!
 
* * * * *
 
_30 june, morning._--these may last words ever write this
 diary. slept till just dawn, woke threw myself
 knees, determined death came find me
 ready.
 
last felt subtle change air, knew morning
 come. came welcome cock-crow, felt safe.
 glad heart, opened door ran hall. seen
 door unlocked, now escape me. hands
 trembled eagerness, unhooked chains drew back the
 massive bolts.
 
door move. despair seized me. pulled, pulled, at
 door, shook till, massive was, rattled its
 casement. see bolt shot. locked left the
 count.
 
wild desire took obtain key risk, i
 determined scale wall gain count’s
 room. might kill me, death now seemed happier choice of
 evils. without pause rushed east window, scrambled
 wall, before, count’s room. empty, that
 expected. see key anywhere, heap gold
 remained. went door corner winding
 stair along dark passage old chapel. knew now well
 enough find monster sought.
 
great box place, close wall, lid
 laid it, fastened down, nails ready their
 places hammered home. knew must reach body key, so
 raised lid, laid back wall; saw
 something filled soul horror. lay count,
 looking youth half renewed, white hair
 moustache changed dark iron-grey; cheeks fuller,
 white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; mouth redder than
 ever, lips gouts fresh blood, trickled the
 corners mouth ran chin neck. even deep,
 burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, lids pouches
 underneath bloated. seemed whole awful creature were
 simply gorged blood. lay like filthy leech, exhausted his
 repletion. shuddered bent touch him, every sense in
 revolted contact; search, lost. the
 coming night might see body banquet similar way those
 horrid three. felt body, sign find the
 key. stopped looked count. mocking smile
 bloated face seemed drive mad. i
 helping transfer london, where, perhaps, centuries come
 might, amongst teeming millions, satiate lust blood, and
 create new ever-widening circle semi-demons batten the
 helpless. thought drove mad. terrible desire came upon me
 rid world monster. lethal weapon hand,
 seized shovel workmen using fill the
 cases, lifting high, struck, edge downward, the
 hateful face. head turned, eyes fell full
 upon me, blaze basilisk horror. sight seemed to
 paralyse me, shovel turned hand glanced face,
 merely making deep gash forehead. shovel fell my
 hand across box, pulled away flange blade
 caught edge lid fell again, hid horrid
 thing sight. last glimpse bloated face,
 blood-stained fixed grin malice held its
 nethermost hell.
 
thought thought next move, brain seemed
 fire, waited despairing feeling growing me. i
 waited heard distance gipsy song sung merry voices coming
 closer, song rolling heavy wheels the
 cracking whips; szgany slovaks count had
 spoken coming. last look around box which
 contained vile body, ran place gained count’s
 room, determined rush moment door opened.
 strained ears, listened, heard downstairs grinding the
 key great lock falling back heavy door. must
 means entry, one key one of
 locked doors. came sound many feet tramping and
 dying away passage sent clanging echo. turned to
 run towards vault, might find new entrance;
 moment seemed come violent puff wind, the
 door winding stair blew shock set dust from
 lintels flying. ran push open, found was
 hopelessly fast. prisoner, net doom closing
 round closely.
 
write passage sound many tramping feet
 crash weights set heavily, doubtless boxes,
 freight earth. sound hammering; the
 box nailed down. now can hear heavy feet tramping again
 along hall, many idle feet coming behind them.
 
door shut, chains rattle; grinding key
 lock; can hear key withdraw: another door opens and
 shuts; hear creaking lock bolt.
 
hark! courtyard rocky way roll heavy wheels,
 crack whips, chorus szgany pass the
 distance.
 
alone castle awful women. faugh! mina woman,
 nought common. devils pit!
 
shall remain alone them; shall try scale castle wall
 farther yet attempted. shall take gold with
 me, lest want later. may find way dreadful place.
 
away home! away quickest nearest train! away
 cursed spot, cursed land, devil his
 children still walk earthly feet!
 
least god’s mercy better monsters, the
 precipice steep high. foot man may sleep--as man.
 good-bye, all! mina!

_24 july. whitby._--lucy met station, looking sweeter and
 lovelier ever, drove house crescent in
 rooms. lovely place. little river, the
 esk, runs deep valley, broadens comes near the
 harbour. great viaduct runs across, high piers, the
 view seems somehow away really is. valley is
 beautifully green, steep high land
 either side look right across it, unless near enough to
 see down. houses old town--the side away us--are all
 red-roofed, seem piled one anyhow, like the
 pictures see nuremberg. right town ruin whitby
 abbey, sacked danes, scene part of
 “marmion,” girl built wall. noble
 ruin, immense size, full beautiful romantic bits; is
 legend white lady seen one windows. and
 town another church, parish one, round big
 graveyard, full tombstones. mind nicest spot in
 whitby, lies right town, full view the
 harbour bay headland called kettleness
 stretches sea. descends steeply harbour that
 part bank fallen away, graves been
 destroyed. one place part stonework graves stretches
 sandy pathway far below. walks, seats beside
 them, churchyard; people go sit day long
 looking beautiful view enjoying breeze. shall come and
 sit often work. indeed, writing now, my
 book knee, listening talk three old men are
 sitting beside me. seem nothing day sit and
 talk.
 
harbour lies me, with, far side, one long granite wall
 stretching sea, curve outwards end it, in
 middle lighthouse. heavy sea-wall runs along outside
 it. near side, sea-wall makes elbow crooked inversely,
 end lighthouse. two piers a
 narrow opening harbour, suddenly widens.
 
nice high water; tide shoals away to
 nothing, merely stream esk, running between
 banks sand, rocks there. outside harbour this
 side rises half mile great reef, sharp edge of
 runs straight behind south lighthouse. end of
 buoy bell, swings bad weather, sends a
 mournful sound wind. legend ship is
 lost bells heard sea. must ask old man this; he
 coming way....

 gave double share instead. got subject legends,
 went sort sermon. must try remember it

“it fool-talk, lock, stock, barrel; that’s be, an’

“yabblins! may poorish wrong, savin’ make

 read:--
 
“edward spencelagh, master mariner, murdered pirates coast of

“who brought home, wonder, hap here? murdered coast

“well, else tombstones for? answer that, miss!”

 “mares’-tails” high sky north-west. wind then
 blowing south-west mild degree barometrical

 made report, one old fisherman, half century has
 kept watch weather signs east cliff, foretold emphatic

 wind fell away entirely evening, midnight there

shortly ten o’clock stillness air grew quite

without warning tempest broke. rapidity which, the

scenes thus revealed immeasurable grandeur of

 mouth across east pier, shock expected, men waited
 breathless. wind suddenly shifted north-east, remnant
 sea-fog melted blast; then, _mirabile dictu_, between

 gained safety harbour. searchlight followed her, a
 shudder ran saw her, lashed helm a

_9 august._--the sequel strange arrival derelict the

 possession goods consigned him. russian consul, too,

 paid harbour dues, etc. nothing talked to-day except
 strange coincidence; officials board trade been

 go along deck forward, disappear. followed cautiously,
 got bows found one, hatchways closed.

later day got together whole crew, told them, they
 evidently thought one ship, search from
 stem stern. first mate angry; said folly, yield such
 foolish ideas demoralise men; said engage keep
 trouble handspike. let take helm, the
 rest began thorough search, keeping abreast, lanterns: left
 corner unsearched. big wooden boxes, there
 odd corners man hide. men much relieved when
 search over, went back work cheerfully. first mate scowled, but
 said nothing.

_22 july_.--rough weather last three days, hands busy with

_1 august_.--two days fog, sail sighted. hoped in
 english channel able signal help get somewhere.
 power work sails, run wind. dare lower,

 working stolidly patiently, minds made worst. are

* * * * *
 
_2 august, midnight_.--woke minutes’ sleep hearing cry,
 seemingly outside port. see nothing fog. rushed deck, and
 ran mate. tells heard cry ran, sign man on
 watch. one gone. lord, help us! mate says must past straits
 dover, moment fog lifting saw north foreland, just as
 heard man cry out. now north sea, and
 god can guide us fog, seems move us; god
 seems deserted us.
 
* * * * *
 
_3 august_.--at midnight went relieve man wheel, and
 got found one there. wind steady, ran
 yawing. dared leave it, shouted the
 mate. seconds rushed deck flannels. he
 looked wild-eyed haggard, greatly fear reason given
 way. came close whispered hoarsely, mouth my
 ear, though fearing air might hear: “_it_ here; know
 it, now. watch last night saw it, like man, tall thin,
 ghastly pale. bows, looking out. crept behind
 it, gave knife; knife went it, empty the
 air.” spoke took knife drove savagely into
 space. went on: “but here, i’ll find it. the
 hold, perhaps one boxes. i’ll unscrew one one and
 see. work helm.” and, warning look finger his
 lip, went below. springing choppy wind, could
 leave helm. saw come deck tool-chest
 lantern, go forward hatchway. mad, stark,
 raving mad, it’s use trying stop him. can’t hurt those
 big boxes: invoiced “clay,” pull as
 harmless thing can do. stay, mind helm, and
 write notes. can trust god wait till fog clears.
 then, can’t steer harbour wind is, shall cut
 sails lie by, signal help....
 
* * * * *
 
nearly now. just beginning hope mate
 come calmer--for heard knocking away something the
 hold, work good him--there came hatchway sudden,
 startled scream, made blood run cold, deck he
 came shot gun--a raging madman, eyes rolling and
 face convulsed fear. “save me! save me!” cried, then
 looked round blanket fog. horror turned despair, in
 steady voice said: “you better come too, captain, is
 late. _he_ there. know secret now. will save me
 him, left!” say word, or
 move forward seize him, sprang bulwark deliberately
 threw sea. suppose know secret too, now. was
 madman got rid men one one, now has
 followed himself. god help me! account these
 horrors get port? _when_ get port! will ever be?
 
* * * * *
 
_4 august._--still fog, sunrise pierce. know is
 sunrise sailor, else know not. dared go
 below, dared leave helm; night stayed, in
 dimness night saw it--him! god forgive me, mate was
 right jump overboard. better die like man; die like a
 sailor blue water man can object. captain, must not
 leave ship. shall baffle fiend monster, shall tie
 hands wheel strength begins fail, along with
 shall tie he--it!--dare touch; then, come good
 wind foul, shall save soul, honour captain. am
 growing weaker, night coming on. can look the
 face again, may time act.... wrecked, mayhap
 bottle may found, find may understand; not,
 ... well, men shall know true trust. god
 blessed virgin saints help poor ignorant soul trying

_8 august._--lucy restless night, i, too, not
 sleep. storm fearful, boomed loudly among the
 chimney-pots, made shudder. sharp puff came seemed be
 like distant gun. strangely enough, lucy wake; got up
 twice dressed herself. fortunately, time awoke time and
 managed undress without waking her, got back bed. it
 strange thing, sleep-walking, soon will is
 thwarted physical way, intention, any,
 disappears, yields almost exactly routine her
 life.
 
early morning got went harbour see
 anything happened night. people about,
 though sun bright, air clear fresh, big,
 grim-looking waves, seemed dark foam that
 topped like snow, forced narrow mouth
 harbour--like bullying man going crowd. somehow i
 felt glad jonathan last night, land. but,
 oh, land sea? he, how? getting fearfully
 anxious him. knew do, anything!
 
* * * * *
 
_10 august._--the funeral poor sea-captain to-day most
 touching. every boat harbour seemed there, coffin
 carried captains way tate hill pier the
 churchyard. lucy came me, went early old seat, whilst
 cortège boats went river viaduct came down
 again. lovely view, saw procession nearly way.
 poor fellow laid rest quite near seat stood on
 time came saw everything. poor lucy seemed much upset.
 restless uneasy time, think that
 dreaming night telling her. quite odd one thing:
 will admit cause restlessness; if
 be, understand herself. additional
 cause poor old mr. swales found dead morning our
 seat, neck broken. evidently, doctor said,
 fallen back seat sort fright, look of
 fear horror face men said made shudder. poor
 dear old man! perhaps seen death dying eyes! lucy so
 sweet sensitive feels influences acutely other
 people do. just now quite upset little thing did
 much heed, though fond animals. one men
 came often look boats followed dog.
 dog always him. quiet persons, never saw
 man angry, heard dog bark. service dog would
 come master, seat us, kept few
 yards off, barking howling. master spoke gently, then
 harshly, angrily; neither come cease make a
 noise. sort fury, eyes savage, hairs
 bristling like cat’s tail puss war-path. finally
 man, too, got angry, jumped kicked dog, then
 took scruff neck half dragged half threw on
 tombstone seat fixed. moment touched the
 stone poor thing became quiet fell tremble. did
 try get away, crouched down, quivering cowering, was
 pitiable state terror tried, though without effect,
 comfort it. lucy full pity, too, attempt to
 touch dog, looked agonised sort way. greatly
 fear super-sensitive nature go world
 without trouble. will dreaming to-night, sure. the
 whole agglomeration things--the ship steered port dead
 man; attitude, tied wheel crucifix beads; the
 touching funeral; dog, now furious now terror--will all
 afford material dreams.
 
think will best go bed tired physically, i
 shall take long walk cliffs robin hood’s bay and
 back. much inclination sleep-walking then.

 life hers, give last drop blood body for
 her.” professor strongly humorous side, old
 knowledge detect trace origin answer:--
 
“my young sir, ask much that--not last!”
 
“what shall do?” fire eyes, open nostril
 quivered intent. helsing slapped shoulder. “come!”
 said. “you man, man want. better than
 me, better friend john.” arthur looked bewildered, the
 professor went explaining kindly way:--
 
“young miss bad, bad. wants blood, blood must have
 die. friend john consulted; perform
 call transfusion blood--to transfer full veins one to
 empty veins pine him. john give blood, is
 young strong me”--here arthur took hand wrung
 hard silence--“but, now here, good us,
 old young, toil much world thought. nerves not
 calm blood bright yours!” arthur turned him
 said:--
 
“if knew gladly die would
 understand----”
 
stopped, sort choke voice.
 
“good boy!” said helsing. “in not-so-far-off will happy
 done love. come now silent. you
 shall kiss done, must go; you
 must leave sign. say word madame; know with
 her! must shock; knowledge one. come!”
 
went lucy’s room. arthur direction remained outside.
 lucy turned head looked us, said nothing. not

 us; all. helsing took things bag laid
 little table sight. mixed narcotic, and
 coming bed, said cheerily:--
 
“now, little miss, medicine. drink off, like good
 child. see, lift swallow easy. yes.” made
 effort success.
 
astonished long drug took act. this, fact, marked
 extent weakness. time seemed endless sleep began to
 flicker eyelids. last, however, narcotic began manifest
 potency; fell deep sleep. professor was
 satisfied called arthur room, bade strip his
 coat. added: “you may take one little kiss whiles bring
 table. friend john, help me!” neither us looked whilst
 bent her.
 
helsing turning me, said:
 
“he young strong blood pure need not
 defibrinate it.”
 
swiftness, absolute method, helsing performed the
 operation. transfusion went something like life seemed come
 back poor lucy’s cheeks, arthur’s growing pallor joy
 face seemed absolutely shine. bit began grow
 anxious, loss blood telling arthur, strong man he
 was. gave idea terrible strain lucy’s system must
 undergone weakened arthur partially restored her.
 professor’s face set, stood watch hand with
 eyes fixed now patient now arthur. hear own
 heart beat. presently said soft voice: “do stir instant.
 enough. attend him; will look her.” i
 see much arthur weakened. dressed wound took his
 arm bring away, helsing spoke without turning round--the
 man seems eyes back head:--
 
“the brave lover, think, deserve another kiss, shall have

 pillow patient’s head. narrow black velvet band
 seems always wear round throat, buckled old

arthur gone went back room. lucy sleeping gently,
 breathing stronger; see counterpane move her

“what make mark throat?”
 
“what make it?”
 
“i examined yet,” answered, proceeded

“well?” said helsing.
 
“well,” said i, “i can make nothing it.” professor stood up. “i

“but, dear girl, may sleep to-night. watching you, and

“ah, can trust you!” seized opportunity, said: “i promise

“you will? oh, will really? good me. will

 back, asleep.
 
night long watched her. never stirred, slept on
 deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. lips were
 slightly parted, breast rose fell regularity a
 pendulum. smile face, evident bad
 dreams come disturb peace mind.
 
early morning maid came, left care took

“and patient?”
 
“well, left her, rather left me,” answered.
 
“come, let us see,” said. together went room.
 
blind down, went raise gently, whilst van
 helsing stepped, soft, cat-like tread, bed.
 
raised blind, morning sunlight flooded room, i
 heard professor’s low hiss inspiration, knowing rarity, a
 deadly fear shot heart. passed moved back, and
 exclamation horror, “gott himmel!” needed enforcement from
 agonised face. raised hand pointed bed, his
 iron face drawn ashen white. felt knees begin tremble.
 
bed, seemingly swoon, lay poor lucy, horribly
 white wan-looking ever. even lips white, gums
 seemed shrunken back teeth, sometimes see a
 corpse prolonged illness. helsing raised foot stamp
 anger, instinct life long years habit
 stood him, put softly. “quick!” said. “bring
 brandy.” flew dining-room, returned decanter.
 wetted poor white lips it, together rubbed palm and
 wrist heart. felt heart, moments agonising
 suspense said:--
 
“it late. beats, though feebly. work is
 undone; must begin again. young arthur now; have
 call time, friend john.” spoke, was
 dipping bag producing instruments transfusion; i
 taken coat rolled shirt-sleeve. no
 possibility opiate just present, need one; so,
 without moment’s delay, began operation. time--it did
 seem short time either, draining away one’s blood, no
 matter willingly given, terrible feeling--van helsing
 held warning finger. “do stir,” said, “but fear with
 growing strength may wake; make danger, oh, much
 danger. shall precaution take. shall give hypodermic injection
 morphia.” proceeded then, swiftly deftly, carry his
 intent. effect lucy bad, faint seemed merge
 subtly narcotic sleep. feeling personal pride
 see faint tinge colour steal back pallid
 cheeks lips. man knows, till experiences it, to
 feel life-blood drawn away veins woman loves.
 
professor watched critically. “that will do,” said. “already?”
 remonstrated. “you took great deal art.” he
 smiled sad sort smile replied:--
 
“he lover, _fiancé_. work, much work, her
 others; present will suffice.”
 
stopped operation, attended lucy, whilst applied
 digital pressure incision. laid down, whilst waited his
 leisure attend me, felt faint little sick. by-and-by
 bound wound, sent downstairs get glass wine for
 myself. leaving room, came me, half
 whispered:--
 
“mind, nothing must said this. young lover turn up
 unexpected, before, word him. frighten and
 enjealous him, too. must none. so!”
 
came back looked carefully, said:--
 
“you much worse. go room, lie sofa, and
 rest awhile; much breakfast, come me.”
 
followed orders, knew right wise were. i
 done part, now next duty keep strength. i
 felt weak, weakness lost something amazement at
 occurred. fell asleep sofa, however, wondering over
 lucy made retrograde movement, how
 drained much blood sign anywhere to
 show it. think must continued wonder dreams, for,
 sleeping waking, thoughts always came back little
 punctures throat ragged, exhausted appearance their
 edges--tiny though were.
 
lucy slept well day, woke fairly well and
 strong, though nearly much day before. helsing
 seen her, went walk, leaving charge, strict
 injunctions leave moment. hear his
 voice hall, asking way nearest telegraph office.
 
lucy chatted freely, seemed quite unconscious anything
 happened. tried keep amused interested. mother
 came see her, seem notice change whatever, but
 said gratefully:--
 
“we owe much, dr. seward, done, really
 must now take care overwork yourself. looking pale
 yourself. want wife nurse look bit; you
 do!” spoke, lucy turned crimson, though momentarily,
 poor wasted veins stand long unwonted
 drain head. reaction came excessive pallor turned
 imploring eyes me. smiled nodded, laid finger my
 lips; sigh, sank back amid pillows.
 
helsing returned couple hours, presently said me:
 “now go home, eat much drink enough. make strong. i
 stay to-night, shall sit little miss myself. and
 must watch case, must none know. grave
 reasons. no, ask them; think will. fear think
 even not-probable. good-night.”
 
hall two maids came me, asked either of
 might sit miss lucy. implored let them; and
 said dr. helsing’s wish either sit
 up, asked quite piteously intercede “foreign
 gentleman.” much touched kindness. perhaps because
 weak present, perhaps lucy’s account, that
 devotion manifested; seen
 similar instances woman’s kindness. got back time a
 late dinner; went rounds--all well; set whilst waiting
 sleep. coming.
 
* * * * *
 
_11 september._--this afternoon went hillingham. found van
 helsing excellent spirits, lucy much better. shortly had
 arrived, big parcel abroad came professor. opened it
 much impressment--assumed, course--and showed great bundle of
 white flowers.
 
“these you, miss lucy,” said.
 
“for me? oh, dr. helsing!”
 
“yes, dear, play with. medicines.” here
 lucy made wry face. “nay, take decoction or
 nauseous form, need snub charming nose, shall
 point friend arthur woes may endure seeing
 much beauty loves much distort. aha, pretty miss,
 bring nice nose straight again. medicinal, but
 know how. put window, make pretty wreath, and
 hang round neck, sleep well. oh yes! they, like the
 lotus flower, make trouble forgotten. smell like waters
 lethe, fountain youth conquistadores sought
 floridas, find late.”
 
whilst speaking, lucy examining flowers smelling
 them. now threw down, saying, half-laughter, and
 half-disgust:--
 
“oh, professor, believe putting joke me. why,
 flowers common garlic.”
 
surprise, helsing rose said sternness, his
 iron jaw set bushy eyebrows meeting:--
 
“no trifling me! never jest! grim purpose do;
 warn thwart me. take care, sake of
 others own.” seeing poor lucy scared, might
 well be, went gently: “oh, little miss, dear, fear
 me. good; much virtue so
 common flowers. see, place room. make the
 wreath wear. hush! telling others make so
 inquisitive questions. must obey, silence part obedience;
 obedience bring strong well loving arms wait
 you. now sit still awhile. come me, friend john, shall
 help deck room garlic, way haarlem,
 friend vanderpool raise herb glass-houses year.
 telegraph yesterday, here.”
 
went room, taking flowers us. professor’s
 actions certainly odd found pharmacopoeia
 ever heard of. first fastened windows latched them
 securely; next, taking handful flowers, rubbed over
 sashes, though ensure every whiff air might get
 laden garlic smell. wisp rubbed
 jamb door, above, below, side, round
 fireplace way. seemed grotesque me, and
 presently said:--
 
“well, professor, know always reason do, but
 certainly puzzles me. well sceptic here, he
 say working spell keep evil spirit.”
 
“perhaps am!” answered quietly began make wreath which
 lucy wear round neck.
 
waited whilst lucy made toilet night, she
 bed came fixed wreath garlic round her
 neck. last words said were:--
 
“take care disturb it; even room feel close, do
 to-night open window door.”
 
“i promise,” said lucy, “and thank thousand times all
 kindness me! oh, done blessed such
 friends?”
 
left house fly, waiting, helsing said:--
 
“to-night can sleep peace, sleep want--two nights travel,
 much reading day between, much anxiety day follow,
 night sit up, without wink. to-morrow morning early
 call me, come together see pretty miss, much
 strong ‘spell’ work. ho! ho!”
 
seemed confident i, remembering confidence two nights
 baneful result, felt awe vague terror. must
 weakness made hesitate tell friend, but
 felt more, like unshed tears.

dr. seward’s diary
 

_18 september._--i drove hillingham arrived early.
 keeping cab gate, went avenue alone. knocked gently
 rang quietly possible, feared disturb lucy her
 mother, hoped bring servant door. while,
 finding response, knocked rang again; still answer. cursed
 laziness servants lie abed an
 hour--for now ten o’clock--and rang knocked again, but
 impatiently, still without response. hitherto blamed only
 servants, now terrible fear began assail me. this
 desolation another link chain doom seemed drawing
 tight around us? indeed house death come, too
 late? knew minutes, even seconds delay, might mean hours of
 danger lucy, one frightful relapses;
 went round house try find chance entry
 anywhere.
 
find means ingress. every window door fastened and
 locked, returned baffled porch. so, heard the
 rapid pit-pat swiftly driven horse’s feet. stopped the
 gate, seconds later met helsing running avenue.
 saw me, gasped out:--
 
“then you, just arrived. she? late? you
 get telegram?”
 
answered quickly coherently got his
 telegram early morning, lost minute coming here,
 make one house hear me. paused and
 raised hat said solemnly:--
 
“then fear late. god’s will done!” usual
 recuperative energy, went on: “come. way open get
 in, must make one. time us now.”
 
went round back house, kitchen
 window. professor took small surgical saw case, and
 handing me, pointed iron bars guarded window. i
 attacked soon cut three them. then
 long, thin knife pushed back fastening sashes and
 opened window. helped professor in, followed him. there
 one kitchen servants’ rooms, close at
 hand. tried rooms went along, dining-room,
 dimly lit rays light shutters, found four
 servant-women lying floor. need think dead,
 stertorous breathing acrid smell laudanum the
 room left doubt condition. helsing looked at
 other, moved away said: “we can attend later.”
 ascended lucy’s room. instant two paused the
 door listen, sound hear. white
 faces trembling hands, opened door gently, entered the
 room.
 
shall describe saw? bed lay two women, lucy her
 mother. latter lay farthest in, covered white
 sheet, edge blown back draught the
 broken window, showing drawn, white face, look terror
 fixed upon it. side lay lucy, face white still more
 drawn. flowers round neck found upon her
 mother’s bosom, throat bare, showing two little wounds
 noticed before, looking horribly white mangled.
 without word professor bent bed, head almost touching
 poor lucy’s breast; gave quick turn head, one who
 listens, leaping feet, cried me:--
 
“it yet late! quick! quick! bring brandy!”
 
flew downstairs returned it, taking care smell taste
 it, lest it, too, drugged like decanter sherry found
 table. maids still breathing, restlessly, i
 fancied narcotic wearing off. stay make sure,
 returned helsing. rubbed brandy, another
 occasion, lips gums wrists palms her
 hands. said me:--
 
“i can this, can present. go wake maids.
 flick face wet towel, flick hard. make them
 get heat fire warm bath. poor soul nearly cold as
 beside her. will need heated can anything
 more.”
 
went once, found little difficulty waking three the
 women. fourth young girl, drug evidently
 affected strongly, lifted sofa let her
 sleep. others dazed first, remembrance came back to
 cried sobbed hysterical manner. stern with
 them, however, let talk. told one life
 bad enough lose, delayed sacrifice
 miss lucy. so, sobbing crying, went way, half clad
 were, prepared fire water. fortunately, kitchen and
 boiler fires still alive, lack hot water. we
 got bath carried lucy placed it. whilst
 busy chafing limbs knock hall door. one
 maids ran off, hurried clothes, opened it. then
 returned whispered us gentleman come
 message mr. holmwood. bade simply tell he
 must wait, see one now. went away message,
 and, engrossed work, clean forgot him.
 
never saw experience professor work deadly
 earnest. knew--as knew--that stand-up fight death,
 pause told so. answered way not
 understand, sternest look face wear:--
 
“if all, stop now, let fade
 away peace, see light life horizon.” went
 work with, possible, renewed frenzied vigour.
 
presently began conscious heat beginning to
 effect. lucy’s heart beat trifle audibly the
 stethoscope, lungs perceptible movement. helsing’s
 face almost beamed, lifted bath rolled in
 hot sheet dry said me:--
 
“the first gain ours! check king!”
 
took lucy another room, now prepared, laid
 bed forced drops brandy throat. noticed
 helsing tied soft silk handkerchief round throat. was
 still unconscious, quite bad as, worse than, had
 ever seen her.
 
helsing called one women, told stay her
 take eyes till returned, beckoned me
 room.
 
“we must consult done,” said descended the
 stairs. hall opened dining-room door, passed in, he
 closing door carefully behind him. shutters opened, but
 blinds already down, obedience etiquette of
 death british woman lower classes always rigidly
 observes. room was, therefore, dimly dark. was, however, light
 enough purposes. helsing’s sternness somewhat relieved
 look perplexity. evidently torturing mind about
 something, waited instant, spoke:--
 
“what now? turn help? must have
 another transfusion blood, soon, poor girl’s life
 won’t worth hour’s purchase. exhausted already; am
 exhausted too. fear trust women, even have
 courage submit. one will open his
 veins her?”
 
“what’s matter me, anyhow?”
 
voice came sofa across room, tones brought
 relief joy heart, quincey morris. van
 helsing started angrily first sound, face softened a
 glad look came eyes cried out: “quincey morris!” and
 rushed towards outstretched hands.
 
“what brought here?” cried hands met.
 
“i guess art cause.”
 
handed telegram:--
 
“have heard seward three days, terribly anxious.
 leave. father still condition. send word lucy is.
 delay.--holmwood.”
 
“i think came just nick time. know tell
 do.”
 
helsing strode forward, took hand, looking straight in
 eyes said:--
 
“a brave man’s blood best thing earth woman in
 trouble. you’re man mistake. well, devil may work against
 us he’s worth, god sends us men want them.”
 
went ghastly operation. heart
 go details. lucy got terrible shock it
 told before, though plenty blood went her
 veins, body respond treatment well other
 occasions. struggle back life something frightful see
 hear. however, action heart lungs improved, van
 helsing made subcutaneous injection morphia, before, with
 good effect. faint became profound slumber. professor watched
 whilst went downstairs quincey morris, sent one maids
 pay one cabmen waiting. left quincey lying down
 glass wine, told cook get ready good
 breakfast. thought struck me, went back room where
 lucy now was. came softly in, found helsing sheet or
 two note-paper hand. evidently read it, was
 thinking sat hand brow. look
 grim satisfaction face, one doubt solved.
 handed paper saying only: “it dropped lucy’s breast when
 carried bath.”
 
read it, stood looking professor, pause
 asked him: “in god’s name, mean? she, she,
 mad; sort horrible danger it?” bewildered i
 know say more. helsing put hand took the
 paper, saying:--
 
“do trouble now. forget present. shall know
 understand good time; will later. now what
 came say?” brought back fact, i
 again.
 
“i came speak certificate death. act
 properly wisely, may inquest, paper have
 produced. hopes need inquest, we
 surely kill poor lucy, nothing else did. know, you
 know, doctor attended knows, mrs. westenra
 disease heart, can certify died it. let us
 fill certificate once, shall take the
 registrar go undertaker.”
 
“good, oh friend john! well thought of! truly miss lucy, be
 sad foes beset her, least happy friends that
 love her. one, two, three, open veins her, besides one old
 man. ah yes, know, friend john; blind! love the
 it! now go.”
 
hall met quincey morris, telegram arthur telling him
 mrs. westenra dead; lucy also ill, now
 going better; helsing her. told him
 going, hurried out, going said:--
 
“when come back, jack, may two words to
 ourselves?” nodded reply went out. found difficulty about
 registration, arranged local undertaker come in
 evening measure coffin make arrangements.
 
got back quincey waiting me. told see him
 soon knew lucy, went room. still
 sleeping, professor seemingly moved seat her
 side. putting finger lips, gathered he
 expected wake long afraid forestalling nature.
 went quincey took breakfast-room, where
 blinds drawn down, little cheerful, or
 rather less cheerless, rooms. alone, said
 me:--
 
“jack seward, don’t want shove anywhere i’ve no
 right be; ordinary case. know loved girl
 wanted marry her; but, although that’s past gone, can’t
 help feeling anxious same. that’s wrong
 her? dutchman--and fine old fellow is; can see
 that--said, time two came room, must have
 _another_ transfusion blood, exhausted.
 now know well medical men speak _in camera_, man
 must expect know consult private. is
 common matter, and, whatever is, done part. that
 so?”
 
“that’s so,” said, went on:--
 
“i take helsing done already did
 to-day. so?”
 
“that’s so.”
 
“and guess art too. saw four days ago his
 place looked queer. seen anything pulled quick
 since pampas mare fond go grass
 night. one big bats call vampires got at
 night, gorge vein left open, there
 wasn’t enough blood let stand up, put a
 bullet lay. jack, may tell without
 betraying confidence, arthur first, so?” spoke
 poor fellow looked terribly anxious. torture suspense
 regarding woman loved, utter ignorance terrible
 mystery seemed surround intensified pain. very
 heart bleeding, took manhood him--and a
 royal lot it, too--to keep breaking down. paused before
 answering, felt must betray anything the
 professor wished kept secret; already knew much, guessed
 much, reason answering, answered
 phrase: “that’s so.”
 
“and long going on?”
 
“about ten days.”
 
“ten days! guess, jack seward, poor pretty creature
 love put veins within time blood
 four strong men. man alive, whole body wouldn’t hold it.” then,
 coming close me, spoke fierce half-whisper: “what took it
 out?”
 
shook head. “that,” said, “is crux. helsing simply
 frantic it, wits’ end. can’t even hazard guess.
 series little circumstances thrown out
 calculations lucy properly watched. shall
 occur again. stay well--or ill.” quincey held
 hand. “count in,” said. “you dutchman will tell me
 do, i’ll it.”
 
woke late afternoon, lucy’s first movement feel
 breast, and, surprise, produced paper helsing
 given read. careful professor replaced had
 come from, lest waking alarmed. eye lit van
 helsing too, gladdened. looked around room,
 seeing was, shuddered; gave loud cry, put her
 poor thin hands pale face. understood that
 meant--that realised full mother’s death; tried
 comfort her. doubtless sympathy eased somewhat, but
 low thought spirit, wept silently weakly for
 long time. told either us now remain with
 time, seemed comfort her. towards dusk fell
 doze. odd thing occurred. whilst still asleep she
 took paper breast tore two. helsing stepped
 took pieces her. same, however, went on
 action tearing, though material still her
 hands; finally lifted hands opened though scattering
 fragments. helsing seemed surprised, brows gathered as
 thought, said nothing.
 
* * * * *
 
_19 september._--all last night slept fitfully, always afraid
 sleep, something weaker woke it. professor and
 took turns watch, never left moment
 unattended. quincey morris said nothing intention, knew
 night long patrolled round round house.
 
day came, searching light showed ravages poor lucy’s
 strength. hardly able turn head, little
 nourishment take seemed good. times she
 slept, helsing noticed difference her, between
 sleeping waking. whilst asleep looked stronger, although more
 haggard, breathing softer; open mouth showed pale
 gums drawn back teeth, thus looked positively longer and
 sharper usual; woke softness eyes evidently
 changed expression, looked self, although dying
 one. afternoon asked arthur, telegraphed him.
 quincey went meet station.
 
arrived nearly six o’clock, sun setting full
 warm, red light streamed window gave more
 colour pale cheeks. saw her, arthur simply choking
 emotion, none us speak. hours passed,
 fits sleep, comatose condition passed it, had
 grown frequent, pauses conversation possible
 shortened. arthur’s presence, however, seemed act a
 stimulant; rallied little, spoke brightly she
 done since arrived. pulled together, spoke as
 cheerily could, best made everything.
 
now nearly one o’clock, helsing sitting with
 her. relieve quarter hour, entering
 lucy’s phonograph. six o’clock try rest. i
 fear to-morrow will end watching, shock too
 great; poor child rally. god help us all.

 quite still, looked round room see it
 be. see professor carried room,
 other, purpose using garlic; whole the
 window-sashes reeked it, round lucy’s neck, silk
 handkerchief helsing made keep on, rough chaplet of
 odorous flowers. lucy breathing somewhat stertorously, and
 face worst, open mouth showed pale gums. her
 teeth, dim, uncertain light, seemed longer sharper they

 canine teeth looked longer sharper rest. sat her,
 presently moved uneasily. moment came sort
 dull flapping buffeting window. went softly,
 peeped corner blind. full moonlight,
 see noise made great bat, wheeled
 round--doubtless attracted light, although dim--and every now
 struck window wings. came back seat,
 found lucy moved slightly, torn away garlic

 watching her.
 
presently woke, gave food, helsing prescribed.
 took little, languidly. seem with

 became conscious pressed garlic flowers close her. was
 certainly odd whenever got lethargic state, the
 stertorous breathing, put flowers her; she
 waked clutched close. possibility making any
 mistake this, long hours followed, many
 spells sleeping waking repeated actions many times.
 
six o’clock helsing came relieve me. arthur fallen
 doze, mercifully let sleep on. saw lucy’s face
 hear sissing indraw breath, said a
 sharp whisper: “draw blind; want light!” bent down,
 and, face almost touching lucy’s, examined carefully. he
 removed flowers lifted silk handkerchief throat. as
 started back, hear ejaculation, “mein

 noticed queer chill came me.
 
wounds throat absolutely disappeared.
 
fully five minutes helsing stood looking her, face
 sternest. turned said calmly:--
 
“she dying. will long now. will much difference, mark
 me, whether dies conscious sleep. wake poor boy, and
 let come see last; trusts us, promised him.”
 
went dining-room waked him. dazed moment, but
 saw sunlight streaming edges shutters
 thought late, expressed fear. assured lucy
 still asleep, told gently van
 helsing feared end near. covered face his
 hands, slid knees sofa, remained,
 perhaps minute, head buried, praying, whilst shoulders
 shook grief. took hand raised up. “come,” i
 said, “my dear old fellow, summon fortitude: will best
 easiest her.”
 
came lucy’s room see helsing had, with
 usual forethought, putting matters straight making
 everything look pleasing possible. even brushed lucy’s
 hair, lay pillow usual sunny ripples. we
 came room opened eyes, seeing him, whispered
 softly:--
 
“arthur! oh, love, glad come!” stooping to
 kiss her, helsing motioned back. “no,” whispered, “not
 yet! hold hand; will comfort more.”
 
arthur took hand knelt beside her, looked best,
 soft lines matching angelic beauty eyes. then
 gradually eyes closed, sank sleep. little bit her
 breast heaved softly, breath came went like tired child’s.
 
insensibly came strange change noticed in
 night. breathing grew stertorous, mouth opened, pale
 gums, drawn back, made teeth look longer sharper ever. a
 sort sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way opened eyes, which
 now dull hard once, said soft, voluptuous voice,
 never heard lips:--
 
“arthur! oh, love, glad come! kiss me!” arthur bent
 eagerly kiss her; instant helsing, who, like me,
 startled voice, swooped upon him, catching by
 neck hands, dragged back fury strength which
 never thought possessed, actually hurled almost
 across room.
 
“not life!” said; “not living soul hers!” and
 stood like lion bay.
 
arthur taken aback moment know do
 say; impulse violence seize realised
 place occasion, stood silent, waiting.
 
kept eyes fixed lucy, helsing, saw spasm as
 rage flit like shadow face; sharp teeth champed
 together. eyes closed, breathed heavily.
 
shortly opened eyes softness, and
 putting poor, pale, thin hand, took helsing’s great brown
 one; drawing her, kissed it. “my true friend,” said, a
 faint voice, untellable pathos, “my true friend, his! oh,
 guard him, give peace!”
 
“i swear it!” said solemnly, kneeling beside holding his
 hand, one registers oath. turned arthur, said
 him: “come, child, take hand yours, kiss the
 forehead, once.”
 
eyes met instead lips; parted.
 
lucy’s eyes closed; helsing, watching closely, took
 arthur’s arm, drew away.
 
lucy’s breathing became stertorous again, it
 ceased.
 
“it over,” said helsing. “she dead!”
 
took arthur arm, led away drawing-room, he
 sat down, covered face hands, sobbing way that

dr. seward’s diary--_continued_.
 

funeral arranged next succeeding day, lucy and
 mother might buried together. attended ghastly
 formalities, urbane undertaker proved staff were
 afflicted--or blessed--with something obsequious suavity.
 even woman performed last offices dead remarked to
 me, confidential, brother-professional way, come out
 death-chamber:--
 
“she makes beautiful corpse, sir. it’s quite privilege to
 attend her. it’s much say will credit our
 establishment!”
 
noticed helsing never kept far away. possible from
 disordered state things household. relatives
 hand; arthur back next day attend his
 father’s funeral, unable notify one been
 bidden. circumstances, helsing took upon
 examine papers, etc. insisted upon looking lucy’s
 papers himself. asked why, feared he, a
 foreigner, might quite aware english legal requirements, and
 might ignorance make unnecessary trouble. answered me:--
 
“i know; know. forget lawyer well doctor. but
 altogether law. knew that, avoided the
 coroner. avoid. may papers more--such
 this.”
 
spoke took pocket-book memorandum been
 lucy’s breast, torn sleep.
 
“when find anything solicitor late mrs.
 westenra, seal papers, write to-night. me, watch
 room miss lucy’s old room night, myself
 search may be. well thoughts go into
 hands strangers.”
 
went part work, another half hour found
 name address mrs. westenra’s solicitor written to
 him. poor lady’s papers order; explicit directions
 regarding place burial given. hardly sealed the
 letter, when, surprise, helsing walked room,
 saying:--
 
“can help you, friend john? free, may, service to
 you.”
 
“have got looked for?” asked, replied:--
 
“i look specific thing. hoped find, find i
 have, was--only letters memoranda, a
 diary new begun. here, shall present say
 nothing them. shall see poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with
 sanction, shall use some.”
 
finished work hand, said me:--
 
“and now, friend john, think may bed. want sleep, you
 i, rest recuperate. to-morrow shall much do, but
 to-night need us. alas!”
 
turning went look poor lucy. undertaker had
 certainly done work well, room turned small
 _chapelle ardente_. wilderness beautiful white flowers,
 death made little repulsive might be. end the
 winding-sheet laid face; professor bent and
 turned gently back, started beauty us, tall
 wax candles showing sufficient light note well. lucy’s
 loveliness come back death, hours passed,
 instead leaving traces “decay’s effacing fingers,” but
 restored beauty life, till positively believe eyes
 looking corpse.
 
professor looked sternly grave. loved had, and
 need tears eyes. said me: “remain till i
 return,” left room. came back handful wild garlic
 box waiting hall, opened, and
 placed flowers amongst others around bed. he
 took neck, inside collar, little gold crucifix, and
 placed mouth. restored sheet place, we
 came away.
 
undressing room, when, premonitory tap the
 door, entered, began speak:--
 
“to-morrow want bring me, night, set post-mortem
 knives.”
 
“must make autopsy?” asked.
 
“yes no. want operate, think. let tell you
 now, word another. want cut head take out
 heart. ah! surgeon, shocked! you, seen with
 tremble hand heart, operations life death make
 rest shudder. oh, must forget, dear friend john, that

 arthur must not; will free father’s funeral to-morrow,
 will want see her--to see _it_. then, coffined
 ready next day, shall come sleep. shall
 unscrew coffin-lid, shall operation: replace
 all, none know, save alone.”
 
“but all? girl dead. mutilate poor body
 without need? necessity post-mortem nothing
 gain it--no good her, us, science, human
 knowledge--why it? without monstrous.”
 
answer put hand shoulder, said, infinite
 tenderness:--
 
“friend john, pity poor bleeding heart; love more

 shall know, bless knowing, though pleasant
 things. john, child, friend now many years, yet
 ever know without good cause? may err--i but

“well, good reason now want do. many

 strange might well doubt. believe yet little, friend
 john. trust not, must tell think; is
 perhaps well. work--as work shall, matter trust no
 trust--without friend trust me, work heavy heart feel,
 oh! lonely want help courage may be!” paused a
 moment went solemnly: “friend john, strange and
 terrible days us. let us two, one, work to
 good end. will faith me?”
 
took hand, promised him. held door open went away,
 watched go room close door. stood without
 moving, saw one maids pass silently along passage--she had
 back towards me, see me--and go room lucy
 lay. sight touched me. devotion rare, grateful
 show unasked love. poor girl
 putting aside terrors naturally death go watch
 alone bier mistress loved, poor clay
 might lonely till laid eternal rest....

must slept long soundly, broad daylight van
 helsing waked coming room. came bedside and
 said:--
 
“you need trouble knives; shall it.”
 
“why not?” asked. solemnity night greatly
 impressed me.
 
“because,” said sternly, “it late--or early. see!” he
 held little golden crucifix. “this stolen night.”
 
“how, stolen,” asked wonder, “since now?”
 
“because get back worthless wretch stole it, the
 woman robbed dead living. punishment will surely
 come, me; knew altogether thus
 unknowing, stole. now must wait.”
 
went away word, leaving new mystery think of, a
 new puzzle grapple with.
 
forenoon dreary time, noon solicitor came: mr.
 marquand, wholeman, sons, marquand & lidderdale. genial
 appreciative done, took hands all
 cares details. lunch told us mrs. westenra for
 time expected sudden death heart, put affairs
 absolute order; informed us that, exception certain
 entailed property lucy’s father’s now, default direct
 issue, went back distant branch family, whole estate,
 real personal, left absolutely arthur holmwood. had
 told us much went on:--
 
“frankly best prevent testamentary disposition, and
 pointed certain contingencies might leave daughter either

 alliance. indeed, pressed matter far almost came into
 collision, asked us prepared carry out
 wishes. course, alternative accept. were
 right principle, ninety-nine times hundred should

 frankly, however, must admit case form of
 disposition rendered impossible carrying her

 you, dear sirs, rejoiced result, perfectly rejoiced.”
 
good fellow, rejoicing one little part--in which
 officially interested--of great tragedy, an
 object-lesson limitations sympathetic understanding.
 
remain long, said look later day and
 see lord godalming. coming, however, certain comfort to
 us, since assured us dread hostile
 criticism acts. arthur expected five o’clock, so
 little time visited death-chamber. in
 truth, now mother daughter lay it. undertaker,
 true craft, made best display goods, and
 mortuary air place lowered spirits at
 once. helsing ordered former arrangement adhered to,
 explaining that, lord godalming coming soon, be
 less harrowing feelings see left _fiancée_
 quite alone. undertaker seemed shocked stupidity and
 exerted restore things condition left them
 night before, arthur came shocks feelings
 avoid saved.
 
poor fellow! looked desperately sad broken; even stalwart
 manhood seemed shrunk somewhat strain his
 much-tried emotions. had, knew, genuinely devotedly
 attached father; lose him, time, a
 bitter blow him. warm ever, helsing he
 sweetly courteous; help seeing some
 constraint him. professor noticed it, too, motioned to
 bring upstairs. so, left door room, i
 felt like quite alone her, took arm and
 led in, saying huskily:--
 
“you loved too, old fellow; told it, was
 friend closer place heart you. don’t know to
 thank done her. can’t think yet....”
 
suddenly broke down, threw arms round shoulders and
 laid head breast, crying:--
 
“oh, jack! jack! shall do! whole life seems gone me
 once, nothing wide world live for.”
 
comforted well could. cases men need much
 expression. grip hand, tightening arm the
 shoulder, sob unison, expressions sympathy dear man’s
 heart. stood still silent till sobs died away, said
 softly him:--
 
“come look her.”
 
together moved bed, lifted lawn face.
 god! beautiful was. every hour seemed enhancing her
 loveliness. frightened amazed somewhat; arthur, he
 fell a-trembling, finally shaken doubt ague. at
 last, long pause, said faint whisper:--
 
“jack, really dead?”
 
assured sadly so, went suggest--for felt
 horrible doubt life moment longer than
 help--that often happened death faces became
 softened even resolved youthful beauty; was
 especially death preceded acute prolonged
 suffering. seemed quite away doubt, and, after
 kneeling beside couch looking lovingly and
 long, turned aside. told must good-bye, the
 coffin prepared; went back took dead hand his
 kissed it, bent kissed forehead. came away,
 fondly looking back shoulder came.
 
left drawing-room, told helsing said
 good-bye; latter went kitchen tell undertaker’s men

 came room told arthur’s question, he
 replied:--
 
“i surprised. just now doubted moment myself!”
 
dined together, see poor art trying make
 best things. helsing silent dinner-time; but
 lit cigars said--
 
“lord----”; arthur interrupted him:--
 
“no, no, that, god’s sake! yet rate. forgive me, sir:
 mean speak offensively; loss so
 recent.”
 
professor answered sweetly:--
 
“i used name doubt. must call you
 ‘mr.,’ grown love you--yes, dear boy, love you--as
 arthur.”
 
arthur held hand, took old man’s warmly.
 
“call will,” said. “i hope may always title of
 friend. let say loss words thank for
 goodness poor dear.” paused moment, went on: “i know
 understood goodness even better do; was
 rude way wanting time acted so--you remember”--the
 professor nodded--“you must forgive me.”
 
answered grave kindness:--
 
“i know hard quite trust then, trust such
 violence needs understand; take not--that you

“and, indeed, indeed, sir,” said arthur warmly, “i shall ways
 trust you. know believe noble heart, are
 jack’s friend, hers. shall like.”
 
professor cleared throat couple times, though to
 speak, finally said:--
 
“may ask something now?”
 
“certainly.”
 
“you know mrs. westenra left property?”
 
“no, poor dear; never thought it.”
 
“and yours, right deal will. i

arthur spoke heartily, like old self:--

old professor stood said solemnly:--
 
“and right. will pain us all; will be

_22 september._--in train exeter. jonathan sleeping.
 
seems yesterday last entry made, yet much
 then, whitby world me, jonathan away and
 news him; now, married jonathan, jonathan solicitor, a
 partner, rich, master business, mr. hawkins dead buried, and
 jonathan another attack may harm him. day may ask me
 it. goes. rusty shorthand--see what
 unexpected prosperity us--so may well freshen up
 exercise anyhow....
 
service simple solemn. ourselves
 servants there, one two old friends exeter, his
 london agent, gentleman representing sir john paxton, the
 president incorporated law society. jonathan stood hand in
 hand, felt best dearest friend gone us....
 
came back town quietly, taking ’bus hyde park corner.
 jonathan thought interest go row while, so
 sat down; people there, was
 sad-looking desolate see many empty chairs. made us think
 empty chair home; got walked piccadilly.
 jonathan holding arm, way used old days
 went school. felt improper, can’t go on
 years teaching etiquette decorum girls without the
 pedantry biting bit; jonathan, he
 husband, didn’t know anybody saw us--and didn’t
 care did--so walked. looking beautiful
 girl, big cart-wheel hat, sitting victoria outside guiliano’s,
 felt jonathan clutch arm tight hurt me, said
 breath: “my god!” always anxious jonathan, i
 fear nervous fit may upset again; turned him
 quickly, asked disturbed him.
 
pale, eyes seemed bulging as, half terror and
 half amazement, gazed tall, thin man, beaky nose and
 black moustache pointed beard, also observing pretty
 girl. looking hard see either us,
 good view him. face good face; was
 hard, cruel, sensual, big white teeth, looked all
 whiter lips red, pointed like animal’s.
 jonathan kept staring him, till afraid notice. i
 feared might take ill, looked fierce nasty. asked
 jonathan disturbed, answered, evidently thinking that
 knew much did: “do see is?”
 
“no, dear,” said; “i don’t know him; it?” answer seemed to
 shock thrill me, said know was
 me, mina, speaking:--
 
“it man himself!”
 
poor dear evidently terrified something--very greatly
 terrified; believe lean to
 support sunk down. kept staring; man came of
 shop small parcel, gave lady, drove
 off. dark man kept eyes fixed her, carriage
 moved piccadilly followed direction, hailed a
 hansom. jonathan kept looking him, said, himself:--
 
“i believe count, grown young. god, be
 so! oh, god! god! knew! knew!” was
 distressing much feared keep mind the
 subject asking questions, remained silent. drew him
 away quietly, he, holding arm, came easily. walked little
 further, went sat green park. was
 hot day autumn, comfortable seat shady place.
 minutes’ staring nothing, jonathan’s eyes closed, he
 went quietly sleep, head shoulder. thought it
 best thing him, disturb him. twenty
 minutes woke up, said quite cheerfully:--
 
“why, mina, asleep! oh, forgive rude.
 come, we’ll cup tea somewhere.” evidently forgotten
 dark stranger, illness forgotten that
 episode reminded of. don’t like lapsing into
 forgetfulness; may make continue injury brain. must
 ask him, fear shall harm good; must somehow
 learn facts journey abroad. time come, fear, i
 must open parcel, know written. oh, jonathan, will,
 know, forgive wrong, dear sake.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--a sad home-coming every way--the house empty dear
 soul good us; jonathan still pale dizzy slight
 relapse malady; now telegram helsing, whoever he
 may be:--
 
“you will grieved hear mrs. westenra died five days ago, and
 lucy died day yesterday. buried to-day.”
 
oh, wealth sorrow words! poor mrs. westenra! poor
 lucy! gone, gone, never return us! poor, poor arthur, have
 lost sweetness life! god help us bear our
 troubles.

 made personally. stop then, can; says
 work london may take time. poor old
 fellow! fear strain past week broken even his
 iron strength. time burial was, see, putting
 terrible restraint himself. over, were
 standing beside arthur, who, poor fellow, speaking part in
 operation blood transfused lucy’s veins; i
 see helsing’s face grow white purple turns. arthur was
 saying felt since two really married
 wife sight god. none us said word of
 operations, none us ever shall. arthur quincey went
 away together station, helsing came here. the
 moment alone carriage gave way regular fit of
 hysterics. denied since hysterics, insisted
 sense humour asserting very
 terrible conditions. laughed till cried, draw down
 blinds lest one see us misjudge; cried,
 till laughed again; laughed cried together, just woman
 does. tried stern him, one woman the
 circumstances; effect. men women different in
 manifestations nervous strength weakness! face grew
 grave stern asked mirth, time.
 reply way characteristic him, logical and
 forceful mysterious. said:--
 
“ah, don’t comprehend, friend john. think sad,
 though laugh. see, cried even laugh choke me. but
 think sorry cry, laugh come
 just same. keep always laughter knock your
 door say, ‘may come in?’ true laughter. no! a
 king, come like. ask person; choose no
 time suitability. say, ‘i here.’ behold, example grieve my
 heart sweet young girl; give blood her, though
 old worn; give time, skill, sleep; let other
 sufferers want may all. yet can laugh very
 grave--laugh clay spade sexton drop upon her
 coffin say ‘thud! thud!’ heart, till send back blood
 cheek. heart bleed poor boy--that dear boy, of
 age mine boy blessed live, his
 hair eyes same. there, know now love so. yet
 say things touch husband-heart quick, make my
 father-heart yearn man--not even you, friend
 john, level experiences father son--yet even
 moment king laugh come shout bellow ear,
 ‘here am! am!’ till blood come dance back bring of
 sunshine carry cheek. oh, friend john, is
 strange world, sad world, world full miseries, woes, and
 troubles; yet king laugh come make dance the
 tune play. bleeding hearts, dry bones churchyard, and
 tears burn fall--all dance together music he
 make smileless mouth him. believe me, friend john, that
 good come, kind. ah, men women like ropes drawn
 tight strain pull us different ways. tears come; and,
 like rain ropes, brace us up, perhaps strain
 become great, break. king laugh come like the
 sunshine, ease strain again; bear go with
 labour, may be.”
 
like wound pretending see idea; but, i
 yet understand cause laughter, asked him. he
 answered face grew stern, said quite different
 tone:--
 
“oh, grim irony all--this lovely lady garlanded with
 flowers, looked fair life, till one one wondered she
 truly dead; laid fine marble house lonely
 churchyard, rest many kin, laid mother
 loved her, loved; sacred bell going ‘toll!
 toll! toll!’ sad slow; holy men, white
 garments angel, pretending read books, yet time
 eyes never page; us bowed head. all
 what? dead; so! not?”
 
“well, life me, professor,” said, “i can’t see anything to
 laugh that. why, explanation makes harder puzzle
 before. even burial service comic, poor
 art trouble? why, heart simply breaking.”
 
“just so. said transfusion blood veins had
 made truly bride?”
 
“yes, sweet comforting idea him.”
 
“quite so. difficulty, friend john. that, then
 others? ho, ho! sweet maid polyandrist,
 me, poor wife dead me, alive church’s law, though
 wits, gone--even i, faithful husband now-no-wife,
 bigamist.”
 
“i don’t see joke comes either!” said; did
 feel particularly pleased saying things. laid
 hand arm, said:--
 
“friend john, forgive pain. showed feeling others
 wound, you, old friend, can trust.
 looked heart want laugh;
 done laugh arrived; so
 now, king laugh pack crown, him--for
 go far, far away me, long, long time--maybe would
 perhaps pity all.”
 
touched tenderness tone, asked why.
 
“because know!”
 
now scattered; many long day loneliness will
 sit roofs brooding wings. lucy lies tomb her
 kin, lordly death-house lonely churchyard, away teeming
 london; air fresh, sun rises hampstead hill,
 wild flowers grow accord.
 
can finish diary; god knows shall ever begin
 another. do, even open again, will deal with
 different people different themes; end, the
 romance life told, ere go back take thread my

“by means,” said, “read whilst order lunch; you

 fairly said wound poor lucy left becoming
 cicatrised. everything is, however, now reopened; the
 end god knows. idea helsing thinks knows,
 too, will let enough time whet curiosity. he
 went exeter yesterday, stayed night. to-day came
 back, almost bounded room half-past five o’clock,
 thrust last night’s “westminster gazette” hand.
 
“what think that?” asked stood back folded his
 arms.
 
looked paper, really know meant; he
 took pointed paragraph children decoyed

 passage described small punctured wounds throats. an
 idea struck me, looked up. “well?” said.
 
“it like poor lucy’s.”
 
“and make it?”
 
“simply cause common. whatever injured
 injured them.” quite understand answer:--
 
“that true indirectly, directly.”
 
“how mean, professor?” asked. little inclined take
 seriousness lightly--for, all, four days rest freedom
 burning, harrowing anxiety help restore one’s spirits--but
 saw face, sobered me. never, even midst our
 despair poor lucy, looked stern.
 
“tell me!” said. “i can hazard opinion. know to
 think, data found conjecture.”
 
“do mean tell me, friend john, suspicion to

 events, me?”
 
“of nervous prostration following great loss waste blood.”
 
“and blood lost waste?” shook head. stepped and
 sat beside me, went on:--
 
“you clever man, friend john; reason well, wit bold;
 prejudiced. let eyes see ears

“good god, professor!” said, starting up. “do mean tell that

 on:--
 
“can tell tortoise lives long generations of

dr. seward’s diary--_continued_.
 

sheer anger mastered me; life
 struck lucy face. smote table hard rose said to
 him:--
 
“dr. helsing, mad?” raised head looked me, and
 somehow tenderness face calmed once. “would were!” he
 said. “madness easy bear compared truth like this. oh, my
 friend, why, think you, go far round, take long tell
 simple thing? hate hated all
 life? wished give pain? wanted,
 now late, revenge time saved life, a
 fearful death? ah no!”
 
“forgive me,” said i. went on:--
 
“my friend, wished gentle breaking you,
 know loved sweet lady. even yet not
 expect believe. hard accept abstract
 truth, may doubt possible always
 believed ‘no’ it; hard still accept sad a
 concrete truth, one miss lucy. to-night go prove
 it. dare come me?”
 
staggered me. man like prove truth; byron
 excepted category, jealousy.
 
“and prove truth abhorred.”
 
saw hesitation, spoke:--
 
“the logic simple, madman’s logic time, jumping tussock
 tussock misty bog. true, proof will relief;
 worst will harm. true! ah, dread; yet
 dread help cause, need belief. come,
 tell propose: first, go now see child
 hospital. dr. vincent, north hospital, papers
 say child is, friend mine, think since were
 class amsterdam. will let two scientists see case, he
 will let two friends. shall tell nothing, we
 wish learn. then----”
 
“and then?” took key pocket held up. “and we
 spend night, i, churchyard lucy lies. is
 key lock tomb. coffin-man give to
 arthur.” heart sank within me, felt fearful
 ordeal us. nothing, however, plucked what
 heart said better hasten, afternoon was
 passing....
 
found child awake. sleep taken food, and
 altogether going well. dr. vincent took bandage its
 throat, showed us punctures. mistaking the
 similarity lucy’s throat. smaller,
 edges looked fresher; all. asked vincent he
 attributed them, replied must bite some
 animal, perhaps rat; but, part, inclined think
 one bats numerous northern
 heights london. “out many harmless ones,” said, “there may
 wild specimen south malignant species. some
 sailor may brought one home, managed escape; even from
 zoölogical gardens young one may got loose, one bred
 vampire. things occur, know. ten days ago
 wolf got out, was, believe, traced direction. a
 week after, children playing nothing red riding hood the
 heath every alley place ‘bloofer lady’ scare
 came along, since quite gala-time them. even
 poor little mite, woke to-day, asked nurse he
 might go away. asked wanted go, said wanted
 play ‘bloofer lady.’”
 
“i hope,” said helsing, “that sending child home
 will caution parents keep strict watch it. fancies
 stray dangerous; child remain another
 night, probably fatal. case suppose will
 let away days?”
 
“certainly not, week least; longer wound not
 healed.”
 
visit hospital took time reckoned on, and
 sun dipped came out. helsing saw dark it
 was, said:--
 
“there hurry. late thought. come, let us seek
 somewhere may eat, shall go way.”
 
dined “jack straw’s castle” along little crowd of
 bicyclists others genially noisy. ten o’clock we
 started inn. dark, scattered lamps
 made darkness greater outside individual
 radius. professor evidently noted road go, he
 went unhesitatingly; but, me, quite mixup to
 locality. went further, met fewer fewer people, till at
 last somewhat surprised met even patrol horse
 police going usual suburban round. last reached wall of
 churchyard, climbed over. little difficulty--for
 dark, whole place seemed strange us--we found
 westenra tomb. professor took key, opened creaky door,
 standing back, politely, quite unconsciously, motioned to
 precede him. delicious irony offer, the
 courtliness giving preference ghastly occasion. my
 companion followed quickly, cautiously drew door to, after
 carefully ascertaining lock falling, spring,
 one. latter case bad plight. he
 fumbled bag, taking matchbox piece candle,
 proceeded make light. tomb day-time, wreathed
 fresh flowers, looked grim gruesome enough; now, some
 days afterwards, flowers hung lank dead, whites
 turning rust greens browns; spider the
 beetle resumed accustomed dominance; time-discoloured
 stone, dust-encrusted mortar, rusty, dank iron, tarnished
 brass, clouded silver-plating gave back feeble glimmer a
 candle, effect miserable sordid been
 imagined. conveyed irresistibly idea life--animal life--was
 thing pass away.
 
helsing went work systematically. holding candle so
 read coffin plates, holding sperm
 dropped white patches congealed touched metal, he
 made assurance lucy’s coffin. another search bag, took
 turnscrew.
 
“what going do?” asked.
 
“to open coffin. shall yet convinced.” straightway began
 taking screws, finally lifted lid, showing the
 casing lead beneath. sight almost much me. seemed
 much affront dead have
 stripped clothing sleep whilst living; actually took
 hold hand stop him. said: “you shall see,” again
 fumbling bag, took tiny fret-saw. striking turnscrew
 lead swift downward stab, made wince, he
 made small hole, was, however, big enough admit point of
 saw. expected rush gas week-old corpse. we
 doctors, study dangers, become accustomed to
 things, drew back towards door. professor never
 stopped moment; sawed couple feet along one side of
 lead coffin, across, side. taking the
 edge loose flange, bent back towards foot the
 coffin, holding candle aperture, motioned to
 look.
 
drew near looked. coffin empty.
 
certainly surprise me, gave considerable shock, but
 helsing unmoved. now sure ever ground,
 emboldened proceed task. “are satisfied now, friend
 john?” asked.
 
felt dogged argumentativeness nature awake within as
 answered him:--
 
“i satisfied lucy’s body coffin; only
 proves one thing.”
 
“and that, friend john?”
 
“that there.”
 
“that good logic,” said, “so far goes. you--how
 can you--account there?”
 
“perhaps body-snatcher,” suggested. “some undertaker’s people
 may stolen it.” felt speaking folly, yet was
 real cause suggest. professor sighed. “ah
 well!” said, “we must proof. come me.”
 
put coffin-lid again, gathered things placed
 bag, blew light, placed candle also the
 bag. opened door, went out. behind us closed door and
 locked it. handed key, saying: “will keep it? had
 better assured.” laughed--it cheerful laugh, am
 bound say--as motioned keep it. “a key nothing,” said;
 “there may duplicates; anyhow difficult pick lock
 kind.” said nothing, put key pocket. he
 told watch one side churchyard whilst watch at
 other. took place behind yew-tree, saw dark
 figure move intervening headstones trees hid my
 sight.
 
lonely vigil. just taken place heard distant
 clock strike twelve, time came one two. chilled and
 unnerved, angry professor taking errand
 coming. cold sleepy keenly
 observant, sleepy enough betray trust altogether had
 dreary, miserable time.
 
suddenly, turned round, thought saw something like white
 streak, moving two dark yew-trees side churchyard
 farthest tomb; time dark mass moved the
 professor’s side ground, hurriedly went towards it. i
 moved; go round headstones railed-off tombs, i
 stumbled graves. sky overcast, somewhere far an
 early cock crew. little way off, beyond line scattered
 juniper-trees, marked pathway church, white, dim
 figure flitted direction tomb. tomb hidden
 trees, see figure disappeared. heard the
 rustle actual movement first seen white figure, and
 coming over, found professor holding arms tiny child. when
 saw held me, said:--
 
“are satisfied now?”
 
“no,” said, way felt aggressive.
 
“do see child?”
 
“yes, child, brought here? wounded?” i
 asked.
 
“we shall see,” said professor, one impulse took way
 churchyard, carrying sleeping child.
 
got little distance away, went clump of
 trees, struck match, looked child’s throat. was
 without scratch scar kind.
 
“was right?” asked triumphantly.
 
“we just time,” said professor thankfully.
 
now decide child, consulted
 it. take police-station to
 give account movements night; least, should
 make statement come find child.
 finally decided take heath, we
 heard policeman coming, leave fail find
 it; seek way home quickly could. fell out
 well. edge hampstead heath heard policeman’s heavy
 tramp, laying child pathway, waited watched until
 saw flashed lantern fro. heard exclamation
 astonishment, went away silently. good chance got a
 cab near “spaniards,” drove town.
 
sleep, make entry. must try get hours’
 sleep, helsing call noon. insists shall
 go another expedition.

_27 september._--it two o’clock found suitable
 opportunity attempt. funeral held noon completed,
 last stragglers mourners taken lazily
 away, when, looking carefully behind clump alder-trees, saw
 sexton lock gate him. knew safe till
 morning desire it; professor told not
 want hour most. felt horrid sense the
 reality things, effort imagination seemed of
 place; realised distinctly perils law were
 incurring unhallowed work. besides, felt useless.
 outrageous open leaden coffin, see woman dead
 nearly week really dead, now seemed height folly to
 open tomb again, knew, evidence own
 eyesight, coffin empty. shrugged shoulders, however,
 rested silent, helsing way going road,
 matter remonstrated. took key, opened vault, again
 courteously motioned precede. place gruesome as
 last night, oh, unutterably mean-looking sunshine
 streamed in. helsing walked lucy’s coffin, followed.
 bent forced back leaden flange; shock
 surprise dismay shot me.
 
lay lucy, seemingly just seen night her
 funeral. was, possible, radiantly beautiful ever; i
 believe dead. lips red, nay redder than
 before; cheeks delicate bloom.
 
“is juggle?” said him.
 
“are convinced now?” said professor response, spoke
 put hand, way made shudder, pulled back the
 dead lips showed white teeth.
 
“see,” went on, “see, even sharper before. this
 this”--and touched one canine teeth below
 it--“the little children can bitten. belief now, friend
 john?” more, argumentative hostility woke within me. _could_ not
 accept overwhelming idea suggested; so, attempt to
 argue even moment ashamed, said:--
 
“she may placed since last night.”
 
“indeed? so, whom?”
 
“i know. one done it.”
 
“and yet dead one week. peoples time not
 look so.” answer this, silent. helsing not
 seem notice silence; rate, showed neither chagrin nor
 triumph. looking intently face dead woman, raising
 eyelids looking eyes, opening lips and
 examining teeth. turned said:--
 
“here, one thing different recorded; is
 dual life common. bitten vampire
 trance, sleep-walking--oh, start; know
 that, friend john, shall know later--and trance could
 best come take blood. trance died, trance she
 un-dead, too. differ other. usually when
 un-dead sleep home”--as spoke made comprehensive sweep of
 arm designate vampire “home”--“their face show what
 are, sweet un-dead go back to
 nothings common dead. malign there, see, so
 make hard must kill sleep.” turned blood
 cold, began dawn upon accepting helsing’s
 theories; really dead, terror the
 idea killing her? looked me, evidently saw change in
 face, said almost joyously:--
 
“ah, believe now?”
 
answered: “do press hard once. willing to
 accept. will bloody work?”
 
“i shall cut head fill mouth garlic, shall
 drive stake body.” made shudder think so
 mutilating body woman loved. yet feeling
 strong expected. was, fact, beginning to
 shudder presence being, un-dead, helsing
 called it, loathe it. possible love subjective,
 objective?
 
waited considerable time helsing begin, stood as
 wrapped thought. presently closed catch bag a
 snap, said:--
 
“i thinking, made mind best. i

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_28 september._--it wonderful good night’s sleep will for
 one. yesterday almost willing accept helsing’s monstrous
 ideas; now seem start lurid outrages on
 common sense. doubt believes all. wonder his
 mind can become way unhinged. surely must _some_
 rational explanation mysterious things. possible that
 professor can done himself? abnormally clever that
 went head carry intent regard to
 fixed idea wonderful way. loath think it, indeed
 almost great marvel find van
 helsing mad; anyhow shall watch carefully. may get some
 light mystery.

_29 september, morning._.... last night, little ten o’clock,
 arthur quincey came helsing’s room; told us he
 wanted us do, especially addressing arthur, all
 wills centred his. began saying hoped would
 come too, “for,” said, “there grave duty done
 there. doubtless surprised letter?” query was
 directly addressed lord godalming.
 
“i was. rather upset bit. much trouble
 around house late without more. been
 curious, too, mean. quincey talked over; the
 talked, puzzled got, till now can say myself
 i’m tree meaning anything.”
 
“me too,” said quincey morris laconically.
 
“oh,” said professor, “then nearer beginning, of
 you, friend john here, go long way back can
 even get far begin.”
 
evident recognised return old doubting frame of
 mind without saying word. then, turning two, said
 intense gravity:--
 
“i want permission think good night. is, i
 know, much ask; know propose will
 know, then, much. therefore may ask promise me
 dark, afterwards, though may angry a
 time--i must disguise possibility may
 be--you shall blame anything.”
 
“that’s frank anyhow,” broke quincey. “i’ll answer professor.
 don’t quite see drift, swear he’s honest; that’s good
 enough me.”
 
“i thank you, sir,” said helsing proudly. “i done the
 honour counting one trusting friend, endorsement dear
 me.” held hand, quincey took.
 
arthur spoke out:--
 
“dr. helsing, don’t quite like ‘buy pig poke,’ they
 say scotland, anything honour gentleman
 faith christian concerned, make promise.
 can assure intend violate either of
 two, give consent once; though life me, i
 understand driving at.”
 
“i accept limitation,” said helsing, “and ask is
 feel necessary condemn act mine, will first
 consider well satisfied violate your
 reservations.”
 
“agreed!” said arthur; “that fair. now the
 _pourparlers_ over, may ask do?”
 
“i want come me, come secret, churchyard at
 kingstead.”
 
arthur’s face fell said amazed sort way:--
 
“where poor lucy buried?” professor bowed. arthur went on: “and
 there?”
 
“to enter tomb!” arthur stood up.
 
“professor, earnest; monstrous joke? pardon me,
 see earnest.” sat again, see that
 sat firmly proudly, one dignity. was
 silence asked again:--
 
“and tomb?”
 
“to open coffin.”
 
“this much!” said, angrily rising again. “i willing be
 patient things reasonable; this--this desecration
 grave--of one who----” fairly choked indignation. the
 professor looked pityingly him.
 
“if spare one pang, poor friend,” said, “god knows i
 would. night feet must tread thorny paths; later, and
 ever, feet love must walk paths flame!”
 
arthur looked set white face said:--
 
“take care, sir, take care!”
 
“would well hear say?” said helsing.
 “and will least know limit purpose. shall go
 on?”
 
“that’s fair enough,” broke morris.
 
pause helsing went on, evidently effort:--
 
“miss lucy dead; so? yes! can wrong to
 her. dead----”
 
arthur jumped feet.
 
“good god!” cried. “what mean? mistake; has
 buried alive?” groaned anguish even hope could
 soften.
 
“i say alive, child; think it. go no
 say might un-dead.”
 
“un-dead! alive! mean? nightmare, what
 it?”
 
“there mysteries men can guess at, age age they
 may solve part. believe me, now verge one. but
 done. may cut head dead miss lucy?”
 
“heavens earth, no!” cried arthur storm passion. “not for
 wide world will consent mutilation dead body. dr.
 helsing, try far. done should
 torture so? poor, sweet girl want to
 cast dishonour grave? mad speak things, or
 mad listen them? don’t dare think a
 desecration; shall give consent anything do. a
 duty protecting grave outrage; and, god, shall do
 it!”
 
helsing rose time seated, and
 said, gravely sternly:--
 
“my lord godalming, i, too, duty do, duty others, duty
 you, duty dead; and, god, shall it! ask you
 now come me, look listen; when
 later make request eager its
 fulfilment even am, then--then shall duty, whatever it
 may seem me. then, follow lordship’s wishes shall
 hold disposal render account you, where
 will.” voice broke little, went voice full of
 pity:--
 
“but, beseech you, go forth anger me. long life of
 acts often pleasant do, sometimes wring
 heart, never heavy task now. believe if
 time comes change mind towards me, one look from
 will wipe away sad hour, man can
 save sorrow. just think. give so
 much labour much sorrow? come land
 can good; first please friend john, and
 help sweet young lady, whom, too, came love. her--i
 ashamed say much, say kindness--i gave you
 gave; blood veins; gave it, i, not, like you, her
 lover, physician friend. gave nights
 days--before death, death; death can good
 even now, dead un-dead, shall freely.” he
 said grave, sweet pride, arthur much affected
 it. took old man’s hand said broken voice:--
 
“oh, hard think it, understand; least i
 shall go wait.”

dr. seward’s diary--_continued_
 

just quarter twelve o’clock got the
 churchyard low wall. night dark occasional gleams
 moonlight rents heavy clouds scudded across
 sky. kept somehow close together, helsing slightly
 front led way. come close tomb looked
 well arthur, feared proximity place laden so
 sorrowful memory upset him; bore well. took it
 mystery proceeding way counteractant
 grief. professor unlocked door, seeing natural
 hesitation amongst us various reasons, solved difficulty by
 entering first himself. rest us followed, closed door.
 lit dark lantern pointed coffin. arthur stepped
 forward hesitatingly; helsing said me:--
 
“you yesterday. body miss lucy that
 coffin?”
 
“it was.” professor turned rest saying:--
 
“you hear; yet one believe me.” he
 took screwdriver took lid coffin. arthur
 looked on, pale silent; lid removed stepped
 forward. evidently know leaden coffin, or,
 rate, thought it. saw rent lead,
 blood rushed face instant, quickly fell away
 again, remained ghastly whiteness; still silent.
 helsing forced back leaden flange, looked and
 recoiled.
 
coffin empty!
 
several minutes one spoke word. silence broken by
 quincey morris:--
 
“professor, answered you. word want. wouldn’t ask
 thing ordinarily--i wouldn’t dishonour imply a
 doubt; mystery goes beyond honour dishonour.
 doing?”
 
“i swear hold sacred removed nor
 touched her. happened this: two nights ago friend seward and
 came here--with good purpose, believe me. opened coffin, which
 sealed up, found it, now, empty. waited, and
 saw something white come trees. next day came in
 day-time, lay there. not, friend john?”
 
“yes.”
 
“that night just time. one small child missing,
 find it, thank god, unharmed amongst graves. yesterday came
 sundown, sundown un-dead can move. waited here
 night till sun rose, saw nothing. probable
 laid clamps doors garlic,
 un-dead bear, things shun. last
 night exodus, to-night sundown took away my
 garlic things. find coffin empty. but
 bear me. far much strange. wait me
 outside, unseen unheard, things much stranger yet be.
 so”--here shut dark slide lantern--“now outside.”
 opened door, filed out, coming last locking the
 door behind him.
 
oh! seemed fresh pure night air terror of
 vault. sweet see clouds race by, passing
 gleams moonlight scudding clouds crossing and
 passing--like gladness sorrow man’s life; sweet was
 breathe fresh air, taint death decay; how
 humanising see red lighting sky beyond hill, to
 hear far away muffled roar marks life great city. each
 way solemn overcome. arthur silent, was, i
 see, striving grasp purpose inner meaning the
 mystery. tolerably patient, half inclined to
 throw aside doubt accept helsing’s conclusions. quincey
 morris phlegmatic way man accepts things, and
 accepts spirit cool bravery, hazard to
 stake. able smoke, cut good-sized plug of
 tobacco began chew. helsing, employed a
 definite way. first took bag mass looked like
 thin, wafer-like biscuit, carefully rolled white
 napkin; next took double-handful whitish stuff, like
 dough putty. crumbled wafer fine worked the
 mass hands. took, rolling thin
 strips, began lay crevices door its
 setting tomb. somewhat puzzled this, close,
 asked doing. arthur quincey drew near
 also, curious. answered:--
 
“i closing tomb, un-dead may enter.”
 
“and stuff put going it?” asked quincey.
 “great scott! game?”
 
“it is.”
 
“what using?” time question by
 arthur. helsing reverently lifted hat answered:--
 
“the host. brought amsterdam. indulgence.” an
 answer appalled sceptical us, felt individually
 presence earnest purpose professor’s, a
 purpose thus use sacred things, was
 impossible distrust. respectful silence took places
 assigned us close round tomb, hidden sight any
 one approaching. pitied others, especially arthur. myself
 apprenticed former visits watching horror; yet i,
 hour ago repudiated proofs, felt heart sink
 within me. never tombs look ghastly white; never cypress, or
 yew, juniper seem embodiment funereal gloom; never tree
 grass wave rustle ominously; never bough creak so
 mysteriously; never far-away howling dogs send a
 woeful presage night.
 
long spell silence, big, aching void, the
 professor keen “s-s-s-s!” pointed; far avenue yews
 saw white figure advance--a dim white figure, held something
 dark breast. figure stopped, moment ray of
 moonlight fell upon masses driving clouds showed startling
 prominence dark-haired woman, dressed cerements grave.
 see face, bent saw a
 fair-haired child. pause sharp little cry, a
 child gives sleep, dog lies fire dreams. we
 starting forward, professor’s warning hand, seen us as
 stood behind yew-tree, kept us back; looked the
 white figure moved forwards again. now near enough us see
 clearly, moonlight still held. heart grew cold ice,
 hear gasp arthur, recognised features of
 lucy westenra. lucy westenra, yet changed. sweetness was
 turned adamantine, heartless cruelty, purity voluptuous
 wantonness. helsing stepped out, and, obedient gesture, we
 advanced too; four us ranged line door the
 tomb. helsing raised lantern drew slide; the
 concentrated light fell lucy’s face see lips
 crimson fresh blood, stream trickled her
 chin stained purity lawn death-robe.
 
shuddered horror. see tremulous light even
 helsing’s iron nerve failed. arthur next me, had
 seized arm held up, fallen.
 
lucy--i call thing us lucy bore her
 shape--saw us drew back angry snarl, cat gives
 taken unawares; eyes ranged us. lucy’s eyes form
 colour; lucy’s eyes unclean full hell-fire, instead of
 pure, gentle orbs knew. moment remnant love
 passed hate loathing; killed, have
 done savage delight. looked, eyes blazed unholy
 light, face became wreathed voluptuous smile. oh, god,
 made shudder see it! careless motion, flung to
 ground, callous devil, child now had
 clutched strenuously breast, growling dog growls
 bone. child gave sharp cry, lay moaning. there
 cold-bloodedness act wrung groan arthur; when
 advanced outstretched arms wanton smile fell
 back hid face hands.
 
still advanced, however, languorous, voluptuous grace,
 said:--
 
“come me, arthur. leave others come me. arms are
 hungry you. come, can rest together. come, husband, come!”
 
something diabolically sweet tones--something the
 tingling glass struck--which rang brains even us
 heard words addressed another. arthur, seemed under
 spell; moving hands face, opened wide arms. she
 leaping them, helsing sprang forward held between
 little golden crucifix. recoiled it, and, a
 suddenly distorted face, full rage, dashed past enter
 tomb.
 
within foot two door, however, stopped, if
 arrested irresistible force. turned, face was
 shown clear burst moonlight lamp, now no
 quiver helsing’s iron nerves. never see baffled
 malice face; never, trust, shall ever seen by
 mortal eyes. beautiful colour became livid, eyes seemed throw
 sparks hell-fire, brows wrinkled though folds of
 flesh coils medusa’s snakes, lovely,
 blood-stained mouth grew open square, passion masks of
 greeks japanese. ever face meant death--if looks could
 kill--we saw moment.
 
full half minute, seemed eternity, remained
 lifted crucifix sacred closing means of
 entry. helsing broke silence asking arthur:--
 
“answer me, oh friend! proceed work?”
 
arthur threw knees, hid face hands, he
 answered:--
 
“do will, friend; will. can horror like
 ever more;” groaned spirit. quincey i
 simultaneously moved towards him, took arms. hear the
 click closing lantern helsing held down; coming close
 tomb, began remove chinks sacred
 emblem placed there. looked horrified
 amazement saw, stood back, woman, corporeal
 body real moment own, pass interstice
 scarce knife-blade gone. felt glad sense of
 relief saw professor calmly restoring strings putty
 edges door.
 
done, lifted child said:
 
“come now, friends; can till to-morrow. a
 funeral noon, shall come long that. the
 friends dead will gone two, sexton lock
 gate shall remain. do; like of
 to-night. little one, much harm, to-morrow
 night shall well. shall leave police will find
 him, night; home.” coming close arthur,
 said:--
 
“my friend arthur, sore trial; after, look
 back, will see necessary. now bitter
 waters, child. time to-morrow will, please god, have
 passed them, drunk sweet waters; mourn
 overmuch. till shall ask forgive me.”
 
arthur quincey came home me, tried cheer other
 way. left child safety, tired; all
 slept less reality sleep.
 
* * * * *
 
_29 september, night._--a little twelve o’clock three--arthur,
 quincey morris, myself--called professor. odd to
 notice common consent put black clothes. of
 course, arthur wore black, deep mourning, rest of
 us wore instinct. got churchyard half-past one, and
 strolled about, keeping official observation, the
 gravediggers completed task sexton belief
 every one gone, locked gate, place to
 ourselves. helsing, instead little black bag, a
 long leather one, something like cricketing bag; manifestly of
 fair weight.
 
alone heard last footsteps die up
 road, silently, ordered intention, followed the
 professor tomb. unlocked door, entered, closing it
 behind us. took bag lantern, lit, also
 two wax candles, which, lighted, stuck, melting own
 ends, coffins, might give light sufficient work
 by. lifted lid lucy’s coffin looked--arthur
 trembling like aspen--and saw body lay its
 death-beauty. love heart, nothing but
 loathing foul thing taken lucy’s shape without her
 soul. see even arthur’s face grow hard looked. presently
 said helsing:--
 
“is really lucy’s body, demon shape?”
 
“it body, yet it. wait while, see her
 was, is.”
 
seemed like nightmare lucy lay there; pointed teeth,
 bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which made one shudder to
 see--the whole carnal unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
 devilish mockery lucy’s sweet purity. helsing, usual
 methodicalness, began taking various contents bag and
 placing ready use. first took soldering iron some
 plumbing solder, small oil-lamp, gave out, lit in
 corner tomb, gas burned fierce heat blue
 flame; operating knives, placed hand; last a
 round wooden stake, two half three inches thick about
 three feet long. one end hardened charring fire, and
 sharpened fine point. stake came heavy hammer, such
 households used coal-cellar breaking lumps. to
 me, doctor’s preparations work kind stimulating and
 bracing, effect things arthur quincey was
 cause sort consternation. both, however, kept their
 courage, remained silent quiet.
 
ready, helsing said:--
 
“before anything, let tell this; lore and
 experience ancients studied powers
 un-dead. become such, comes change the
 curse immortality; die, must go age age
 adding new victims multiplying evils world; that
 die preying un-dead becomes un-dead, prey
 kind. circle goes ever widening, like the
 ripples stone thrown water. friend arthur, met
 kiss know poor lucy die; again, last night
 open arms her, time, died,

 time make un-deads fill us horror.
 career unhappy dear lady just begun. those
 children whose blood suck yet much worse; if
 live on, un-dead, lose blood her
 power come her; draw blood that
 wicked mouth. die truth, cease; tiny
 wounds throats disappear, go back plays
 unknowing ever been. blessed all, when
 now un-dead made rest true dead, soul poor
 lady love shall free. instead working wickedness by
 night growing debased assimilating day, she
 shall take place angels. that, friend, will
 blessed hand shall strike blow sets free.
 willing; none amongst us better
 right? will joy think hereafter silence the
 night sleep not: ‘it hand sent stars; it
 hand loved best; hand would
 chosen, choose?’ tell be
 one amongst us?”
 
looked arthur. saw, too, did, infinite
 kindness suggested hand restore
 lucy us holy, unholy, memory; stepped forward and
 said bravely, though hand trembled, face pale as
 snow:--
 
“my true friend, bottom broken heart thank you. tell me
 do, shall falter!” helsing laid hand his
 shoulder, said:--
 
“brave lad! moment’s courage, done. stake must be
 driven her. will fearful ordeal--be deceived in
 that--but will short time, will rejoice more
 pain great; grim tomb will emerge though
 tread air. must falter begun. only
 think we, true friends, round you, pray for
 time.”
 
“go on,” said arthur hoarsely. “tell do.”
 
“take stake left hand, ready place point the
 heart, hammer right. begin prayer for
 dead--i shall read him, book, others shall
 follow--strike god’s name, may well dead that
 love un-dead pass away.”
 
arthur took stake hammer, mind set on
 action hands never trembled even quivered. helsing opened
 missal began read, quincey followed well we
 could. arthur placed point heart, looked could
 see dint white flesh. struck might.
 
thing coffin writhed; hideous, blood-curdling screech
 came opened red lips. body shook quivered twisted
 wild contortions; sharp white teeth champed together till the
 lips cut, mouth smeared crimson foam. arthur
 never faltered. looked like figure thor untrembling arm
 rose fell, driving deeper deeper mercy-bearing stake, whilst
 blood pierced heart welled spurted around it. his
 face set, high duty seemed shine it; sight it
 gave us courage voices seemed ring little
 vault.
 
writhing quivering body became less, the
 teeth seemed champ, face quiver. finally lay still. the
 terrible task over.
 
hammer fell arthur’s hand. reeled fallen had
 caught him. great drops sweat sprang forehead,
 breath came broken gasps. indeed awful strain
 him; forced task human
 considerations never gone it. few
 minutes taken look towards the
 coffin. did, however, murmur startled surprise ran one
 us. gazed eagerly arthur rose, had
 seated ground, came looked too; glad,
 strange light broke face dispelled altogether gloom of
 horror lay upon it.
 
there, coffin lay longer foul thing dreaded
 grown hate work destruction yielded a
 privilege one best entitled it, lucy seen in
 life, face unequalled sweetness purity. true that
 there, seen life, traces care and
 pain waste; dear us, marked truth
 knew. one felt holy calm lay like
 sunshine wasted face form earthly token and
 symbol calm reign ever.
 
helsing came laid hand arthur’s shoulder, said to
 him:--
 
“and now, arthur friend, dear lad, forgiven?”
 
reaction terrible strain came took old man’s hand
 his, raising lips, pressed it, said:--
 
“forgiven! god bless given dear one soul again,
 peace.” put hands professor’s shoulder, laying
 head breast, cried silently, whilst stood
 unmoving. raised head helsing said him:--
 
“and now, child, may kiss her. kiss dead lips will, as
 to, choose. grinning
 devil now--not foul thing eternity. longer is
 devil’s un-dead. god’s true dead, whose soul him!”
 
arthur bent kissed her, sent quincey the
 tomb; professor sawed top stake, leaving point
 body. cut head filled mouth with
 garlic. soldered leaden coffin, screwed coffin-lid,
 gathering belongings, came away. professor locked
 door gave key arthur.
 
outside air sweet, sun shone, birds sang, it
 seemed nature tuned different pitch. was
 gladness mirth peace everywhere, rest ourselves
 one account, glad, though tempered joy.
 
moved away helsing said:--
 
“now, friends, one step work done, one harrowing
 ourselves. remains greater task: find author
 sorrow stamp out. clues can
 follow; long task, difficult, danger in
 it, pain. shall help me? learned believe, all
 us--is so? since so, see duty? yes! do
 promise go bitter end?”
 
turn, took hand, promise made. said the
 professor moved off:--
 
“two nights hence shall meet dine together seven of
 clock friend john. shall entreat two others, two you
 know yet; shall ready work show plans
 unfold. friend john, come home, much consult
 about, can help me. to-night leave amsterdam, shall
 return to-morrow night. begins great quest. first i
 shall much say, may know dread.
 promise shall made anew; a
 terrible task us, feet ploughshare we
 must draw back.”

arrived berkeley hotel, helsing found telegram
 waiting him:--
 
“am coming train. jonathan whitby. important news.--mina

wire despatched cup tea; told of

crowd melted away, bustling fashion common arrival

 guest, sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped me, and,
 quick glance, said: “dr. seward, not?”
 
“and mrs. harker!” answered once; whereupon held out
 hand.
 
“i knew description poor dear lucy; but----” stopped
 suddenly, quick blush overspread face.

“you see, know pick particular part the

 unconscious simplicity, different voice, naïveté
 child: “that’s quite true, upon honour. honest indian!” could
 smile, grimaced. “i gave away time!” he
 said. “but know that, although kept diary months
 past, never struck going find particular

 made diary doctor attended lucy might have

 said boldly:--
 
“then, dr. seward, better let copy my

 give guest everything, leave free likes. all
 knew busy, stay short, mr. billington had
 ready office papers concerning consignment boxes.
 gave almost turn see one letters had
 seen count’s table knew diabolical plans.
 everything carefully thought out, done systematically and
 precision. seemed prepared every obstacle which
 might placed accident way intentions carried
 out. use americanism, “taken chances,” absolute
 accuracy instructions fulfilled, simply the
 logical result care. saw invoice, took note it:
 “fifty cases common earth, used experimental purposes.”
 also copy letter carter paterson, reply; of
 got copies. information mr. billington could
 give me, went port saw coastguards, customs
 officers harbour-master. something say the
 strange entry ship, already taking place local
 tradition; one add simple description “fifty cases

 communication men actually received boxes. their
 tally exact list, nothing add except that
 boxes “main mortal heavy,” shifting dry
 work. one added hard lines wasn’t any
 gentleman “such-like yourself, squire,” show sort of
 appreciation efforts liquid form; another put rider

 elapsed completely allayed it. needless add, took care
 leaving lift, ever adequately, source of
 reproach.

thence went carter paterson’s central office, met
 utmost courtesy. looked transaction their

 office details. good fortune, men teaming
 waiting work, official sent over, sending
 also one way-bill papers connected the

one thing now satisfied: _all_ boxes arrived at

 however, done good. never resolute, never strong, never

 hope determination; got everything order to-night. i
 feel quite wild excitement. suppose one pity any

_later._--lord godalming mr. morris arrived earlier we
 expected. dr. seward business, taken jonathan with
 him, see them. painful meeting, it
 brought back poor dear lucy’s hopes months ago. of
 course heard lucy speak me, seemed dr. van
 helsing, too, quite “blowing trumpet,” mr. morris
 expressed it. poor fellows, neither aware know all
 proposals made lucy. quite know to

“did write this, mrs. harker?”
 
nodded, went on:--
 
“i don’t quite see drift it; people good and

“i loved dear lucy, know you, to

little bit sobs ceased, raised an
 apology, though made disguise emotion. told for
 days nights past--weary days sleepless nights--he been
 unable speak one, man must speak time of
 sorrow. woman whose sympathy given him, with
 whom, owing terrible circumstance sorrow was
 surrounded, speak freely. “i know now suffered,” said,
 dried eyes, “but know even yet--and none can

 know better time; believe that, though ungrateful
 now, gratitude will grow understanding. will let be

dr. seward’s diary
 

_30 september._--i got home five o’clock, found godalming
 morris arrived, already studied transcript
 various diaries letters harker wonderful wife
 made arranged. harker yet returned visit the
 carriers’ men, dr. hennessey written me. mrs. harker gave
 us cup tea, can honestly say that, first time since i
 lived it, old house seemed like _home_. had
 finished, mrs. harker said:--
 
“dr. seward, may ask favour? want see patient, mr.
 renfield. let see him. said diary

 refuse her, possible reason should; so
 took me. went room, told man a
 lady like see him; simply answered: “why?”
 
“she going house, wants see every one it,” i
 answered. “oh, well,” said; “let come in, means; but
 just wait minute till tidy place.” method tidying was
 peculiar: simply swallowed flies spiders boxes

 held hand.
 
“good-evening, mr. renfield,” said she. “you see, know you, dr.
 seward told you.” made immediate reply, eyed all
 intently set frown face. look gave way one
 wonder, merged doubt; then, intense astonishment, he
 said:--
 
“you’re girl doctor wanted marry, you? can’t be,
 know, she’s dead.” mrs. harker smiled sweetly replied:--
 
“oh no! husband own, married ever
 saw dr. seward, me. mrs. harker.”
 
“then here?”
 
“my husband staying visit dr. seward.”
 
“then don’t stay.”
 
“but not?” thought style conversation might be
 pleasant mrs. harker, me, joined in:--
 
“how know wanted marry one?” reply simply
 contemptuous, given pause turned eyes mrs.
 harker me, instantly turning back again:--
 
“what asinine question!”
 
“i don’t see all, mr. renfield,” said mrs. harker, once
 championing me. replied much courtesy respect as
 shown contempt me:--
 
“you will, course, understand, mrs. harker, man so
 loved honoured host is, everything regarding of
 interest little community. dr. seward loved his
 household friends, even patients, who, of
 hardly mental equilibrium, apt distort causes and
 effects. since inmate lunatic asylum, i
 notice sophistic tendencies inmates
 lean towards errors _non causa_ _ignoratio elenchi_.” i
 positively opened eyes new development. pet

 with--talking elemental philosophy, manner polished

 chord memory. new phase spontaneous, any
 way due unconscious influence, must rare gift or
 power.
 
continued talk time; and, seeing seemingly
 quite reasonable, ventured, looking questioningly she
 began, lead favourite topic. astonished, for
 addressed question impartiality the
 completest sanity; even took example mentioned
 certain things.
 
“why, instance man strange belief. indeed,

 doctor?” nodded assent, amazed hardly knew to
 either think say; hard imagine seen eat up
 spiders flies five minutes before. looking watch, i
 saw go station meet helsing, told mrs.
 harker time leave. came once, saying
 pleasantly mr. renfield: “good-bye, hope may see often,
 auspices pleasanter yourself,” which, astonishment, he
 replied:--
 
“good-bye, dear. pray god may never see sweet face again.
 may bless keep you!”
 
went station meet helsing left boys behind
 me. poor art seemed cheerful since lucy first took
 ill, quincey like bright self for
 many long day.
 
helsing stepped carriage eager nimbleness a
 boy. saw once, rushed me, saying:--
 
“ah, friend john, goes all? well? so! busy, come
 stay need be. affairs settled me, have
 much tell. madam mina you? yes. fine husband? and
 arthur friend quincey, you, too? good!”
 
drove house told passed, own

“ah, wonderful madam mina! man’s brain--a brain man

 go alone.” agreed heartily him, told we
 found absence: house dracula bought was
 next one own. amazed, great concern seemed
 come him. “oh known before!” said, “for we
 might reached time save poor lucy. however, ‘the milk
 spilt cries afterwards,’ say. shall think
 that, go way end.” fell silence that
 lasted till entered gateway. went prepare for
 dinner said mrs. harker:--
 
“i told, madam mina, friend john husband have
 put exact order things been, moment.”
 
“not moment, professor,” said impulsively, “but to
 morning.”
 
“but now? seen hitherto good light the
 little things made. told secrets, yet one who
 told worse it.”
 
mrs. harker began blush, taking paper pockets, she
 said:--
 
“dr. helsing, will read this, tell must go in. it

 present everything, however trivial; little except
 personal. must go in?” professor read gravely,
 handed back, saying:--
 
“it need go wish it; pray may. can
 make husband love more, us, friends, more
 honour you--as well esteem love.” took back with
 another blush bright smile.
 
now, hour, records complete

“i answer mina myself,” said.
 
“count in, professor,” said mr. quincey morris, laconically usual.
 
“i you,” said lord godalming, “for lucy’s sake, other

dr. seward simply nodded. professor stood and, laying his
 golden crucifix table, held hand either side. took

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_1 october, 4 a. m._--just leave house, an
 urgent message brought renfield know see

“he seems importunate, sir. never seen eager. don’t

“take you, friend john,” said professor. “his case your

“may come also?” asked lord godalming.
 
“me too?” said quincey morris. “may come?” said harker. nodded, and
 went passage together.
 
found state considerable excitement, far more

 unusual understanding himself, unlike anything ever

 none others first said anything. request would

 introducing madman asylum strike moment; and,
 besides, certain dignity man’s manner, much of
 habit equality, made introduction: “lord

_1 october, evening._--i found thomas snelling house bethnal

 prospect beer expected coming opened had
 proved much, begun early expected debauch. i
 learned, however, wife, seemed decent, poor soul, he
 assistant smollet, two mates the
 responsible person. drove walworth, found mr. joseph
 smollet home shirtsleeves, taking late tea a
 saucer. decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly good, reliable
 type workman, headpiece own. remembered all
 incident boxes, wonderful dog’s-eared
 notebook, produced mysterious receptacle the
 seat trousers, hieroglyphical entries thick,
 half-obliterated pencil, gave destinations boxes. there
 were, said, six cartload took carfax left at
 197, chicksand street, mile end new town, another six he
 deposited jamaica lane, bermondsey. count meant to
 scatter ghastly refuges london, places were
 chosen first delivery, later might distribute more

 fixed far east northern shore, east southern
 shore, south. north west surely never meant to

 heart fashionable london south-west west. went back
 smollet, asked tell us boxes had
 taken carfax.
 
replied:--
 
“well, guv’nor, you’ve treated wery ’an’some”--i given half a
 sovereign--“an’ i’ll tell yer know. heard man name of
 bloxam say four nights ago ’are an’ ’ounds, pincher’s alley,
 ’ow an’ mate ’ad ’ad rare dusty job old ’ouse at

 maybe sam bloxam tell ye summut.” asked tell me
 find him. told get address it

“look ’ere, guv’nor, ain’t sense a-keepin’ ’ere. i

 can give envelope stamp it, put yer address on

 ye’d better arter ’im soon mornin’, maybe ye won’t ketch

practical, one children went penny to
 buy envelope sheet paper, keep change. she
 came back, addressed envelope stamped it, smollet had
 faithfully promised post address found, took way
 home. we’re track anyhow. tired to-night, want sleep.
 mina fast asleep, looks little pale; eyes look as

got letter bed, rose without waking mina. looked heavy
 sleepy pale, far well. determined wake her,
 that, return new search, arrange for
 going back exeter. think happier home,
 daily tasks interest her, amongst us and
 ignorance. saw dr. seward moment, told i
 to, promising come back tell rest soon should
 found anything. drove walworth found, some
 difficulty, potter’s court. mr. smollet’s spelling misled me, asked
 poter’s court instead potter’s court. however, found
 court, difficulty discovering corcoran’s lodging-house.
 asked man came door “depite,” shook his
 head, said: “i dunno ’im. ain’t person ’ere; never
 ’eard ’im bloomin’ days. don’t believe ain’t nobody
 kind livin’ ere anywheres.” took smollet’s letter, and
 read seemed lesson spelling name
 court might guide me. “what you?” asked.
 
“i’m depity,” answered. saw right
 track; phonetic spelling misled me. half-crown tip put the
 deputy’s knowledge disposal, learned mr. bloxam, who

“why, ’e took ’is end o’ boxes like pounds tea, and

 an’ shut druv off. don’t remember last time--but

“and can’t remember number house?”
 
“no, sir. ye needn’t difficulty that. it’s ’igh ’un

 went away cussin’.” thought description could
 find house, so, paid friend information, started
 piccadilly. gained new painful experience; count
 could, evident, handle earth-boxes himself. so, time was
 precious; for, now achieved certain amount of
 distribution, could, choosing time, complete task
 unobserved. piccadilly circus discharged cab, walked
 westward; beyond junior constitutional came across house
 described, satisfied next lairs
 arranged dracula. house looked though long
 untenanted. windows encrusted dust, shutters were
 up. framework black time, iron paint
 mostly scaled away. evident lately been
 large notice-board front balcony; had, however, been
 roughly torn away, uprights supported still remaining.
 behind rails balcony saw loose boards,
 whose raw edges looked white. given good deal have
 able see notice-board intact, would, perhaps, have
 given clue ownership house. remembered my
 experience investigation purchase carfax, not
 feel find former owner might means
 discovered gaining access house.
 
present nothing learned piccadilly side, and
 nothing done; went round back see anything
 gathered quarter. mews active, the
 piccadilly houses mostly occupation. asked one two the
 grooms helpers saw around tell anything
 empty house. one said heard lately been
 taken, couldn’t say whom. told me, however, to
 lately notice-board “for sale” up, that
 perhaps mitchell, sons, & candy, house agents, tell me
 something, thought remembered seeing name firm on

gentleman saw particularly suave manner, but
 uncommunicative equal proportion. told the
 piccadilly house--which throughout interview called a
 “mansion”--was sold, considered business concluded. i
 asked purchased it, opened eyes thought wider, and
 paused seconds replying:--
 
“it sold, sir.”
 
“pardon me,” said, equal politeness, “but special reason
 wishing know purchased it.”
 
paused longer, raised eyebrows still more. “it sold,
 sir,” laconic reply.
 
“surely,” said, “you mind letting know much.”
 
“but mind,” answered. “the affairs clients are
 absolutely safe hands mitchell, sons, & candy.” was
 manifestly prig first water, use arguing with
 him. thought best meet ground, said:--
 
“your clients, sir, happy resolute guardian their

 “in instance prompted curiosity; act part of
 lord godalming, wishes know something property was,

 affairs. said:--
 
“i like oblige could, mr. harker, especially would

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_1 october._--i puzzled afresh renfield. moods change so
 rapidly find difficult keep touch them, they
 always mean something well-being, form more
 interesting study. morning, went see his
 repulse helsing, manner man commanding destiny.
 was, fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. really
 care things mere earth; clouds and
 looked weaknesses wants us poor mortals. i
 thought improve occasion learn something, asked
 him:--
 
“what flies times?” smiled quite superior
 sort way--such smile become face malvolio--as
 answered me:--
 
“the fly, dear sir, one striking feature; wings typical
 aërial powers psychic faculties. ancients well
 typified soul butterfly!”
 
thought push analogy utmost logically, said
 quickly:--
 
“oh, soul now, it?” madness foiled his
 reason, puzzled look spread face as, shaking head
 decision seldom seen him, said:--
 
“oh, no, oh no! want souls. life want.” brightened
 up; “i pretty indifferent present. life right; i
 want. must get new patient, doctor, wish to
 study zoöphagy!”
 
puzzled little, drew on:--
 
“then command life; god, suppose?” smiled an
 ineffably benign superiority.
 
“oh no! far arrogate attributes the
 deity. even concerned especially spiritual doings. i
 may state intellectual position am, far concerns things
 purely terrestrial, somewhat position enoch occupied
 spiritually!” poser me. moment recall
 enoch’s appositeness; ask simple question, though felt
 lowering eyes lunatic:--
 
“and enoch?”
 
“because walked god.” see analogy, not
 like admit it; harked back denied:--
 
“so don’t care life don’t want souls. not?” put
 question quickly somewhat sternly, purpose disconcert him.
 effort succeeded; instant unconsciously relapsed his
 old servile manner, bent low me, actually fawned upon as
 replied:--
 
“i don’t want souls, indeed, indeed! don’t. couldn’t use if
 them; manner use me. couldn’t eat them
 or----” suddenly stopped old cunning look spread his
 face, like wind-sweep surface water. “and doctor, to
 life, all? you’ve got require, you
 know will never want, all. friends--good
 friends--like you, dr. seward”; said leer of
 inexpressible cunning. “i know shall never lack means of

“what souls?” evident surmise been

“i don’t want souls!” said feeble, apologetic way. the
 matter seemed preying mind, determined use it--to “be
 cruel kind.” said:--
 
“you like life, want life?”
 
“oh yes! right; needn’t worry that!”
 
“but,” asked, “how get life without getting soul
 also?” seemed puzzle him, followed up:--
 
“a nice time you’ll time you’re flying there, with

“not much! flies poor things, all!” pause added,
 “but don’t want souls buzzing round me, same.”
 
“or spiders?” went on.
 
“blow spiders! what’s use spiders? isn’t anything them
 eat or”--he stopped suddenly, though reminded forbidden
 topic.
 
“so, so!” thought myself, “this second time suddenly
 stopped word ‘drink’; mean?” renfield seemed himself
 aware made lapse, hurried on, though distract

“i don’t take stock matters. ‘rats mice such

“i don’t want elephant’s soul, soul all!” said. a

dr. seward’s diary
 

_3 october._--let put exactness happened, well
 can remember it, since last made entry. detail i
 can recall must forgotten; calmness must proceed.
 
came renfield’s room found lying floor his
 left side glittering pool blood. went move him, it
 became apparent received terrible injuries;
 seemed none unity purpose parts body
 marks even lethargic sanity. face exposed see
 horribly bruised, though beaten the
 floor--indeed face wounds pool blood
 originated. attendant kneeling beside body said as
 turned over:--
 
“i think, sir, back broken. see, right arm leg and
 whole side face paralysed.” thing have
 happened puzzled attendant beyond measure. seemed quite
 bewildered, brows gathered said:--
 
“i can’t understand two things. mark face like by
 beating head floor. saw young woman the
 eversfield asylum anyone lay hands her. suppose he
 might broke neck falling bed, got awkward
 kink. life can’t imagine two things
 occurred. back broke, couldn’t beat head; his
 face like fall bed, marks of
 it.” said him:--
 
“go dr. helsing, ask kindly come once. want
 without instant’s delay.” man ran off, within few
 minutes professor, dressing gown slippers, appeared. when
 saw renfield ground, looked keenly moment, and
 turned me. think recognised thought eyes, he
 said quietly, manifestly ears attendant:--
 
“ah, sad accident! will need careful watching, much
 attention. shall stay myself; shall first dress myself.
 will remain shall minutes join you.”
 
patient now breathing stertorously easy see that
 suffered terrible injury. helsing returned with
 extraordinary celerity, bearing surgical case. had
 evidently thinking mind made up; for, almost he
 looked patient, whispered me:--
 
“send attendant away. must alone becomes
 conscious, operation.” said:--
 
“i think will now, simmons. done can at
 present. better go round, dr. helsing will operate.
 let know instantly anything unusual anywhere.”
 
man withdrew, went strict examination patient.
 wounds face superficial; real injury depressed
 fracture skull, extending right motor area. the
 professor thought moment said:--
 
“we must reduce pressure get back normal conditions, far
 can be; rapidity suffusion shows terrible nature of
 injury. whole motor area seems affected. suffusion the
 brain will increase quickly, must trephine may be
 late.” speaking soft tapping door. i
 went opened found corridor without, arthur and
 quincey pajamas slippers: former spoke:--
 
“i heard man call dr. helsing tell accident.
 woke quincey rather called asleep. things
 moving quickly strangely sound sleep us
 times. i’ve thinking to-morrow night will see things
 been. we’ll look back--and forward little more
 done. may come in?” nodded, held door open
 till entered; closed again. quincey saw the
 attitude state patient, noted horrible pool the
 floor, said softly:--
 
“my god! happened him? poor, poor devil!” told him
 briefly, added expected recover consciousness after
 operation--for short time, events. went sat
 edge bed, godalming beside him; watched
 patience.
 
“we shall wait,” said helsing, “just long enough fix best
 spot trephining, may quickly perfectly remove
 blood clot; evident hæmorrhage increasing.”
 
minutes waited passed fearful slowness. a
 horrible sinking heart, helsing’s face gathered
 felt fear apprehension come. dreaded
 words renfield might speak. positively afraid think;
 conviction coming me, read men
 heard death-watch. poor man’s breathing came in
 uncertain gasps. instant seemed though open eyes
 speak; follow prolonged stertorous breath, he
 relapse fixed insensibility. inured sick
 beds death, suspense grew, grew upon me. almost
 hear beating heart; blood surging my
 temples sounded like blows hammer. silence finally became
 agonising. looked companions, one another, saw from
 flushed faces damp brows enduring equal
 torture. nervous suspense us all, though overhead
 dread bell peal powerfully least expect
 it.
 
last came time evident patient was
 sinking fast; might die moment. looked professor
 caught eyes fixed mine. face sternly set he
 spoke:--
 
“there time lose. words may worth many lives; have
 thinking so, stood here. may soul stake!
 shall operate just ear.”
 
without another word made operation. moments the
 breathing continued stertorous. came breath so
 prolonged seemed though tear open chest.
 suddenly eyes opened, became fixed wild, helpless stare.
 continued moments; softened glad
 surprise, lips came sigh relief. moved
 convulsively, so, said:--
 
“i’ll quiet, doctor. tell take strait-waistcoat. i
 terrible dream, left weak cannot
 move. what’s wrong face? feels swollen, smarts
 dreadfully.” tried turn head; even effort his
 eyes seemed grow glassy gently put back. van
 helsing said quiet grave tone:--
 
“tell us dream, mr. renfield.” heard voice face
 brightened, mutilation, said:--
 
“that dr. helsing. good here. give some
 water, lips dry; shall try tell you. dreamed”--he
 stopped seemed fainting, called quietly quincey--“the
 brandy--it study--quick!” flew returned glass,
 decanter brandy carafe water. moistened parched
 lips, patient quickly revived. seemed, however, poor
 injured brain working interval, for, quite
 conscious, looked piercingly agonised confusion i
 shall never forget, said:--
 
“i must deceive myself; dream, grim reality.”
 eyes roved round room; caught sight two
 figures sitting patiently edge bed went on:--
 
“if sure already, know them.” instant his
 eyes closed--not pain sleep voluntarily, though were
 bringing faculties bear; opened said,
 hurriedly, energy yet displayed:--
 
“quick, doctor, quick. dying! feel minutes;
 must go back death--or worse! wet lips brandy
 again. something must say die; poor
 crushed brain dies anyhow. thank you! night left
 me, implored let go away. couldn’t speak then, i
 felt tongue tied; sane then, except way, as
 now. agony despair long time left
 me; seemed hours. came sudden peace me. brain
 seemed become cool again, realised was. heard the
 dogs bark behind house, was!” spoke, van
 helsing’s eyes never blinked, hand came met mine and
 gripped hard. not, however, betray himself; nodded slightly
 said: “go on,” low voice. renfield proceeded:--
 
“he came window mist, seen often before;
 solid then--not ghost, eyes fierce like a
 man’s angry. laughing red mouth; sharp white
 teeth glinted moonlight turned look back belt
 trees, dogs barking. wouldn’t ask come in
 first, though knew wanted to--just wanted along.
 began promising things--not words them.” he
 interrupted word professor:--
 
“how?”
 
“by making happen; just used send flies the
 sun shining. great big fat ones steel sapphire their
 wings; big moths, night, skull cross-bones their
 backs.” helsing nodded whispered unconsciously:--
 
“the _acherontia aitetropos sphinges_--what call the
 ‘death’s-head moth’?” patient went without stopping.
 
“then began whisper: ‘rats, rats, rats! hundreds, thousands,
 millions them, every one life; dogs eat them, cats
 too. lives! red blood, years life it; merely
 buzzing flies!’ laughed him, wanted see do.
 dogs howled, away beyond dark trees house. he
 beckoned window. got looked out, raised his
 hands, seemed call without using words. dark mass
 spread grass, coming like shape flame fire; and
 moved mist right left, see there
 thousands rats eyes blazing red--like his, only
 smaller. held hand, stopped; thought he
 seemed saying: ‘all lives will give you, ay, many more
 greater, countless ages, will fall worship
 me!’ red cloud, like colour blood, seemed close
 eyes; knew doing, found opening
 sash saying him: ‘come in, lord master!’ rats were
 gone, slid room sash, though only
 open inch wide--just moon often come through
 tiniest crack stood size and
 splendour.”
 
voice weaker, moistened lips brandy again, and
 continued; seemed though memory gone working in
 interval story advanced. call him
 back point, helsing whispered me: “let go on. do
 interrupt him; go back, maybe proceed all
 lost thread thought.” proceeded:--
 
“all day waited hear him, send anything, not
 even blow-fly, moon got pretty angry him.
 slid window, though shut, even
 knock, got mad him. sneered me, white face looked
 mist red eyes gleaming, went though he
 owned whole place, one. didn’t even smell same
 went me. couldn’t hold him. thought that, somehow, mrs.
 harker come room.”
 
two men sitting bed stood came over, standing behind
 see them, hear better.
 silent, professor started quivered; face,
 however, grew grimmer sterner still. renfield went without
 noticing:--
 
“when mrs. harker came see afternoon wasn’t same;
 like tea teapot watered.” moved,
 one said word; went on:--
 
“i didn’t know till spoke; didn’t look the
 same. don’t care pale people; like lots blood
 them, seemed run out. didn’t think it
 time; went away began think, made mad
 know taking life her.” feel that
 rest quivered, did, remained otherwise still. “so when
 came to-night ready him. saw mist stealing in, i
 grabbed tight. heard madmen unnatural strength; and
 knew madman--at times anyhow--i resolved use power.
 ay, felt too, come mist struggle
 me. held tight; thought going win, didn’t
 mean take life, till saw eyes. burned
 me, strength became like water. slipped it, and
 tried cling him, raised flung down. there
 red cloud me, noise like thunder, mist seemed
 steal away door.” voice becoming fainter his
 breath stertorous. helsing stood instinctively.
 
“we know worst now,” said. “he here, know purpose.
 may late. let us armed--the other
 night, lose time; instant spare.” no
 need put fear, nay conviction, words--we shared in
 common. hurried took rooms things we
 entered count’s house. professor ready, and
 met corridor pointed significantly said:--
 
“they never leave me; shall till unhappy business is
 over. wise also, friends. common enemy deal with.
 alas! alas! dear madam mina suffer!” stopped; his
 voice breaking, know rage terror predominated in
 heart.
 
outside harkers’ door paused. art quincey held back, the
 latter said:--
 
“should disturb her?”
 
“we must,” said helsing grimly. “if door locked, shall
 break in.”
 
“may frighten terribly? unusual break lady’s
 room!”
 
helsing said solemnly, “you always right; life and
 death. chambers alike doctor; even they
 one to-night. friend john, turn handle, if
 door open, put shoulder shove; you
 too, friends. now!”
 
turned handle spoke, door yield. threw
 it; crash burst open, almost fell
 headlong room. professor actually fall, saw
 across gathered hands knees. saw
 appalled me. felt hair rise like bristles back neck,
 heart seemed stand still.
 
moonlight bright thick yellow blind room
 light enough see. bed beside window lay jonathan
 harker, face flushed breathing heavily though stupor.
 kneeling near edge bed facing outwards white-clad
 figure wife. side stood tall, thin man, clad black.
 face turned us, instant saw recognised
 count--in every way, even scar forehead. left
 hand held mrs. harker’s hands, keeping away arms
 full tension; right hand gripped back neck,
 forcing face bosom. white nightdress smeared
 blood, thin stream trickled man’s bare breast which
 shown torn-open dress. attitude two terrible
 resemblance child forcing kitten’s nose saucer milk to
 compel drink. burst room, count turned his
 face, hellish look heard described seemed leap
 it. eyes flamed red devilish passion; great nostrils
 white aquiline nose opened wide quivered edge; the
 white sharp teeth, behind full lips blood-dripping mouth,
 champed together like wild beast. wrench, threw
 victim back upon bed though hurled height, turned
 sprang us. time professor gained feet,
 holding towards envelope contained sacred
 wafer. count suddenly stopped, just poor lucy done outside
 tomb, cowered back. back cowered, we,
 lifting crucifixes, advanced. moonlight suddenly failed, a
 great black cloud sailed across sky; gaslight sprang up
 quincey’s match, saw nothing faint vapour. this, we
 looked, trailed door, recoil bursting
 open, swung back old position. helsing, art, moved
 forward mrs. harker, time drawn breath with
 given scream wild, ear-piercing, despairing it
 seems now will ring ears till dying day. a
 seconds lay helpless attitude disarray. face was
 ghastly, pallor accentuated blood smeared
 lips cheeks chin; throat trickled thin stream of
 blood; eyes mad terror. put face her
 poor crushed hands, bore whiteness red mark the
 count’s terrible grip, behind came low desolate wail
 made terrible scream seem quick expression an
 endless grief. helsing stepped forward drew coverlet gently
 body, whilst art, looking face instant
 despairingly, ran room. helsing whispered me:--
 
“jonathan stupor know vampire can produce. can
 nothing poor madam mina moments till recovers
 herself; must wake him!” dipped end towel cold water
 began flick face, wife while
 holding face hands sobbing way was
 heart-breaking hear. raised blind, looked the
 window. much moonshine; looked see quincey
 morris run across lawn hide shadow great
 yew-tree. puzzled think this; the
 instant heard harker’s quick exclamation woke partial
 consciousness, turned bed. face, might well
 be, look wild amazement. seemed dazed seconds, and
 full consciousness seemed burst upon once, he
 started up. wife aroused quick movement, turned to
 arms stretched out, though embrace him; instantly,
 however, drew again, putting elbows together, held
 hands face, shuddered till bed beneath shook.
 
“in god’s name mean?” harker cried out. “dr. seward, dr.
 helsing, it? happened? wrong? mina, dear,
 it? blood mean? god, god! come to
 this!” and, raising knees, beat hands wildly
 together. “good god help us! help her! oh, help her!” quick
 movement jumped bed, began pull clothes,--all the
 man awake need instant exertion. “what happened?
 tell it!” cried without pausing. “dr. helsing, you
 love mina, know. oh, something save her. gone too
 far yet. guard look _him_!” wife, terror
 horror distress, saw sure danger him: instantly
 forgetting grief, seized hold cried out:--
 
“no! no! jonathan, must leave me. suffered enough
 to-night, god knows, without dread harming you. must stay
 me. stay friends will watch you!” her
 expression became frantic spoke; and, yielding her, she
 pulled sitting bed side, clung fiercely.
 
helsing tried calm both. professor held his
 little golden crucifix, said wonderful calmness:--
 
“do fear, dear. here; whilst close no
 foul thing can approach. safe to-night; must calm
 take counsel together.” shuddered silent, holding down
 head husband’s breast. raised it, white
 night-robe stained blood lips touched, where
 thin open wound neck sent forth drops. instant she
 saw drew back, low wail, whispered, amidst choking
 sobs:--
 
“unclean, unclean! must touch kiss more. oh, it
 now worst enemy, may have
 cause fear.” spoke resolutely:--
 
“nonsense, mina. shame hear word. not
 hear you; shall hear you. may god judge my
 deserts, punish bitter suffering even hour,
 act will mine anything ever come us!” put out
 arms folded breast; lay there

jonathan harker’s journal
 

_3 october._--as must something go mad, write diary. it
 now six o’clock, meet study half hour and
 take something eat; dr. helsing dr. seward agreed
 eat work best. best will be, god
 knows, required to-day. must keep writing every chance, dare
 stop think. all, big little, must go down; perhaps end
 little things may teach us most. teaching, big little, could
 landed mina anywhere worse to-day. however,
 must trust hope. poor mina told just now, tears
 running dear cheeks, trouble trial our
 faith tested--that must keep trusting; god will aid us
 end. end! oh god! end?... work! work!
 
dr. helsing dr. seward come back seeing poor
 renfield, went gravely done. first, dr. seward
 told us dr. helsing gone room below
 found renfield lying floor, heap. face was
 bruised crushed in, bones neck broken.
 
dr. seward asked attendant duty passage had
 heard anything. said sitting down--he confessed to
 half dozing--when heard loud voices room, renfield
 called loudly several times, “god! god! god!” there
 sound falling, entered room found lying
 floor, face down, just doctors seen him. helsing
 asked heard “voices” “a voice,” said not
 say; first seemed two, as
 one room one. swear
 it, required, word “god” spoken patient. dr.
 seward said us, alone, wish go into
 matter; question inquest considered, it
 never put forward truth, one believe it. as
 was, thought attendant’s evidence give a
 certificate death misadventure falling bed. case the
 coroner demand it, formal inquest, necessarily
 result.
 
question began discussed next
 step, first thing decided mina full
 confidence; nothing sort--no matter painful--should be
 kept her. agreed wisdom, pitiful
 see brave yet sorrowful, depth of
 despair. “there must concealment,” said, “alas! had
 much already. besides nothing world can
 give pain already endured--than suffer now!
 whatever may happen, must new hope new courage me!”
 helsing looking fixedly spoke, said, suddenly
 quietly:--
 
“but dear madam mina, afraid; yourself, for
 others yourself, happened?” face grew set its
 lines, eyes shone devotion martyr she
 answered:--
 
“ah no! mind made up!”
 
“to what?” asked gently, whilst still; in
 way sort vague idea meant. answer
 came direct simplicity, though simply stating fact:--
 
“because find myself--and shall watch keenly it--a sign of
 harm love, shall die!”
 
“you kill yourself?” asked, hoarsely.
 
“i would; friend loved me, save a
 pain, desperate effort!” looked meaningly she
 spoke. sitting down; now rose came close and
 put hand head said solemnly:
 
“my child, one good. i
 hold account god find euthanasia you,
 even moment best. nay, safe! my
 child----” moment seemed choked, great sob rose his
 throat; gulped went on:--
 
“there stand death. must not
 die. must die hand; least own. until
 other, fouled sweet life, true dead must not
 die; still quick un-dead, death make
 even is. no, must live! must struggle strive to
 live, though death seem boon unspeakable. must fight death
 himself, though come pain joy; day, the
 night; safety peril! living soul charge you
 die--nay, think death--till great evil past.” the
 poor dear grew white death, shock shivered, seen a
 quicksand shake shiver incoming tide. all
 silent; nothing. length grew calm turning to
 said, sweetly, oh! sorrowfully, held hand:--
 
“i promise you, dear friend, god will let live, shall
 strive so; till, may good time, horror may

 hearts strengthened work endure her, we
 began discuss do. told all

 might hereafter use; keep record done before.

usual helsing thought ahead everyone else, was
 prepared exact ordering work.
 
“it perhaps well,” said, “that meeting visit to
 carfax decided anything earth-boxes lay
 there. done so, count must guessed purpose, and
 doubtless taken measures advance frustrate an
 effort regard others; now know our
 intentions. nay, more, probability, know a

 contain thought minutes seconds so
 preciously laden mina’s life happiness flying us,
 since whilst talked action impossible. helsing held up
 hand warningly. “nay, friend jonathan,” said, “in this, the
 quickest way home longest way, proverb say. shall all

“then let us come once,” cried, “we wasting precious,

“and get house piccadilly?”
 
“any way!” cried. “we shall break need be.”
 
“and police; will be, will say?”
 
staggered; knew wished delay good
 reason it. said, quietly could:--
 
“don’t wait need be; know, sure, torture am
 in.”
 
“ah, child, do; indeed wish add to
 anguish. just think, can do, world at
 movement. will come time. thought thought, it
 seems simplest way best all. now wish get
 house, key; so?” nodded.
 
“now suppose were, truth, owner house, could
 still get in; think conscience the
 housebreaker, do?”
 
“i get respectable locksmith, set work pick the
 lock me.”
 
“and police, interfere, not?”
 
“oh, no! knew man properly employed.”
 
“then,” looked keenly spoke, “all doubt is
 conscience employer, belief policemen to
 whether employer good conscience bad one. your
 police must indeed zealous men clever--oh, clever!--in reading

see right terrible despair mina’s
 face became relaxed thought; hope good counsel. van
 helsing went on:--
 
“when within house may find clues; rate of

lord godalming stood up. “i can use here,” said. “i shall

“friend quincey right!” said professor. “his head you

mina took growing interest everything rejoiced see

 going concerned, said intended stay protect

 listen objection. said might law matter

 resolution fixed; said last hope _her_ that

 wishes it, guard well alone one present.” i
 started crying out: “then god’s name let us come once, we
 losing time. count may come piccadilly earlier we
 think.”
 
“not so!” said helsing, holding hand.
 
“but why?” asked.
 
“do forget,” said, actually smile, “that last night he
 banqueted heavily, will sleep late?”
 
forget! shall ever--can ever! can us ever forget that
 terrible scene! mina struggled hard keep brave countenance; but
 pain overmastered put hands face, and
 shuddered whilst moaned. helsing intended recall her
 frightful experience. simply lost sight part in
 affair intellectual effort. struck said,
 horrified thoughtlessness tried comfort her. “oh,
 madam mina,” said, “dear, dear madam mina, alas! so
 reverence said anything forgetful. stupid old
 lips mine stupid old head deserve so; will
 forget it, will not?” bent low beside spoke; took
 hand, looking tears, said hoarsely:--
 
“no, shall forget, well remember; i

 him. “then well. now, madam mina, case _quite_ safe

fearful scream almost froze hearts hear. he
 placed wafer mina’s forehead, seared it--had burned
 flesh though piece white-hot metal. poor
 darling’s brain told significance fact quickly as
 nerves received pain it; two overwhelmed that
 overwrought nature voice dreadful scream. the
 words thought came quickly; echo scream ceased
 ring air came reaction, sank her
 knees floor agony abasement. pulling beautiful hair
 face, leper old mantle, wailed out:--
 
“unclean! unclean! even almighty shuns polluted flesh! must
 bear mark shame upon forehead judgment day.” they
 paused. thrown beside agony helpless
 grief, putting arms around held tight. minutes our
 sorrowful hearts beat together, whilst friends around us turned away
 eyes ran tears silently. helsing turned said
 gravely; gravely help feeling some
 way inspired, stating things outside himself:--
 
“it may may bear mark till god see fit,

hope words, comfort; made resignation.

dr. seward’s diary
 

_3 october._--the time seemed terribly long whilst waiting for
 coming godalming quincey morris. professor tried keep
 minds active using time. see beneficent
 purpose, side glances threw time time harker.
 poor fellow overwhelmed misery appalling see.
 last night frank, happy-looking man, strong, youthful
 face, full energy, dark brown hair. to-day drawn,
 haggard old man, whose white hair matches well hollow burning
 eyes grief-written lines face. energy still intact; in
 fact, like living flame. may yet salvation, for, if
 go well, will tide despairing period; will then,
 kind way, wake realities life. poor fellow, i
 thought trouble bad enough, his----! professor knows
 well enough, best keep mind active. he
 saying was, circumstances, absorbing interest. so
 well can remember, is:--
 
“i studied, since came hands, all
 papers relating monster; studied, the
 greater seems necessity utterly stamp out. there
 signs advance; power, knowledge of
 it. learned researches friend arminus buda-pesth,
 life wonderful man. soldier, statesman, and
 alchemist--which latter highest development the
 science-knowledge time. mighty brain, learning beyond
 compare, heart knew fear remorse. dared even to
 attend scholomance, branch knowledge time
 essay. well, brain powers survived the
 physical death; though seem memory complete.
 faculties mind been, is, child; is
 growing, things childish first now of
 man’s stature. experimenting, well; not
 crossed path yet--he may yet we
 fail--the father furtherer new order beings, whose road must
 lead death, life.”
 
harker groaned said, “and arrayed darling!
 experimenting? knowledge may help us defeat him!”
 
“he along, since coming, trying power, slowly but
 surely; big child-brain working. well us, is, as
 yet, child-brain; dared, first, attempt certain
 things long ago beyond power. however, means
 succeed, man centuries can afford wait
 go slow. _festina lente_ may well motto.”
 
“i fail understand,” said harker wearily. “oh, plain to
 me! perhaps grief trouble dulling brain.”
 
professor laid hand tenderly shoulder spoke:--
 
“ah, child, will plain. see how, late, this
 monster creeping knowledge experimentally. been
 making use zoöphagous patient effect entry friend
 john’s home; vampire, though afterwards can come when
 will, must first make entry asked thereto by
 inmate. important experiments. not
 see first great boxes moved others. he
 knew must so. time great
 child-brain growing, began consider whether he
 might move box. began help; then, he
 found all-right, try move alone. he
 progress, scatter graves him; none know where
 hidden. may intend bury deep ground. so
 use night, time can change his
 form, equal well; none may know his
 hiding-place! but, child, despair; knowledge come him
 just late! already lairs one sterilise him;
 sunset shall so. place he
 can move hide. delayed morning might sure. is
 stake us him? even
 careful him? clock one hour already, be
 well, friend arthur quincey way us. to-day our
 day, must go sure, slow, lose chance. see! are
 five us absent ones return.”
 
whilst speaking startled knock hall door, the
 double postman’s knock telegraph boy. moved the
 hall one impulse, helsing, holding hand us to
 keep silence, stepped door opened it. boy handed a
 despatch. professor closed door again, and, looking the
 direction, opened read aloud.
 
“look d. just now, 12:45, come carfax hurriedly and
 hastened towards south. seems going round may want
 see you: mina.”
 
pause, broken jonathan harker’s voice:--
 
“now, god thanked, shall soon meet!” helsing turned him
 quickly said:--
 
“god will act way time. fear, rejoice
 yet; wish moment may undoings.”
 
“i care nothing now,” answered hotly, “except wipe this
 brute face creation. sell soul it!”
 
“oh, hush, hush, child!” said helsing. “god purchase
 souls wise; devil, though may purchase, keep
 faith. god merciful just, knows pain your
 devotion dear madam mina. think you, pain be
 doubled, hear wild words. fear us, are
 devoted cause, to-day shall see end. time is
 coming action; to-day vampire limit powers man,
 till sunset may change. will take time arrive
 here--see, twenty minutes past one--and yet times
 can hither come, never quick. must hope for
 lord arthur quincey arrive first.”
 
half hour received mrs. harker’s telegram, there
 came quiet, resolute knock hall door. just ordinary
 knock, given hourly thousands gentlemen, made
 professor’s heart mine beat loudly. looked other, and
 together moved hall; held ready use various
 armaments--the spiritual left hand, mortal right. van
 helsing pulled back latch, and, holding door half open, stood
 back, hands ready action. gladness hearts
 must shown upon faces step, close door, we
 saw lord godalming quincey morris. came quickly closed
 door behind them, former saying, moved along the
 hall:--
 
“it right. found places; six boxes we
 destroyed all!”
 
“destroyed?” asked professor.
 
“for him!” silent minute, quincey said:--
 
“there’s nothing wait here. if, however, doesn’t turn up
 five o’clock, must start off; won’t leave mrs. harker
 alone sunset.”
 
“he will long now,” said helsing, been
 consulting pocket-book. “_nota bene_, madam’s telegram went
 south carfax, means went cross river, could
 slack tide, something one
 o’clock. went south meaning us. yet only
 suspicious; went carfax first place would
 suspect interference least. must bermondsey a
 short time him. already shows went to
 mile end next. took time; be
 carried river way. believe me, friends, shall not
 long wait now. ready plan attack, that
 may throw away chance. hush, time now. your
 arms! ready!” held warning hand spoke, could
 hear key softly inserted lock hall door.
 
admire, even moment, way a
 dominant spirit asserted itself. hunting parties and
 adventures different parts world, quincey morris always

 accustomed obey implicitly. now, old habit seemed be
 renewed instinctively. swift glance around room, once
 laid plan attack, and, without speaking word, a
 gesture, placed us position. helsing, harker, were
 just behind door, opened professor could
 guard whilst two stepped incomer door.
 godalming behind quincey front stood just sight ready to
 move front window. waited suspense made the
 seconds pass nightmare slowness. slow, careful steps came along
 hall; count evidently prepared surprise--at least
 feared it.
 
suddenly single bound leaped room, winning way past

 panther-like movement--something unhuman, seemed
 sober us shock coming. first act was
 harker, who, quick movement, threw door
 leading room front house. count saw us, a
 horrible sort snarl passed face, showing eye-teeth long
 pointed; evil smile quickly passed cold stare of
 lion-like disdain. expression changed as, single
 impulse, advanced upon him. pity some
 better organised plan attack, even moment wondered what
 do. know whether lethal weapons would
 avail us anything. harker evidently meant try matter, had
 ready great kukri knife made fierce sudden cut him. the
 blow powerful one; diabolical quickness count’s
 leap back saved him. second less trenchant blade shorne

 making wide gap whence bundle bank-notes stream gold

 moment feared harker, though saw throw terrible knife
 aloft another stroke. instinctively moved forward a
 protective impulse, holding crucifix wafer left hand. i
 felt mighty power fly along arm; without surprise i
 saw monster cower back similar movement made spontaneously
 one us. impossible describe expression of
 hate baffled malignity--of anger hellish rage--which came over
 count’s face. waxen hue became greenish-yellow contrast
 burning eyes, red scar forehead showed the
 pallid skin like palpitating wound. next instant, sinuous
 dive swept harker’s arm, ere blow fall, and, grasping
 handful money floor, dashed across room, threw
 window. amid crash glitter falling glass,

“you think baffle me, you--with pale faces row, like

 girls love mine already; and
 others shall yet mine--my creatures, bidding my

 quickly door, heard rusty bolt creak he
 fastened behind him. door beyond opened shut. first us
 speak professor, as, realising difficulty following
 stable, moved toward hall.
 
“we learnt something--much! notwithstanding brave words, he
 fears us; fear time, fear want! not, hurry so? his
 tone betray him, ears deceive. take money? you

godalming morris rushed yard, harker had

 bolted stable door; time forced open there

now late afternoon, sunset far off. to

 professor said:--
 
“let us go back madam mina--poor, poor dear madam mina. can do

sad hearts came back house, found mrs. harker
 waiting us, appearance cheerfulness honour her
 bravery unselfishness. saw faces, became as
 pale death: second two eyes closed were

“i can never thank enough. oh, poor darling!” spoke,
 took husband’s grey head hands kissed it--“lay your
 poor head rest it. will yet well, dear! god will protect

 place words sublime misery.
 
sort perfunctory supper together, think cheered us
 somewhat. was, perhaps, mere animal heat food hungry
 people--for none us eaten anything since breakfast--or sense
 companionship may helped us; anyhow less
 miserable, saw morrow altogether without hope. true to
 promise, told mrs. harker everything passed; and
 although grew snowy white times danger seemed to
 threaten husband, red others devotion was
 manifested, listened bravely calmness. came the
 part harker rushed count recklessly, clung to
 husband’s arm, held tight though clinging could
 protect harm might come. said nothing, however,
 till narration done, matters brought right up
 present time. without letting go husband’s hand she
 stood amongst us spoke. oh, give idea the
 scene; sweet, sweet, good, good woman radiant beauty
 youth animation, red scar forehead, which
 conscious, saw grinding our
 teeth--remembering whence came; loving kindness against
 grim hate; tender faith fears doubting; and
 we, knowing far symbols went, goodness and
 purity faith, outcast god.
 
“jonathan,” said, word sounded like music lips was
 full love tenderness, “jonathan dear, true,
 true friends, want bear something mind this
 dreadful time. know must fight--that must destroy even as
 destroyed false lucy true lucy might live hereafter;

“i will go,” said, hurried professor’s room.
 
two three minutes later helsing room his

“where you?” answer came neutral way:--
 
“i know. sleep place can call own.” several
 minutes silence. mina sat rigid, professor stood
 staring fixedly; rest us hardly dared breathe. room
 growing lighter; without taking eyes mina’s face, dr. van

“what doing?”
 
“i still--oh, still. like death!” voice faded away into

_5 october, 5 p. m._--our meeting report. present: professor van
 helsing, lord godalming, dr. seward, mr. quincey morris, jonathan
 harker, mina harker.
 
dr. helsing described steps taken day to
 discover boat whither bound count dracula made escape:--
 
“as knew wanted get back transylvania, felt sure that

 nevertheless tell us things want know.
 
“they make known us among them, last afternoon five

 might close hand ship might purchase ship
 forms, departed.
 
“no one knew went ‘or bloomin’ well cared,’ said, for
 something else think of--well blood again; soon
 became apparent _czarina catherine_ sail as
 expected. thin mist began creep river, grew,

 captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot bloom and
 blood; nothing. water rose rose; began to
 fear lose tide altogether. friendly mood,
 just full tide, thin man came gang-plank and
 asked see box stowed. captain replied
 wished box--old much bloom and

 picturesque, questioning mariners movement up

 went ebb tide; doubtless morning far the

“and so, dear madam mina, rest time, for

 surely go others went. answered growing passion,
 first quietly. went on, however, grew angry more
 forceful, till end see wherein least some
 personal dominance made long master amongst

 sat around table, eyes opened wonder whether
 whole past days dream. i
 caught sight red blotch mrs. harker’s forehead was
 brought back reality. even now, gravely revolving the
 matter, almost impossible realise cause our
 trouble still existent. even mrs. harker seems lose sight her
 trouble whole spells; now again, something
 recalls mind, thinks terrible scar. to

 cannot, give utterance. mentioned helsing, and
 talk alone. suppose of

 count purposes gave helsing called “the

 good things; age existence ptomaines is
 mystery wonder anything! one thing know: my

 terrible difficulty--an unknown danger--in work us. same
 power compels silence may compel speech. dare think
 further; thoughts dishonour noble woman!
 
helsing coming study little others. shall
 try open subject him.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--when professor came in, talked state of
 things. see something mind wanted to
 say, felt hesitancy broaching subject. beating
 bush little, said suddenly:--
 
“friend john, something must talk alone, just
 first rate. later, may take others our
 confidence”; stopped, waited; went on:--
 
“madam mina, poor, dear madam mina changing.” cold shiver ran
 find worst fears thus endorsed. helsing
 continued:--
 
“with sad experience miss lucy, must time warned

 thought pain might inflict upon poor

 effect expected.
 
now close time general gathering. helsing has
 gone away prepare meeting, painful part it. i

* * * * *
 
_later._--at outset meeting great personal relief was
 experienced helsing myself. mrs. harker sent a
 message husband say join us present, as
 thought better free discuss movements
 without presence embarrass us. professor looked each
 instant, somehow seemed relieved. own
 part, thought mrs. harker realised danger herself, was
 much pain well much danger averted. circumstances we
 agreed, questioning look answer, finger lip, to
 preserve silence suspicions, able to
 confer alone again. went plan campaign. van
 helsing roughly put facts us first:--
 
“the _czarina catherine_ left thames yesterday morning. will take
 quickest speed ever made least three weeks to
 reach varna; can travel overland place three days.
 now, allow two days less ship’s voyage, owing such
 weather influences know count can bring bear; if
 allow whole day night delays may occur us,
 margin nearly two weeks. thus, order quite
 safe, must leave 17th latest. shall rate
 varna day ship arrives, able make such
 preparations may necessary. course shall go armed--armed
 evil things, spiritual well physical.” quincey morris
 added:--
 
“i understand count comes wolf country, may be

 trouble sort around. remember, art, pack
 us tobolsk? wouldn’t given repeater

“good!” said helsing, “winchesters shall be. quincey’s head is

 can nothing here; think varna familiar of
 us, go soon? long wait there.
 to-night to-morrow can get ready, then, well, we
 four can set journey.”
 
“we four?” said harker interrogatively, looking one another of
 us.
 
“of course!” answered professor quickly, “you must remain take
 care sweet wife!” harker silent awhile said
 hollow voice:--
 
“let us talk part morning. want consult with
 mina.” thought now time helsing warn not
 disclose plans her; took notice. looked him
 significantly coughed. answer put finger lips and
 turned away.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_5 october, afternoon._--for time meeting morning i
 think. new phases things leave mind state of
 wonder allows room active thought. mina’s determination not
 take part discussion set thinking; not
 argue matter her, guess. far ever from
 solution now. way others received it, too, puzzled me; the
 last time talked subject agreed no
 concealment anything amongst us. mina sleeping now, calmly
 sweetly like little child. lips curved face beams
 happiness. thank god, moments still her.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--how strange is. sat watching mina’s happy sleep, and
 came near happy suppose shall ever be. the
 evening drew on, earth took shadows sun sinking
 lower, silence room grew solemn me. at
 mina opened eyes, looking tenderly, said:--

dr. seward’s diary
 

_11 october, evening._--jonathan harker asked note this, he
 says hardly equal task, wants exact record kept.
 
think none us surprised asked see mrs.
 harker little time sunset. late come to
 understand sunrise sunset times peculiar freedom;
 old self can manifest without controlling force subduing
 restraining her, inciting action. mood condition
 begins half hour actual sunrise sunset, lasts
 till either sun high, whilst clouds still aglow with
 rays streaming horizon. first sort of
 negative condition, tie loosened, absolute
 freedom quickly follows; when, however, freedom ceases the
 change-back relapse comes quickly, preceded spell of
 warning silence.
 
to-night, met, somewhat constrained, bore the
 signs internal struggle. put making a
 violent effort earliest instant so. few
 minutes, however, gave complete control herself; then, motioning
 husband sit beside sofa half reclining,
 made rest us bring chairs close. taking husband’s hand
 began:--
 
“we together freedom, perhaps last time! know,
 dear; know will always end.” to
 husband whose hand had, see, tightened upon hers. “in
 morning go upon task, god alone knows may in
 store us. going good take me
 you. know brave earnest men can poor weak
 woman, whose soul perhaps lost--no, no, yet, rate
 stake--you will do. must remember are.
 poison blood, soul, may destroy me; which
 must destroy me, unless relief comes us. oh, friends, you
 know well do, soul stake; though know there
 one way me, must must take it!” looked
 appealingly us turn, beginning ending husband.
 
“what way?” asked helsing hoarse voice. “what that
 way, must not--may not--take?”
 
“that may die now, either hand another, before
 greater evil entirely wrought. know, know, i
 dead set free immortal spirit, even you
 poor lucy’s. death, fear death, thing
 stood way shrink die here, now, amidst the
 friends love me. death all. believe die
 case, hope us bitter task be
 done, god’s will. therefore, i, part, give the
 certainty eternal rest, go dark may the
 blackest things world nether world holds!” all
 silent, knew instinctively prelude. the
 faces others set harker’s grew ashen grey; perhaps he
 guessed better us coming. continued:--
 
“this can give hotch-pot.” note the
 quaint legal phrase used place, all
 seriousness. “what will give? lives know,” went
 quickly, “that easy brave men. lives god’s, you
 can give back him; will give me?” looked
 questioningly, time avoided husband’s face. quincey
 seemed understand; nodded, face lit up. “then shall tell
 plainly want, must doubtful matter this
 connection us now. must promise me, one all--even you,
 beloved husband--that, time come, will kill me.”
 
“what time?” voice quincey’s, low and
 strained.
 
“when shall convinced changed better that
 die may live. thus dead flesh, will,
 without moment’s delay, drive stake cut head;
 whatever else may wanting give rest!”
 
quincey first rise pause. knelt her
 taking hand said solemnly:--
 
“i’m rough fellow, hasn’t, perhaps, lived man to
 win distinction, swear hold sacred and
 dear that, time ever come, shall flinch duty
 set us. promise you, too, shall make all
 certain, doubtful shall take time has
 come!”
 
“my true friend!” say amid fast-falling tears, as,
 bending over, kissed hand.
 
“i swear same, dear madam mina!” said helsing.
 
“and i!” said lord godalming, turn kneeling to
 take oath. followed, myself. husband turned her
 wan-eyed greenish pallor subdued snowy whiteness of
 hair, asked:--
 
“and must i, too, make promise, oh, wife?”
 
“you too, dearest,” said, infinite yearning pity her
 voice eyes. “you must shrink. nearest dearest and
 world me; souls knit one, life all
 time. think, dear, times brave men killed
 wives womenkind, keep falling the
 hands enemy. hands falter because
 loved implored slay them. men’s duty
 towards love, times sore trial! oh, my
 dear, must meet death hand, let at

 forgotten mercy poor lucy’s case loved”--she stopped
 flying blush, changed phrase--“to best right
 give peace. time shall come again, look make
 happy memory husband’s life loving hand which
 set free awful thrall upon me.”
 
“again swear!” came professor’s resonant voice. mrs. harker
 smiled, positively smiled, sigh relief leaned back and
 said:--
 
“and now one word warning, warning must never forget:
 time, ever come, may come quickly unexpectedly, in
 case must lose time using opportunity. a
 time might be--nay! time ever comes, _shall be_--leagued
 enemy you.”
 
“one request;” became solemn said this, “it not
 vital necessary like other, want one thing for
 me, will.” acquiesced, one spoke; need
 speak:--
 
“i want read burial service.” interrupted deep
 groan husband; taking hand hers, held her
 heart, continued: “you must read day. whatever may
 issue fearful state things, will sweet
 thought us. you, dearest, will hope read it, for
 will voice memory ever--come may!”
 
“but oh, dear one,” pleaded, “death afar you.”
 
“nay,” said, holding warning hand. “i deeper death at
 moment weight earthly grave lay heavy upon me!”
 
“oh, wife, must read it?” said, began.
 
“it comfort me, husband!” said; began to
 read got book ready.
 
“how can i--how one--tell strange scene, its
 solemnity, gloom, sadness, horror; and, withal, its
 sweetness. even sceptic, can see nothing travesty bitter
 truth anything holy emotional, melted heart
 seen little group loving devoted friends kneeling
 round stricken sorrowing lady; heard tender passion of
 husband’s voice, tones broken emotion often he
 pause, read simple beautiful service burial
 dead. i--i go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!”
 
* * * * *
 
right instinct. strange was, bizarre may
 hereafter seem even us felt potent influence time, it
 comforted us much; silence, showed mrs. harker’s coming
 relapse freedom soul, seem full despair any
 us dreaded.
 

_jonathan harker’s journal._
 
_15 october, varna._--we left charing cross morning 12th,
 got paris night, took places secured us the
 orient express. travelled night day, arriving five
 o’clock. lord godalming went consulate see telegram had
 arrived him, whilst rest us came hotel--“the
 odessus.” journey may incidents; was, however, eager
 get on, care them. _czarina catherine_ comes into
 port will interest anything wide world.
 thank god! mina well, looks getting stronger; colour is
 coming back. sleeps great deal; throughout journey slept
 nearly time. sunrise sunset, however, very
 wakeful alert; become habit helsing to
 hypnotise times. first, effort needed, he
 make many passes; now, seems yield once, by
 habit, scarcely action needed. seems power at
 particular moments simply will, thoughts obey him. he
 always asks can see hear. answers first:--
 
“nothing; dark.” second:--
 
“i can hear waves lapping ship, water rushing
 by. canvas cordage strain masts yards creak. wind is
 high--i can hear shrouds, bow throws back foam.”
 evident _czarina catherine_ still sea, hastening on
 way varna. lord godalming just returned. four
 telegrams, one day since started, effect:
 _czarina catherine_ reported lloyd’s from
 anywhere. arranged leaving london agent should
 send every day telegram saying ship reported. he
 message even reported, might be
 sure watch kept end wire.
 
dinner went bed early. to-morrow see the
 vice-consul, arrange, can, getting board ship
 soon arrives. helsing says chance will get
 boat sunrise sunset. count, even takes the
 form bat, cross running water volition, and
 leave ship. dare change man’s form without
 suspicion--which evidently wishes avoid--he must remain the
 box. if, then, can come board sunrise, mercy;
 can open box make sure him, poor lucy,
 wakes. mercy shall get us will count for
 much. think shall much trouble officials the
 seamen. thank god! country bribery can anything,
 well supplied money. make sure the
 ship come port sunset sunrise without being
 warned, shall safe. judge moneybag will settle case, i
 think!
 
* * * * *
 
_16 october._--mina’s report still same: lapping waves rushing
 water, darkness favouring winds. evidently good time, and
 hear _czarina catherine_ shall ready. must
 pass dardanelles sure report.
 
* * * * *
 
_17 october._--everything pretty well fixed now, think, welcome
 count return tour. godalming told shippers that
 fancied box sent aboard might contain something stolen from
 friend his, got half consent might open own
 risk. owner gave paper telling captain give every
 facility whatever chose board ship, also a
 similar authorisation agent varna. seen agent, who
 much impressed godalming’s kindly manner him, all
 satisfied whatever can aid wishes will done. we
 already arranged case get box open. the
 count there, helsing seward will cut head and
 drive stake heart. morris godalming shall
 prevent interference, even use arms shall
 ready. professor says can treat count’s body,
 will soon fall dust. case no
 evidence us, case suspicion murder aroused. but
 even not, stand fall act, perhaps
 day script may evidence come us and
 rope. myself, take chance thankfully it
 come. mean leave stone unturned carry our
 intent. arranged certain officials instant the
 _czarina catherine_ seen, informed special
 messenger.
 
* * * * *
 
_24 october._--a whole week waiting. daily telegrams godalming,
 story: “not yet reported.” mina’s morning evening
 hypnotic answer unvaried: lapping waves, rushing water, creaking
 masts.
 
_telegram, october 24th._
 
_rufus smith, lloyd’s, london, lord godalming, care h. b. m.
 vice-consul, varna._
 
“_czarina catherine_ reported morning dardanelles.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_25 october._--how miss phonograph! write diary pen is
 irksome me; helsing says must. wild with
 excitement yesterday godalming got telegram lloyd’s. i
 know now men feel battle call action heard. mrs.
 harker, alone party, show signs emotion. after
 all, strange not; took special care to
 let know anything it, tried show any
 excitement presence. old days would, am
 sure, noticed, matter might tried conceal it; but
 way greatly changed past three weeks. the
 lethargy grows upon her, though seems strong well, is
 getting back colour, helsing satisfied. we
 talk often; not, however, said word others. it
 break poor harker’s heart--certainly nerve--if knew we
 even suspicion subject. helsing examines, tells me,
 teeth carefully, whilst hypnotic condition, for
 says long begin sharpen active
 danger change her. change come, be
 necessary take steps!... know steps to
 be, though mention thoughts other. should
 neither us shrink task--awful though contemplate.
 “euthanasia” excellent comforting word! grateful to
 whoever invented it.
 
24 hours’ sail dardanelles here, the
 rate _czarina catherine_ come london. therefore
 arrive time morning; possibly get in
 then, retire early. shall get one
 o’clock, ready.
 
* * * * *
 
_25 october, noon_.--no news yet ship’s arrival. mrs. harker’s
 hypnotic report morning usual, possible
 may get news moment. men fever of
 excitement, except harker, calm; hands cold ice, and
 hour ago found whetting edge great ghoorka knife
 now always carries him. will bad lookout the
 count edge “kukri” ever touches throat, driven by
 stern, ice-cold hand!
 
helsing little alarmed mrs. harker to-day. about
 noon got sort lethargy like; although we
 kept silence others, neither us happy it. she
 restless morning, first glad know
 sleeping. when, however, husband mentioned casually
 sleeping soundly wake her, went to
 room see ourselves. breathing naturally looked so
 well peaceful agreed sleep better than
 anything else. poor girl, much forget wonder
 sleep, brings oblivion her, good.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--our opinion justified, refreshing sleep
 hours woke up, seemed brighter better had
 days. sunset made usual hypnotic report. wherever he
 may black sea, count hurrying destination. to
 doom, trust!
 
* * * * *
 
_26 october._--another day tidings _czarina catherine_.
 now. still journeying _somewhere_ is
 apparent, mrs. harker’s hypnotic report sunrise still the
 same. possible vessel may lying by, times, fog;
 steamers came last evening reported patches fog
 north south port. must continue watching, as
 ship may now signalled moment.
 
* * * * *
 
_27 october, noon._--most strange; news yet ship wait for.
 mrs. harker reported last night morning usual: “lapping
 waves rushing water,” though added “the waves very
 faint.” telegrams london same: “no further
 report.” helsing terribly anxious, told just now he
 fears count escaping us. added significantly:--
 
“i like lethargy madam mina’s. souls memories can do
 strange things trance.” ask more, harker
 just came in, held warning hand. must try to-night
 sunset make speak fully hypnotic state.
 
* * * * *
 
_28 october._--telegram. _rufus smith, london, lord godalming,
 care h. b. m. vice consul, varna._
 
“_czarina catherine_ reported entering galatz one o’clock
 to-day.”
 

_dr. seward’s diary._
 
_28 october._--when telegram came announcing arrival galatz i
 think shock us might been
 expected. true, know whence, how, when, bolt would
 come; think expected something strange happen.
 delay arrival varna made us individually satisfied things
 just expected; waited learn the
 change occur. none less, however, surprise. suppose
 nature works hopeful basis believe against
 things will be, know
 will be. transcendentalism beacon angels, even if
 will-o’-the-wisp man. odd experience all
 took differently. helsing raised hand head a
 moment, though remonstrance almighty; said a
 word, seconds stood face sternly set. lord
 godalming grew pale, sat breathing heavily. half
 stunned looked wonder one another. quincey morris
 tightened belt quick movement knew well; our
 old wandering days meant “action.” mrs. harker grew ghastly white, so
 scar forehead seemed burn, folded hands
 meekly looked prayer. harker smiled--actually smiled--the
 dark, bitter smile one without hope; time his
 action belied words, hands instinctively sought hilt of
 great kukri knife rested there. “when next train start
 galatz?” said helsing us generally.
 
“at 6:30 to-morrow morning!” started, answer came from
 mrs. harker.
 
“how earth know?” said art.
 
“you forget--or perhaps know, though jonathan so
 dr. helsing--that train fiend. home exeter i
 always used make time-tables, helpful my
 husband. found useful sometimes, always make study of
 time-tables now. knew anything take us castle
 dracula go galatz, rate bucharest, i
 learned times carefully. unhappily many learn,
 train to-morrow leaves say.”
 
“wonderful woman!” murmured professor.
 
“can’t get special?” asked lord godalming. helsing shook his
 head: “i fear not. land different mine; even
 special, probably arrive soon our
 regular train. moreover, something prepare. must think.
 now let us organize. you, friend arthur, go train get the
 tickets arrange ready us go morning. do
 you, friend jonathan, go agent ship get him
 letters agent galatz, authority make search ship

 madam mina me, shall consult. time long you
 may delayed; will matter sun set, since here
 madam make report.”
 
“and i,” said mrs. harker brightly, like old self she
 many long day, “shall try use ways, and
 shall think write used do. something shifting
 strange way, feel freer late!”
 three younger men looked happier moment seemed to
 realise significance words; helsing i, turning to
 other, met grave troubled glance. said nothing the
 time, however.
 
three men gone tasks helsing asked mrs.
 harker look copy diaries find part of
 harker’s journal castle. went away get it; door
 shut upon said me:--
 
“we mean same! speak out!”
 
“there change. hope makes sick, may
 deceive us.”
 
“quite so. know asked get manuscript?”
 
“no!” said i, “unless get opportunity seeing alone.”
 
“you part right, friend john, part. want tell

thought professor going break hysterics,
 just lucy died, great effort controlled
 perfect nervous poise mrs. harker tripped into
 room, bright happy-looking and, work, seemingly
 forgetful misery. came in, handed number sheets
 typewriting helsing. looked gravely, face
 brightening read. holding pages finger and

“friend john, much experience already--and you, too,

 mrs. harker began clap hands eyes sparkled. went on:--
 
“now shall speak. tell us two dry men science see with

 unconsciously, spoke:--
 
“the count criminal criminal type. nordau lombroso would

dr. seward’s diary
 

_29 october._--this written train varna galatz. last
 night assembled little time sunset. us
 done work well could; far thought, endeavour,
 opportunity go, prepared whole journey, and
 work get galatz. usual time came round mrs.
 harker prepared hypnotic effort; longer and
 serious effort part helsing usually
 necessary, sank trance. usually speaks hint; but
 time professor ask questions, ask pretty
 resolutely, learn anything; last answer came:--
 
“i can see nothing; still; waves lapping, a
 steady swirl water softly running hawser. can hear
 men’s voices calling, near far, roll creak oars in
 rowlocks. gun fired somewhere; echo seems far away.
 tramping feet overhead, ropes chains dragged
 along. this? gleam light; can feel air
 blowing upon me.”
 
stopped. risen, impulsively, lay
 sofa, raised hands, palms upwards, lifting a
 weight. helsing looked understanding.
 quincey raised eyebrows slightly looked intently, whilst
 harker’s hand instinctively closed round hilt kukri. there
 long pause. knew time speak was
 passing; felt useless say anything. suddenly she
 sat up, and, opened eyes, said sweetly:--
 
“would none like cup tea? must tired!” we
 make happy, acquiesced. bustled get
 tea; gone helsing said:--
 
“you see, friends. _he_ close land: left his
 earth-chest. yet get shore. night may lie
 hidden somewhere; carried shore, ship do
 touch it, achieve land. case can, be
 night, change form can jump fly shore, did
 whitby. day come get shore, then, unless he
 carried escape. carried, customs men
 may discover box contain. thus, fine, escape on
 shore to-night, dawn, will whole day lost him.
 may arrive time; escape night shall come
 daytime, boxed mercy; dare his
 true self, awake visible, lest discovered.”
 
said, waited patience dawn;
 time might learn mrs. harker.
 
early morning listened, breathless anxiety, her
 response trance. hypnotic stage even longer coming
 before; came time remaining full sunrise was
 short began despair. helsing seemed throw whole
 soul effort; last, obedience will made
 reply:--
 
“all dark. hear lapping water, level me, creaking as
 wood wood.” paused, red sun shot up. must wait till
 to-night.
 
travelling towards galatz agony of
 expectation. due arrive two three morning;
 already, bucharest, three hours late, cannot
 possibly get till well sun-up. thus shall two more
 hypnotic messages mrs. harker; either may possibly throw
 light happening.
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--sunset come gone. fortunately came time when
 distraction; occurred whilst a

“go on; go on! speak, command you!” said helsing agonised

_mina harker’s memorandum._
 
(entered journal.)
 
_ground inquiry._--count dracula’s problem get back own
 place.
 
(_a_) must _brought back_ one. evident; he
 power move wished go either man, wolf,
 bat, way. evidently fears discovery or
 interference, state helplessness must be--confined
 dawn sunset wooden box.
 
(_b_) _how taken?_--here process exclusions may help
 us. road, rail, water?
 
1. _by road._--there endless difficulties, especially leaving the
 city.
 
(_x_) people; people curious, investigate. hint,
 surmise, doubt might box, destroy him.
 
(_y_) are, may be, customs octroi officers pass.
 
(_z_) pursuers might follow. highest fear; order
 prevent betrayed repelled, far can, even
 victim--me!
 
2. _by rail._--there one charge box. to
 take chance delayed; delay fatal, enemies
 track. true, might escape night; be, if
 left strange place refuge fly to? not
 intends; mean risk it.
 
3. _by water._--here safest way, one respect, most
 danger another. water powerless except night; even
 can summon fog storm snow wolves. were
 wrecked, living water engulf him, helpless; would
 indeed lost. vessel drive land; were
 unfriendly land, wherein free move, position would
 still desperate.
 
know record water; do
 ascertain _what_ water.
 
first thing realise exactly done yet; may,
 then, get light later task be.
 
_firstly._--we must differentiate london part
 general plan action, pressed moments had
 arrange best could.
 
_secondly_ must see, well can surmise facts we
 know of, done here.
 
first, evidently intended arrive galatz, sent
 invoice varna deceive us lest ascertain means of
 exit england; immediate sole purpose escape.
 proof this, letter instructions sent immanuel
 hildesheim clear take away box _before sunrise_. is
 also instruction petrof skinsky. must guess at; but
 must letter message, since skinsky came to
 hildesheim.
 
that, far, plans successful know. _czarina catherine_
 made phenomenally quick journey--so much captain donelson’s
 suspicions aroused; superstition united canniness
 played count’s game him, ran favouring wind
 fogs till brought blindfold galatz. the
 count’s arrangements well made, proved. hildesheim cleared
 box, took off, gave skinsky. skinsky took it--and here
 lose trail. know box somewhere water,
 moving along. customs octroi, any, been
 avoided.
 
now come count must done arrival--_on
 land_, galatz.
 
box given skinsky sunrise. sunrise count could
 appear form. here, ask skinsky chosen to
 aid work? husband’s diary, skinsky mentioned dealing
 slovaks trade river port; man’s
 remark, murder work slovak, showed general
 feeling class. count wanted isolation.
 
surmise is, this: london count decided get back his
 castle water, safe secret way. brought from
 castle szgany, probably delivered cargo slovaks
 took boxes varna, shipped london.
 thus count knowledge persons arrange this
 service. box land, sunrise sunset, he
 came box, met skinsky instructed to
 arranging carriage box river. done, and
 knew train, blotted traces, thought,
 murdering agent.
 
examined map find river suitable the
 slovaks ascended either pruth sereth. read in
 typescript trance heard cows low water swirling
 level ears creaking wood. count box, then,
 river open boat--propelled probably either oars or
 poles, banks near working stream. there
 sound floating stream.
 
course may either sereth pruth, may
 possibly investigate further. now two, pruth more
 easily navigated, sereth is, fundu, joined bistritza
 runs round borgo pass. loop makes manifestly as
 close dracula’s castle can got water.
 

_mina harker’s journal--continued._
 
done reading, jonathan took arms kissed me. the
 others kept shaking hands, dr. helsing said:--
 
“our dear madam mina teacher. eyes where
 blinded. now track again, time we
 may succeed. enemy helpless; can come on
 day, water, task will over. start, he
 powerless hasten, may leave box lest carry
 may suspect; suspect prompt throw

 council war; for, now, must plan all
 shall do.”
 
“i shall get steam launch follow him,” said lord godalming.
 
“and i, horses follow bank lest chance land,” said mr.
 morris.
 
“good!” said professor, “both good. neither must go alone. there
 must force overcome force need be; slovak strong and
 rough, carries rude arms.” men smiled, amongst them
 carried small arsenal. said mr. morris:--
 
“i brought winchesters; pretty handy crowd, and
 may wolves. count, remember, took other
 precautions; made requisitions others mrs. harker could
 quite hear understand. must ready points.” dr.
 seward said:--
 
“i think better go quincey. accustomed hunt
 together, two, well armed, will match whatever may come
 along. must alone, art. may necessary fight the
 slovaks, chance thrust--for don’t suppose fellows carry
 guns--would undo plans. must chances, time; we
 shall rest count’s head body separated, and
 sure re-incarnate.” looked jonathan he
 spoke, jonathan looked me. see poor dear was
 torn mind. course wanted me; the
 boat service would, likely, one destroy ...
 ... ... vampire. (why hesitate write word?) was
 silent awhile, silence dr. helsing spoke:--
 
“friend jonathan, twice reasons. first, you
 young brave can fight, energies may needed the
 last; right destroy him--that--which has
 wrought woe yours. afraid madam mina; she
 will care, may. old. legs quick run as
 once; used ride long pursue need be, to
 fight lethal weapons. can service; can fight in
 way. can die, need be, well younger men. now let
 say this: you, lord godalming and
 friend jonathan go swift little steamboat river, and
 whilst john quincey guard bank perchance might be
 landed, will take madam mina right heart enemy’s
 country. whilst old fox tied box, floating running
 stream whence escape land--where dares raise lid
 coffin-box lest slovak carriers fear leave to
 perish--we shall go track jonathan went,--from bistritz
 borgo, find way castle dracula. here, madam
 mina’s hypnotic power will surely help, shall find way--all
 dark unknown otherwise--after first sunrise near
 fateful place. much done, places be
 made sanctify, nest vipers obliterated.” here
 jonathan interrupted hotly:--
 
“do mean say, professor helsing, bring mina,
 sad case tainted devil’s illness, right
 jaws death-trap? world! heaven or
 hell!” became almost speechless minute, went on:--
 
“do know place is? seen awful den hellish
 infamy--with moonlight alive grisly shapes, every
 speck dust whirls wind devouring monster embryo?
 felt vampire’s lips upon throat?” turned to
 me, eyes lit forehead threw arms cry:
 “oh, god, done terror upon us!” sank
 sofa collapse misery. professor’s voice, he
 spoke clear, sweet tones, seemed vibrate air, calmed
 us all:--
 
“oh, friend, save madam mina awful
 place go. god forbid take that
 place. work--wild work--to done there, eyes may not
 see. men here, save jonathan, seen eyes what
 done place can purify. remember in
 terrible straits. count escape us time--and strong and
 subtle cunning--he may choose sleep century, then
 time dear one”--he took hand--“would come keep him
 company, others you, jonathan, saw. have
 told us gloating lips; heard ribald laugh they
 clutched moving bag count threw them. shudder; and
 well may be. forgive make much pain, is
 necessary. friend, dire need giving,
 possibly life? one went place stay,
 go keep company.”
 
“do will,” said jonathan, sob shook over, “we
 hands god!”
 
* * * * *
 
_later._--oh, good see way brave men worked.
 can women help loving men earnest, true, and
 brave! and, too, made think wonderful power money!
 can properly applied; might do
 basely used. felt thankful lord godalming rich, and
 mr. morris, also plenty money, willing
 spend freely. not, little expedition could
 start, either promptly well equipped, will within
 another hour. three hours since arranged part each
 us do; now lord godalming jonathan lovely steam

 forehead forbids that. dear dr. helsing comforts telling me

 waterway chosen count’s escape back castle, the
 sereth bistritza junction, one. took
 it, somewhere 47th degree, north latitude, the
 place chosen crossing country river the
 carpathians. fear running good speed river at
 night; plenty water, banks wide enough apart to
 make steaming, even dark, easy enough. lord godalming tells to
 sleep while, enough present one on
 watch. sleep--how can terrible danger hanging
 darling, going awful place.... only
 comfort hands god. faith would
 easier die live, quit trouble. mr.
 morris dr. seward long ride started;
 keep right bank, far enough get higher

_1 november, evening._--no news day; found nothing the

_5 november, morning._--let accurate everything, though you

yesterday travel, ever getting closer mountains, and

 frowning precipices much falling water, nature seem held
 sometime carnival. madam mina still sleep sleep; though i
 hunger appeased it, waken her--even food. i
 began fear fatal spell place upon her, tainted as
 vampire baptism. “well,” said myself, “if be
 sleep day, shall also sleep at

 imperfect kind was, held head slept. waked
 sense guilt time passed, found madam mina still
 sleeping, sun low down. indeed changed; frowning
 mountains seemed away, near top a

_6 november._--it late afternoon professor i
 took way towards east whence knew jonathan coming. did
 go fast, though way steeply downhill, take
 heavy rugs wraps us; dared face possibility being
 left without warmth cold snow. take our
 provisions, too, perfect desolation, and, far we
 see snowfall, even sign of

 wolves come can meet one one.” brought our

“look! madam mina, look! look!” sprang stood beside the

 however, there. instant later, saw me. round

 night. completed stood beside again, saying:--
 
“at least shall safe _him_!” took glasses from
 me, next lull snow swept whole space us.
 “see,” said, “they come quickly; flogging horses, and
 galloping hard can.” paused went hollow
 voice:--
 
“they racing sunset. may late. god’s will be
 done!” came another blinding rush driving snow, whole
 landscape blotted out. soon passed, however, his

 time _knew_ jonathan far off; looking around
 saw north side coming party two men, riding at
 break-neck speed. one knew jonathan, took,

 louder closer. snow storm abated moment looked again.
 strange see snow falling heavy flakes close us,
 beyond, sun shining brightly sank down
 towards far mountain tops. sweeping glass around us could
 see dots moving singly twos threes larger
 numbers--the wolves gathering prey.
 
every instant seemed age whilst waited. wind came now in
 fierce bursts, snow driven fury swept upon us in
 circling eddies. times see arm’s length us;
 others, hollow-sounding wind swept us, seemed to

two voices shouted to: “halt!” one jonathan’s,
 raised high key passion; mr. morris’ strong resolute
 tone quiet command. gypsies may known language, but
 mistaking tone, whatever tongue words were
 spoken. instinctively reined in, instant lord godalming
 jonathan dashed one side dr. seward mr. morris the
 other. leader gypsies, splendid-looking fellow sat his
 horse like centaur, waved back, fierce voice gave his
 companions word proceed. lashed horses sprang

 levelled weapons flashing knives gypsies front, nor
 howling wolves behind, appeared even attract their
 attention. jonathan’s impetuosity, manifest singleness his
 purpose, seemed overawe front him; instinctively they
 cowered, aside let pass. instant jumped upon the
 cart, and, strength seemed incredible, raised great
 box, flung wheel ground. meantime, mr.
